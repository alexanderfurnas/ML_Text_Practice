GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:10.043 --> 00:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: The threat from
terrorism is real, but we

00:14.281 --> 00:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will overcome it. We will
destroy ISIL and any other
organization that tries to harm

00:18.585 --> 00:20.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

00:20.687 --> 00:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama's
effort to reassure a nation
worried about terrorism. We get
reaction

00:25.425 --> 00:30.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to his prime-time
Oval Office address.

00:30.130 --> 00:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: Chicago police under
investigation for civil rights
violations, as dash-cam video

00:35.569 --> 00:40.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is released of another
officer-involved shooting.

00:40.707 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's Politics Monday. The
2016 candidates weigh in on
terrorism and the president.

00:47.347 --> 00:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: Beijing issues its first
red alert for smog -- how one
group is trying to clear the

00:51.818 --> 00:53.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
air.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA GREER, Natural Resources
Defense Council: China's
pollution problem is caused by
about

00:56.523 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one-third by export to America
and to Western Europe. So this
pollution is our pollution,

01:03.797 --> 01:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I think we have an ethical
obligation to help reduce it.

01:07.634 --> 01:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:14.608 --> 01:19.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:19.313 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Americans today
weighed the president's Sunday
night address on terror abroad
and

01:27.220 --> 01:29.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at home.

01:29.957 --> 01:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, investigators
in Southern California sought to
shed new light on the

01:34.127 --> 01:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack by a husband and wife
who turned to militant Islam.

01:39.766 --> 01:44.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Bernardino County leaders
called for unity this morning,
as thousands of employees
returned

01:44.805 --> 01:48.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work for the first time
since last week's shootings.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUDY RAYMUNDO, Public Health
Director, San Bernardino County:
Today, I want to ask the

01:51.411 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community to mourn with us. I
ask that you come together and
hold each other strong,

02:00.887 --> 02:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it is this strength
that will help us heal.

02:05.325 --> 02:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Public Health
Director Trudy Raymundo was at
the holiday lunch where Syed
Farook

02:10.630 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his wife, Tashfeen Malik,
opened fire, killing 14 people
and wounding 21.

02:16.803 --> 02:23.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A focus of the probe now is
whether Malik radicalized her
husband and if she was, indeed,

02:23.043 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the driving force behind the
rampage. The FBI's David Bowdich
said today the couple

02:29.016 --> 02:34.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trained by taking target
practice, but it's not clear who
led the way to violence.

02:34.221 --> 02:37.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BOWDICH, FBI Assistant
Director: We have learned and
believe that both subjects

02:37.224 --> 02:41.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were radicalized and have
been for quite some time.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, how did that happen? The
question we're trying to get at
is, how did that happen and

02:45.399 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by whom and where
did that happen?

02:48.201 --> 02:53.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the attack began
last week, Malik pledged
allegiance online to Abu Bakr

02:53.807 --> 02:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Baghdadi, overall leader of
the Islamic State group. The
militants say she was a
supporter,

02:58.111 --> 03:01.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but have not claimed any
direct link to the attack.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: The threat from
terrorism is real, but we

03:03.183 --> 03:05.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will overcome it.

03:05.452 --> 03:10.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Last night,
President Obama sought to
reassure the nation.

03:10.724 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Our success won't
depend on tough talk or
abandoning our values or giving

03:16.530 --> 03:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into fear. That's what groups
like ISIL are hoping for.
Instead, we will prevail by
being

03:22.135 --> 03:27.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strong and smart,
resilient and relentless.

03:27.340 --> 03:32.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president did
not announce a new strategy to
defeat the Islamic State,

03:32.646 --> 03:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he did call for greater gun
control measures. They would
include not allowing people
whose

03:36.616 --> 03:41.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
names appear on no-fly
lists to buy firearms.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In San Bernardino, reactions at
a makeshift memorial were
lukewarm.

03:45.659 --> 03:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: He has to walk a fine line,
but it probably comes across as
a little weak, but that is

03:51.131 --> 03:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of Obama's style.

03:53.600 --> 04:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: It wasn't strong enough.
It appears to me, every time
that he talks on camera,

04:00.540 --> 04:04.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this is like a bothersome
thing for him, that he really
just does not want to have

04:04.044 --> 04:06.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to deal with this.

04:06.379 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Back in Washington,
the homeland security secretary,
Jeh Johnson, said today

04:10.650 --> 04:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will announce changes to the
national terror alert system in
the coming days.

04:17.023 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In related developments, the
Pentagon now confirms that an
airstrike last month killed

04:22.362 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic State's top leader
in Libya, and a strike last week
in Somalia killed a senior

04:27.300 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member of the militant group
Al-Shabaab, affiliated with
al-Qaida.

04:32.305 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day's other major story
comes out of Chicago, where the
police will now come under a
full-scale

04:38.078 --> 04:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal investigation. The
Justice Department plans to
review officers' use of force
and

04:43.283 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other issues. We will report on
this in detail later in the
program.

04:49.222 --> 04:53.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the day's other news,
negotiators on a global climate
deal moved into a critical

04:53.226 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phase in Paris. This is the
second and final week of the
U.N. conference.

04:58.565 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-Moon warned ministers from
nearly 200 countries not to

05:02.402 --> 05:05.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
duck hard decisions.

05:05.972 --> 05:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General (through
translator): The clock is
ticking

05:10.310 --> 05:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards climate catastrophe. The
world is expecting more from you
than half-measures

05:14.447 --> 05:18.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and incremental approaches. It
is calling for a transformative
agreement, an agreement

05:18.385 --> 05:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that opens the way for peace,
stability and prosperity.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Negotiators released
a draft agreement over the
weekend, which left all of the
critical

05:25.592 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disputes unresolved.

05:29.763 --> 05:34.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democratic presidential
candidate Bernie Sanders
outlined his own climate
strategy today aimed

05:34.568 --> 05:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at what he calls the billionaire
fossil fuel lobby. The Vermont
senator's plan aims to

05:39.673 --> 05:47.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut U.S. carbon pollution 40
percent from 1990 levels by the
year 2030. Sanders says

05:47.314 --> 05:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would ban Arctic and offshore
drilling, and he's calling for
an end to subsidies for

05:50.650 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fossil fuel companies.

05:54.588 --> 05:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Venezuela, they're still
counting the votes from Sunday's
stunning parliamentary election.

05:59.259 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's already clear the
results will challenge years of
Socialist domination in the
Latin

06:03.163 --> 06:05.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America oil state.

06:05.298 --> 06:09.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
has this report.

06:09.836 --> 06:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a
raucous scene throughout the
night in the streets of Caracas,
filled

06:15.108 --> 06:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with victory chants, car horns
honking, and people hugging,
after the opposition coalition

06:22.215 --> 06:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took control of the national
assembly with 62 percent of
yesterday's vote. A top
coalition

06:28.154 --> 06:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
official hailed the results,
even as the counting continued.

06:35.128 --> 06:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The morning newspapers confirmed
it: Opposition candidates won 99
seats to the ruling Socialist

06:46.306 --> 07:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party's 46, with 22 races
still outstanding.

07:05.425 --> 07:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Socialist President Nicolas
Maduro conceded the loss, but
blamed an economic war waged

07:10.430 --> 07:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by foreign elements and a bid
for power by the conservative
moneyed clash.

07:17.937 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maduro came to power in 2013,
succeeding the charismatic
revolutionary Hugo Chavez, who

07:30.050 --> 07:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ruled for 14 years. But with
falling oil prices, the economy
of this oil-rich country has
tanked,

07:36.623 --> 07:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with 180 percent inflation this
year and near-empty store
shelves.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Shifter is president of
the Inter-American Dialogue in
Washington.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SHIFTER, Inter-American
Dialogue: The economic situation
in Venezuela is horrible.

07:49.703 --> 07:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to think of another
precedent that's as bad as
Venezuela's. The inflation rate

07:56.509 --> 08:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the highest in the world.
There are shortages. People are
waiting for three hours to get

08:00.447 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toilet paper. It just became
absolutely unacceptable, and so
the performance of the
government,

08:05.785 --> 08:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, was on the line, and
the voters -- the voters had
their say.

08:10.757 --> 08:15.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The opposition
also demanded its jailed leaders
and supporters be freed,

08:15.929 --> 08:20.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like local Mayor Leopoldo Lopez,
serving 14 years for promoting
political violence. His

08:20.934 --> 08:23.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wife spoke last night.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LILIAN TINTORI, Wife of Leopoldo
Lopez (through translator):
Thank you for your vote. Thank

08:26.973 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you for fighting. Thank you for
resisting, which can get tiring.
We didn't get tired.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We did it.

08:32.479 --> 08:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This evening,
as Venezuelans waited for the
official final tally, the
opposition

08:37.417 --> 08:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced it captured the
two-thirds supermajority needs
to curb Maduro's near-absolute
power.

08:44.791 --> 08:49.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in Washington, the White
House said it's too soon to tell
if the outcome in Venezuela

08:49.329 --> 08:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will alter years of antagonism
toward the United States.

08:54.667 --> 08:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
France's far-right National
Front Party has scored its best
election showing ever in the

08:59.105 --> 09:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wake of the terror attacks in
Paris. Supporters celebrated
last night as the
anti-immigration

09:04.110 --> 09:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party won in six of 13 regions
in Sunday's first round of
voting. The second round is

09:09.149 --> 09:11.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next Sunday.

09:11.851 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The price of oil plunged today
to its lowest since early 2009.
It closed at $37.65 a barrel

09:18.625 --> 09:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New York, down nearly 6
percent. That, in turn, drove
down energy stocks and the

09:24.931 --> 09:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broader market. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 117
points to finish at 17730. The
Nasdaq

09:31.838 --> 09:37.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fell 40 points. And
the S&amp;P 500 shed 14.

09:37.444 --> 09:43.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this day marked 74 years
since Japan attacked Pearl
Harbor, plunging the United
States into

09:43.383 --> 09:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War II. In Hawaii, a
presentation of memorial wreaths
highlighted ceremonies
overlooking

09:49.589 --> 10:02.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the USS Arizona memorial. The
event also paid tribute to
elderly survivors of the attack.

10:02.936 --> 10:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In only his third Oval Office
address ever, President Obama
set out last night to reassure

10:12.045 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans that he has a plan to
fight ISIS abroad and protect
Americans from terrorism

10:17.484 --> 10:23.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at home, but is the
administration's response the
right one for the times?

10:23.056 --> 10:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ask those questions now or
Michael Mukasey, who served as
President George W. Bush's
attorney

10:28.194 --> 10:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general, and Juliette Kayyem, a
former assistant secretary in
the Department of Homeland
Security

10:33.533 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the Obama administration.
She's now at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Michael Mukasey, did he
accomplish what he needed to
last night?

10:40.406 --> 10:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY, Former U.S.
Attorney General: Not as far as
I saw.

10:43.543 --> 10:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if the goal was to
provide reassurance to the
American people that he's got a
plan,

10:48.081 --> 10:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see a plan. I see more
of the same, which has not
succeeded. There are plans out

10:54.320 --> 10:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. He didn't talk about any
of them. There is legislation
pending that would allow an

10:59.592 --> 11:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enhancement and a safeguarding
of our intelligence-gathering
capability. He didn't talk about
that.

11:06.266 --> 11:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are plans to position U.S.
troops, not large numbers, but
U.S. troops, so as to attack

11:11.905 --> 11:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS where it lives. There are
plans to deal with the
possibility of a safety zone in
Syria,

11:17.977 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so as to stop the exit of
refugees. He didn't talk about
that either.

11:23.349 --> 11:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a lot more of the same
and a lot of caution to the
American people about not
discriminating,

11:28.254 --> 11:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about not holding all Muslims
responsible, which is a -- he
cut a bloody swathe through

11:31.824 --> 11:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of straw men, but didn't
talk about much that was new.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Juliette Kayyem,
what do you think? Did the
president take advantage of
everything

11:38.798 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he has at his disposal?

11:41.000 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIETTE KAYYEM, Former
Department of Homeland Security
Assistant Secretary: In some
ways,

11:40.767 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yes.

11:49.175 --> 11:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
litany. And he did actually
discuss changes to the visa
waiver program, for example. I

11:54.113 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
actually appreciated the
statements he made, very similar
to George Bush after 9/11, about

12:00.153 --> 12:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Muslim community being a
part of the American fabric and
that integration of immigrant
communities

12:05.191 --> 12:08.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into this country
actually makes us safer.

12:08.861 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where I thought he failed or
could have been done more was in
twofold. One was, it was

12:13.232 --> 12:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot about what the government
is doing for us, and less about
what people might be able

12:17.870 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do for ourselves. And, in
that way, it didn't sort of
engage people in ways that

12:23.076 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those of us in homeland security
are hoping the government
engages, communities, whether

12:26.846 --> 12:31.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's see something, say
something, or even things like
even active shooter training.

12:31.918 --> 12:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are -- people want to be
empowered with what to do in
this time of unease. And I think

12:36.823 --> 12:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other issue, which is just
sort of I think a philosophical
issue, which is sort of, what's

12:39.659 --> 12:42.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the measure of success?

12:42.829 --> 12:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No expert, no presidential
candidate can sort of reasonably
argue that there will ever be

12:47.834 --> 12:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another attack. And so in light
of the fact there might be more
attacks, just given the

12:52.305 --> 12:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of threat we're facing, how
quick it is for people to become
radicalized, the access

12:57.143 --> 13:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to guns, I think he might have
prepared us that there will be
more attacks, and begin

13:02.048 --> 13:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get us as resilient as we
need to be for the kind of
threat we have.

13:04.651 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask
Mr. Mukasey about that.

13:09.055 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did he do enough to at once the
reassure Americans and to also
prepare them? It seems like a

13:16.496 --> 13:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tightrope that you have to walk
as president, prepare them for
the possibility of more mayhem.

13:20.199 --> 13:24.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: I
don't think so.

13:24.337 --> 13:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if anything, the
message was see something, do
nothing. The people in
California

13:32.145 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who did see something were
reluctant to disclose it,
reluctant to report it to the
authorities

13:38.818 --> 13:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of possible reaction by
their neighbors and possibly
being accused of profiling.

13:44.791 --> 13:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, this is December 7. It's
the anniversary of the attack on
Pearl Harbor. If FDR had

13:50.563 --> 13:55.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gone before Congress and
delivered the kind of speech
that President Obama delivered
last

13:55.168 --> 14:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night and told the American
people that the folks who
attacked us at Pearl Harbor were

14:00.039 --> 14:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not representative of the
peaceful Shinto religion and
that we must be very careful

14:04.977 --> 14:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to discriminate, and that we
have to be prepared for more,
and had said that he wasn't

14:12.218 --> 14:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to send a lot of troops to
occupy foreign lands, what do
you think the reaction would

14:15.054 --> 14:16.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been?

14:16.289 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he would have been
booted off the podium.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:18.391 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me to you
about that, because you worked
for George W. Bush, who

14:21.861 --> 14:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the 9/11 attacks very
famously appeared with members
of the Muslim community and
said,

14:24.931 --> 14:27.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is not about Islam.

14:27.967 --> 14:32.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there something else that
they should be doing? You talked
about racial profiling.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is this administration
encouraging or not encouraging
that you find is lacking on

14:36.542 --> 14:38.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that front?

14:38.311 --> 14:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: What I think is
lacking on that front is
encouraging people to actually

14:43.249 --> 14:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consider the fact that this is a
religiously-based doctrine that
we're facing, without at all

14:49.889 --> 14:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
condemning all Muslims or even
the majority of Muslims at all.

14:55.394 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a fine line to walk, but it
has to be walked. And I think
that the fact that the

15:01.033 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violence in this country that
emanated from this source
started in the 1980s, it
continued

15:06.572 --> 15:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 1990s, with the attacks
on our embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, attacks on the Cole,

15:11.944 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks in -- overseas, then the
first Trade Center bombing, the
second Trade Center -- the

15:18.451 --> 15:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second attack on 9/11, this is
all coming -- this all has the
same DNA, and talking

15:22.255 --> 15:23.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about that is important.

15:23.022 --> 15:23.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:23.756 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Pardon
me for interrupting.

15:26.092 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juliette Kayyem, I want you to
respond to that and also to this
idea that technology

15:30.930 --> 15:35.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
somehow has outpaced our
learning curve when it comes to
attacks like this.

15:35.168 --> 15:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE KAYYEM: Well, I think,
as respects to Muslim American
communities, I did hear

15:41.941 --> 15:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president actually mention
that this is a fight within
Islam, and that in fact it

15:46.445 --> 15:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the religion itself and
members of the religion who are
going to have to combat the

15:52.151 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struggle that makes violence a
part of these radical terrorists
who are attacking us.

15:59.058 --> 16:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that, he clearly said. And
that was further than he had
said before. But anyone who's

16:03.062 --> 16:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in counterterrorism, like
the two of us, knows, sort of
looking at the American

16:06.599 --> 16:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fabric, if you ask me, what is
the thing that makes us safe, as
compared to sort of France

16:12.438 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the systemic issues that
they're having, or Britain,
even, with the problems that
they

16:16.309 --> 16:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have with immigrant communities,
it is America's capacity to
integrate and even assimilate

16:21.180 --> 16:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all these different populations.

16:23.649 --> 16:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not perfect. We certainly
have a problem in this country.
No one's denying that. But

16:29.522 --> 16:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was very important, in the
context of the presidential
campaign and Obama's critics

16:34.927 --> 16:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some things that they have
said regarding, you know,
tracing Muslims and targeting
Muslims

16:39.699 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Muslims won't be president
-- I know that's the extreme,
but it is out there -- to say

16:44.570 --> 16:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forcefully that is not how we
either conduct ourselves as a
democratic society, nor is

16:49.375 --> 16:52.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it actually going
to make us safer.

16:52.278 --> 16:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just getting to the point
about sort of moving forward, it
can't -- as I said, you

16:58.017 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, we will face violence in
this country, given the threat.
It's not just technology.

17:04.223 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is that no amount of
intelligence can seem to be able
to at any time in our history
figure

17:10.596 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out what is that moment when
someone goes from not liking
America or not liking their

17:14.066 --> 17:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
position in life to violence?

17:17.136 --> 17:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it access to arms? Is it
radicalization? Is it that ISIS
is very good online? It's

17:22.408 --> 17:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of those things, possibly.
But no intelligence agencies,
not us, not the Israelis, no
one,

17:27.179 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can get to the moment
that stops every attack.

17:30.950 --> 17:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, our measure of success has
to be limiting the number of
attacks, and then having a
public

17:37.323 --> 17:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safety public response apparatus
that can minimize the deaths
when those attacks occurred.

17:42.495 --> 17:48.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you look at San
Bernardino, more people would
have died but for the actions of
very

17:48.167 --> 17:52.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
quick response by police
officers and public safety
officials, same with the Boston
Marathon,

17:52.872 --> 17:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same with that happened this
weekend in Britain with the
knife -- the stabbings in the
subway.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juliette Kayyem of the Harvard
Kennedy School now, and Michael
Mukasey former U.S. attorney

18:02.348 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
general, thank you
both very much.

18:04.383 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIETTE KAYYEM: Thank you.

18:08.387 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: Thank you.

18:13.659 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Chicago's police
department and the role of the
city's leaders were back in

18:19.198 --> 18:23.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the spotlight today, as
questions mounted about
accountability, police history
and what

18:23.402 --> 18:26.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened in another
fatal shooting.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The day started with the Justice
Department's announcement that
it will investigate the

18:29.141 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city's police force.

18:31.077 --> 18:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

18:34.280 --> 18:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The official
word came from Attorney General
Loretta Lynch in Washington:

18:39.552 --> 18:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department will
investigate what it calls --
quote -- "patterns and
practices"

18:41.954 --> 18:43.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the Chicago police.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: What we will be looking
at, again, is the Chicago

18:47.526 --> 18:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police Department's method and
manner of dealing with use of
force, particularly deadly
force,

18:52.298 --> 18:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and whether or not we find
racial, ethnic and other
disparities in how they handle
those

18:58.170 --> 19:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force allegations. It will
encompass a number of things,
including how officers are
disciplined

19:02.308 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the disciplinary systems.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Chicago Mayor
Rahm Emanuel initially opposed a
federal civil rights
investigation

19:08.814 --> 19:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as -- quote -- "misguided," but,
today, he says he welcomed it.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: We're going to
cooperate with the Department of

19:14.220 --> 19:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice as it relates to the
police department. And you
should hear from me it's in our
self-interest

19:19.225 --> 19:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a city for them to be here.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The federal
probe follows a furor over the
killing of 17-year-old Laquan

19:26.766 --> 19:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McDonald. Last month, the city
released police video of the
incident, more than a year after

19:31.637 --> 19:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it occurred. On it, officer
Jason Van Dyke is seen shooting
McDonald 16 times. Police

19:37.510 --> 19:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say McDonald had a knife, but,
on the video, he appears to be
moving away from the officers.

19:42.715 --> 19:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Van Dyke is now charged with
first-degree murder. But there
will be no charges in another

19:47.219 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fatal police shooting from 2014,
this one just eight days before
the McDonald shooting.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Video released today shows
officer George Hernandez
shooting at a fleeing
25-year-old

19:56.262 --> 19:59.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
named Ronald Johnson.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say Johnson had pointed a
gun, which they say was found
next to his body when he

20:02.168 --> 20:04.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fell.

20:04.970 --> 20:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State's attorney Anita Alvarez
found insufficient evidence to
take action against the officer.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County
State's Attorney: Even though
Mr. Johnson was running away
from

20:11.944 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hernandez and other officers, he
was running towards a police
vehicle containing two other

20:16.949 --> 20:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responding officers and unknown
members of the public inside
that park.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Furthermore, Johnson could have
easily turned around and quickly
fired at the officers pursuing

20:24.757 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him or even fired as he ran.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The lawyer for
Johnson's family denied he had a
gun and called the

20:30.429 --> 20:32.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prosecutor's reasoning
-- quote -- "a joke."

20:32.865 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER, Johnson
Family Attorney: When they all
saw the video, they all said,

20:35.367 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, he was about to turn and
point, because they had to
justify what Hernandez did. And

20:38.604 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
there simply is
no justification.

20:40.806 --> 20:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For his part,
Mayor Emanuel has already fired
the police superintendent,

20:44.143 --> 20:47.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he promised full
accountability again today.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAHM EMANUEL: I'm taking
responsibility for what
happened, and I take
responsibility for

20:51.417 --> 20:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fixing it in this action, and
part of every level of
government and service is
thinking

20:57.123 --> 21:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only about the future of the
city of Chicago, doing the
things necessary, and making
sure

21:01.026 --> 21:03.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you're held accountable
for the results.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Protesters, in
turn, say they won't stop their
demonstrations, demanding

21:06.899 --> 21:11.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both the mayor and the
prosecutor step down.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look a little deeper into
the federal investigation of
Chicago's police department

21:14.707 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and prior work by the Department
of Justice in the same vein.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vanita Gupta is the assistant
attorney general at the
Department of Justice. She heads
the

21:21.280 --> 21:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Civil Rights Division and
has led these efforts.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

21:25.651 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can we talk a little bit about
the timing of this? Was this
particular case, the killing

21:30.456 --> 21:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Laquan McDonald, was that the
impetus for the Justice
Department stepping in today?

21:35.394 --> 21:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA, Assistant U.S.
Attorney General: The impetus is
that we conduct a preliminary

21:38.197 --> 21:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
review that looks at all of the
available evidence, including,
of course, the Laquan

21:42.101 --> 21:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McDonald incident and response,
and we decide whether these --
we think that there is enough

21:48.340 --> 21:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a reason for the Justice
Department to open a pattern and
practice investigation.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we consider a bunch of
available information.

21:54.046 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
there's a lot of people in
Chicago who, as you know, have
been

21:57.983 --> 22:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complaining about police and
community relations for years in
that city. And many of them are

22:00.819 --> 22:03.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying, why did it
take you so long?

22:03.689 --> 22:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: Well, you know,
the Justice Department gets
asked to be in a lot of
different

22:06.425 --> 22:08.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jurisdictions.

22:08.961 --> 22:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we -- again, we look at all
of the available information.
There were obviously many more

22:13.699 --> 22:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
requests made in the last weeks
since the release of that video.
We took those very

22:17.670 --> 22:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seriously, and examined what was
available, and decided this was
the time to open up this

22:23.108 --> 22:25.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, about the
investigation, what are you
going to be looking into
specifically?

22:28.847 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: So, we're going to
be looking at use of force and
accountability issues.

22:34.053 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will say, these are two
very deep, broad areas for a
very large department, for the

22:39.458 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Justice Department to be
investigating. We will be
looking at the ways in which
officers

22:43.429 --> 22:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have used force, are trained to
use force, the ways of -- that
they are reporting and

22:47.366 --> 22:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being held accountable for
incidents where there may be
excessive use of force.

22:52.004 --> 22:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we will be looking at a
broad range of issues that fall
into those two areas.

22:56.408 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And with
regards to the McDonald case in
particular, there's a lot

23:01.347 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people in Chicago who believe
that there was a cover-up, that
not just the police department,

23:05.050 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that all the way up to city
hall, there was an attempt to
suppress the evidence about

23:07.586 --> 23:10.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this particular killing.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can the Justice Department
investigate that as well? Will
you investigate that?

23:12.791 --> 23:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: So, that is a
separate criminal matter.

23:16.428 --> 23:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, obviously, the criminal
investigators will be looking at
all the available evidence

23:20.399 --> 23:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pertaining to that particular
matter. But the work that -- the
investigation that we

23:25.271 --> 23:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced today is a civil
pattern and practice
investigation. And that is
really aimed at

23:29.908 --> 23:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at whether there is a
pattern and practice of
constitutional violations being

23:34.747 --> 23:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committed by the Chicago Police
Department in the areas of use
of force and accountability.

23:39.852 --> 23:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will, obviously, consider a
particular individual incident
as we look at whether

23:43.922 --> 23:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a pattern or practice,
but this is separate from
criminal investigations.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's say
you do find a pattern or a
practice. What happens then?

23:51.563 --> 23:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you try to
stamp that out?

23:54.400 --> 23:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: Yes, so after --
if we do find that upon kind of
a thorough review, we will

23:58.871 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
then issue our findings
publicly. It's something that we
think is important for the
American

24:02.775 --> 24:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public to be -- to understand
and be aware of kind of what we
have looked at and what

24:05.544 --> 24:08.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we found.

24:08.013 --> 24:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we would seek to
negotiate through a
collaborative negotiation an
agreement with

24:13.052 --> 24:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city to remedy the problems
that we found. And in the vast
majority of jurisdictions

24:17.756 --> 24:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the Justice Department
goes in, we are able to achieve
a negotiated settlement that

24:22.961 --> 24:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then will be court-enforceable
with a monitor, and that seeks
to remedy all the constitutional

24:26.865 --> 24:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violations that we found.

24:29.735 --> 24:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Our colleagues
at "Frontline" and The
Washington Post did an
investigation,

24:33.872 --> 24:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or really an examination, of a
lot of prior instances where the
Justice Department tried

24:37.943 --> 24:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fix problems within police
departments around the country,
and the results were mixed.

24:43.082 --> 24:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found examples of use of
force going up in some
departments after the
settlements.

24:48.454 --> 24:52.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Morale plummeted in others.
Community relations in many were
still deeply troubled.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think Chicago
will be different?

24:55.961 --> 25:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: So, just for
something that I think is
important to understand about
our

25:00.099 --> 25:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigations, is, when we
actually achieve an agreement to
remedy these problems, we

25:03.936 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will often, in those
jurisdictions, see spikes in
reporting because there actually
is data

25:07.005 --> 25:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collection, there's tracking.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because people
are just paying more attention.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: They're paying
more attention. They have more
confidence in the actual systems

25:11.510 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we have put in place.

25:13.746 --> 25:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that is actually quite
typical of our investigations.
We have also been recently

25:18.784 --> 25:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in places like East Haven,
Connecticut, and Seattle,
Washington, where they have
really

25:23.021 --> 25:27.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transformed the way that they
are engaged in using force, when
they are using force,

25:27.526 --> 25:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what kind of accountability
systems they have in place.

25:30.963 --> 25:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is resulting in very
significant reductions in the
uses of force, while keeping
crime

25:36.001 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and violent crime down. And I
think that that's really
important. In places like East
Haven,

25:40.305 --> 25:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have been able to document
transformed relationships
between the community and law

25:43.041 --> 25:45.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enforcement.

25:45.544 --> 25:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so these are -- you know,
look, policing is a very complex
-- it's a set of complex

25:50.115 --> 25:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues. And I think that we have
been working very
collaboratively along the
process with

25:55.888 --> 26:00.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law enforcement, with community,
listening to them directly about
what they're experiencing

26:00.592 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every day in order to come out
with the best kind of police
department that the community

26:03.796 --> 26:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deserves in these jurisdictions.

26:06.365 --> 26:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The head of
the FBI, James Comey, has said
that all of these criticisms

26:11.470 --> 26:15.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of police, all of these
investigations may in some way
be causing police to step back

26:15.441 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not doing their
job as effectively.

26:18.177 --> 26:22.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that that's true?
And, if so, do you worry that
yet another investigation

26:22.514 --> 26:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could suppress the work that
police are trying to do, because
they're scared?

26:26.118 --> 26:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: Well, so Director
Comey actually said that Justice
Department scrutiny is critical

26:28.720 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the field of policing.

26:31.523 --> 26:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what he did say -- and
there's obviously a robust
discussion right now about these

26:35.027 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues around whether there is
de-policing or not. And I think
the reality is, there

26:40.098 --> 26:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no data to back up the
assertions. We know that law
enforcement every day, police
officers

26:45.204 --> 26:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every day are continuing to do
what they do every day, which is
to put themselves in danger

26:48.440 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to protect the rest of us.

26:50.976 --> 26:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, obviously, though, we are
interested in accumulating and
collecting data. But,

26:56.782 --> 26:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for now, there is nothing to
contradict what police officers,
what we're hearing police

26:59.151 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officers say around the country.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The attorney
general in her announcement
today said she hoped that

27:04.456 --> 27:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this investigation would also
serve as a deterrent to other
police forces.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there any evidence that
that actually happens?

27:10.062 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA: Well, I have spent
a lot of the last year speaking
directly with law enforcement,

27:13.365 --> 27:16.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with police agencies
and the like.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what they are doing right
now is, I think, quite laudable.
They're looking at our consent

27:19.972 --> 27:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decrees. They're examining the
president's report on 21st
century policing. They are

27:25.010 --> 27:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to take proactive steps
to ensure that, if there is a
critical incident, that it
doesn't

27:30.883 --> 27:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create mass civil unrest and
that they are preempting,
through training, through
policies,

27:34.786 --> 27:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through changes that they are
voluntarily undertaking, so that
they can have constitutional

27:40.359 --> 27:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policing, while keeping the
public safe and, frankly, not
have a pattern and practice
investigation

27:43.996 --> 27:46.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if that can be held off.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I actually think there is
a very robust conversation
happening right now around the

27:49.768 --> 27:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country among law enforcement on
a whole range of these issues.

27:53.572 --> 27:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
acting Assistant Attorney
General Vanita Gupta, thank you
very

27:56.842 --> 27:58.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

27:58.644 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VANITA GUPTA: Thank you.

28:04.616 --> 28:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

28:09.555 --> 28:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Beijing issues a red alert, as a
layer of smog bears down

28:14.993 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Chinese capital; plus,
how an annual art fair inspires
Miami's local culture.

28:20.999 --> 28:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, we return to the
fallout from last week's San
Bernardino attacks.

28:26.738 --> 28:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidates have staked out
ground, some of it high, some of
it low. Today, front-runner

28:31.109 --> 28:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump said that the U.S.
should shut down all travel by
Muslims to the U.S., including

28:37.015 --> 28:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tourists. Other candidates
blasted the president for what
they said was a tepid response.

28:42.087 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even Democratic front-runner
Hillary Clinton said more needs
to happen.

28:45.757 --> 28:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: We're
not winning, but it's too soon
to say

28:48.894 --> 28:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we are doing everything we
need to do. And I have outlined
very clearly. We have

28:54.132 --> 28:56.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight them in the air. We
have to fight them on the
ground, and we have to fight
them

28:56.468 --> 28:58.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the Internet.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: We don't
need a president who goes on
national

29:01.239 --> 29:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television and lectures the
American people like a
schoolmarm, that condescends to
the

29:06.945 --> 29:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American people and says the
problem we have is Islamophobia.
No, the problem we have is

29:11.450 --> 29:15.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president and commander in
chief who refuses to recognize
our enemy. Our enemy is radical

29:15.053 --> 29:17.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic terrorism.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: And
people are scared not just
because of

29:18.957 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these attacks, but because of a
growing sense that we have a
president that is completely

29:20.826 --> 29:23.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
overwhelmed by them.

29:23.228 --> 29:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm very disappointed tonight. I
think not only did the president
not make things better

29:27.232 --> 29:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight. I fear he may have made
things worse in the minds of
many Americans.

29:31.236 --> 29:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC),
Presidential Candidate: The
president is misleading us about
the 65-nation

29:34.339 --> 29:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition. It's only on paper.
There is no answer, other than
destroying ISIL. The president

29:39.378 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has got the right goal. He just
doesn't have the right strategy.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.449 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: It's
Politics Monday.

29:44.449 --> 29:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for more on the response to
the president's address, we turn
to Tamara Keith of NPR and

29:48.620 --> 29:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, pardon me, of
The Cook Political Report.

29:52.324 --> 29:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to start, ladies, by
talking about Donald Trump, who,
this afternoon, put out

29:56.495 --> 30:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this statement saying that all
Muslims should be banned from
the United States, shouldn't

30:00.599 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cross borders, including
American-born Muslims who happen
to be abroad.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Where do we even begin?

30:06.872 --> 30:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Where to begin.

30:08.774 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We just -- for a guy
who continues to raise the bar
on saying and doing really

30:13.578 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inappropriate and offensive
things, he now raised it that
much higher. And you're starting

30:19.251 --> 30:23.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to see even Republican
candidates jumping on him and
saying this is absolutely
outrageous

30:23.021 --> 30:27.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and this is not at all
what we should be doing.

30:27.125 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Donald Trump has, thus far,
been rewarded for everything
he's said and done. Not only

30:34.332 --> 30:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does his support not go away,
but it hardens around him, with
the sense that he is the

30:40.372 --> 30:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only person that's saying the
things that everybody else
believes, but won't dare to

30:44.443 --> 30:46.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As we speak, there
have been denunciations from Jeb
Bush, who called him unhinged,
from

30:50.982 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lindsey Graham, from other
Republican candidates. Ted Cruz
has said, "That's not my
position."

30:54.786 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all he said.

30:56.321 --> 30:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Even Hillary Clinton weighed in.

30:59.024 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: She did. She tweeted and
said that this doesn't make

31:04.496 --> 31:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us safer. And she even added,
Donald Trump, the real Donald
Trump. She tweeted it herself,

31:09.067 --> 31:11.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the H. was there.

31:11.870 --> 31:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the backlash is
immediate and has come from all
ranges of candidates on

31:19.978 --> 31:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican side and on the
Democratic side. This is not one
of those things where

31:24.349 --> 31:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're just sort of backing
away and saying Trump will be
Trump. Pretty much of all the

31:28.420 --> 31:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates have weighed in and
said this is not the right thing
to be saying.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, Donald Trump is
getting the ratings he wants.
People are talking about him.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Here we are.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:39.164 --> 31:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He is driving
a news cycle once again.

31:41.967 --> 31:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's go back
to the previous news cycle then,
rather than helping him to

31:44.870 --> 31:48.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do that, and talk about the
president's speech last night.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The interesting thing is that
there was unanimity on the part
of all these Republicans, the

31:52.177 --> 31:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ones who spoke, and some of the
Democrats, that the president
didn't quite do enough

31:54.546 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, here's what Republicans
wanted. They wanted two things.
They wanted the president

31:59.484 --> 32:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say that we're at war with
radical Islam and they wanted to
hear him say we have a

32:04.022 --> 32:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different strategy. And they
didn't get either one of those
things. And they got a lecture

32:07.459 --> 32:10.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on gun control from the
president, which they also hate.

32:10.095 --> 32:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was pretty easy for them
to say that they disagreed with
it. What wasn't easy was

32:16.134 --> 32:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see just where Republicans go
next. Each of them has sort of
different avenue in terms

32:21.807 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of what they'd do to
handle ISIS and terrorism.

32:25.877 --> 32:29.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, if you're Ted
Cruz, you want the president and
several of the others to

32:29.948 --> 32:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say the words radical Islamic
terrorism, those words, no other
way of putting it. And if

32:36.288 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're Marco Rubio, you want to
say the president's weak. That
seems to be the theme that we
see

32:39.491 --> 32:41.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emerging.

32:41.226 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think that's a
pretty consistent theme that has
been coming from Republican

32:46.298 --> 32:50.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
presidential candidates,
Republicans on Capitol Hill,
that President Obama is not
using strong

32:50.735 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough language and that he
doesn't have a strategy.

32:54.940 --> 33:00.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, many of these same
candidates, when you look at
their strategies, their strategy

33:00.779 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to be very similar to
President Obama's strategy,
except, like, we would do it
better.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But a little bit
tougher, but a little more.

33:06.384 --> 33:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But tougher
or stronger language.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

33:08.720 --> 33:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But not a markedly
different strategy, aside from
Lindsey Graham, who talks

33:13.124 --> 33:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about something like 10,000
ground troops. Many of them are
saying the same things.

33:16.862 --> 33:19.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want airstrikes,
but more of them.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But they have turned
this into a critique of the
president than a critique

33:21.600 --> 33:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- rather than a critique
of the president.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Correct, more of the
style, including Hillary
Clinton.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Including
Hillary Clinton.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

33:28.039 --> 33:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she went on television
Sunday morning saying that she
had hoped that the president

33:33.378 --> 33:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going to outline sort of a
more muscular defense of his
strategy or give some new
proposals,

33:39.050 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which he didn't do. Notably, she
hasn't made any statements in
the wake of his speech last

33:45.056 --> 33:46.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

33:46.324 --> 33:47.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But was very quick
to make a statement about Donald
Trump.

33:47.893 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Statement
about Donald Trump.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, but that's
easier. That's certainly easier
for her.

33:52.063 --> 33:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's in a difficult position,
where she was part of the Obama
administration, she was

33:56.701 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the early development of
the strategy. And now she is
distancing herself, but you

34:03.541 --> 34:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't distance yourself too far.
And it's just tougher for her.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If you are going to
pick a fight, pick the easier
fight.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And going
after Donald Trump, for Hillary
Clinton, that is an easy

34:11.082 --> 34:13.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, here's the
other fight which seems to be
percolating to top on the
Republican

34:16.454 --> 34:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side, and that's Ted Cruz and
Marco Rubio, who kind of are
eying each other from opposite

34:21.159 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ends of the boxing ring.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

34:24.596 --> 34:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's sort of interesting
because, while Donald Trump is
taking up all the time and
energy

34:28.066 --> 34:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now, I think where many of
us see this race ultimately
coming down to is a choice

34:31.770 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between Ted Cruz and Marco
Rubio for the nomination.

34:35.941 --> 34:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're Ted Cruz, you're
hoping that Donald Trump
supporters, Carson supporters
ultimately

34:40.278 --> 34:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come to you. If you're Marco
Rubio, you are positioning
yourself a little bit more as

34:43.214 --> 34:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the center-right, as opposed to
more of the right candidate.

34:47.852 --> 34:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what Marco Rubio is doing
right now is trying to undermine
Cruz's bona fides on defense,

34:54.426 --> 35:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to take those supporters
who might migrate from Trump and
Carson over to Cruz.

35:03.568 --> 35:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, basically, let's try to
question Cruz's commitment on
national security, his support

35:11.276 --> 35:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for getting rid of the metadata
bulk collection system,
questioning some of his support
for

35:17.248 --> 35:21.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other issues in terms of
making him look weaker.

35:21.152 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So, are they
fighting for second place? Is
that what they're doing, hoping

35:23.788 --> 35:25.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Trump stumbles and
they get the fallout?

35:25.223 --> 35:27.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

35:27.692 --> 35:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are two senators who are
basically the same age, who have
similar backgrounds, Cuban

35:32.397 --> 35:33.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans. And they...

35:33.398 --> 35:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Similar ambitions.

35:35.400 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And similar
ambitions and are both also very
good orators from the Senate.

35:41.439 --> 35:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are looking at each
other and thinking that they are
going to be the final two, that

35:46.544 --> 35:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they figure, at some point, the
air will come out of the Donald
Trump balloon and it will

35:50.115 --> 35:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be between them. And they
are fighting that fight.

35:54.853 --> 35:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The great Ann
Selzer, who is a pollster in
Iowa we -- some of us know, and

35:59.491 --> 36:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who weighed in by saying, the
one thing about all these polls
we follow so obsessively,

36:03.528 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is up and who is down, is
that Iowans make up their minds
the last minute.

36:07.232 --> 36:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: They always do it
very, very late, and as do New
Hampshire voters, and a lot

36:11.403 --> 36:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it is determined by what had
happened in the state before
that.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So all right
now is just a dance?

36:16.141 --> 36:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: A lot of it is a
dance, but a lot of it is sowing
the seeds.

36:20.245 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, that's where Marco
Rubio, doing this much more than
Ted Cruz is doing it to

36:24.516 --> 36:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio, but sowing seeds of
doubt, sowing seeds of
questioning his commitment on
some of these

36:30.822 --> 36:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues when it comes to national
security, hoping that voters
remember that as they make

36:34.692 --> 36:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their last-minute decisions.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Final thought.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There are three or
four tickets out of Iowa, and
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio

36:41.433 --> 36:43.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are hoping to have
those tickets.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, and Ted Cruz
more likely to have that ticket
than Marco Rubio.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, absolutely.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You guys got right
to the ticket thing right away.
I thought we were going

36:49.074 --> 36:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do that later. We will
get back to it again.

36:49.941 --> 36:50.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:50.708 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank
you both very much.

36:53.511 --> 36:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the first time in six years,
Congress has passed, and the
president has signed,

36:57.515 --> 37:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a $300 billion transportation
funding law. Political director
Lisa Desjardins reports

37:02.353 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the bipartisan breakthrough.
You can find her report online
on what happens when politics

37:06.057 --> 37:19.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes right.

37:19.871 --> 37:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As thick smog bore down on
China's capital today, Beijing
issued its first-ever red alert.

37:26.077 --> 37:31.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's highest possible
warning prompted citywide school
closings and driving
restrictions.

37:31.816 --> 37:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The scenes are a stark reminder
of the huge environmental price
China has paid for becoming

37:36.721 --> 37:42.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world's factory, a problem
experts say the government is
now taking seriously.

37:42.227 --> 37:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One gauge of that is the free
rein given to a non-government
environmental group.

37:47.599 --> 37:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from
China as a part of his ongoing
series Agents for Change.

37:53.371 --> 37:59.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
inspectors came calling recently
at this massive textile factory
in

37:59.811 --> 38:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the eastern city of Hangzhou.
The plant is part of the
Saintyear company, one of the

38:05.517 --> 38:12.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icons of China's rapid rise as a
manufacturing powerhouse. It
produces two billion feet of

38:12.323 --> 38:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patterned and dyed fabric each
year for clothing makers and
retailers around the world.

38:19.898 --> 38:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This plant also produces some
60,000 tons of waste water, and
a 2013 investigation found

38:25.770 --> 38:29.440 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
it wasn't being
adequately treated.

38:29.440 --> 38:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Manager Wang Wei said millions
of dollars were invested to
upgrade the system.

38:34.546 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WANG WEI, Vice President,
Saintyear (through translator):
Today, we invited IPE in to show

38:40.552 --> 38:44.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them our changes, our
improvement in environmental
protection, so their inspectors
can see we

38:44.656 --> 38:47.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are in compliance with
government requirements.

38:47.158 --> 38:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But IPE, the
inspectors, are not from the
all-powerful government.

38:53.031 --> 39:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Institute of Public and
Environmental Affairs, is a
small non-government
organization.

39:00.605 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IPE founder Ma Jun has won
international awards for his
environmental activism, with no
apparent

39:09.013 --> 39:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objection from the government.
He's used technology and
political savvy to take on
China's powerful

39:14.953 --> 39:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial establishment, says
Linda Greer of the
Washington-based NRDC, the
Natural

39:20.024 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Resources Defense Council,
which has partnered with IPE.

39:23.661 --> 39:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA GREER, Natural Resources
Defense Council: I think he's an
astute observer of what are

39:27.298 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the problems and how can they
best be solved in China.

39:31.769 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ma was an
investigative journalist in the
1990s, when he began documenting

39:36.674 --> 39:40.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the toll of China's
industrialization, environmental
and human.

39:40.645 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MA JUN, Founder, Institute of
Public and Environmental
Affairs: Like in those cancer
village, a group

39:46.351 --> 39:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of old ladies kneeling down in
front of me, you know, holding a
bottle of polluted water

39:55.560 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and hoping that they would get
help, this is the voice that got
drowned in this complex

40:01.232 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
globalized supply chain system.

40:05.136 --> 40:10.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says
hundreds of millions of Chinese
have been exposed to health
hazards.

40:10.341 --> 40:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In our interview, which occurred
right after he injured his lip
in a bicycling accident,

40:15.213 --> 40:18.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ma said things are
approaching a tipping point.

40:18.750 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MA JUN If we don't handle that
right, this will not just
threaten our social stability,

40:26.057 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it could hinder the very
economic growth itself.

40:30.328 --> 40:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's not
hard to get a sense of public
concern, even anger.

40:34.832 --> 40:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
air is not good, and it's
getting worse and worse.

40:40.371 --> 40:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: At the
sidewalk barbershop outside the
industrial city of Tianjin,
people

40:44.876 --> 40:48.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shared their feelings,
though not their names.

40:48.546 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You do
feel the pollution when you
breathe. It's a lot more

40:52.950 --> 40:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
polluted than before. The water
is also polluted and our food.

40:57.722 --> 41:02.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
officials are corrupt. People
with money can buy favor.

41:02.827 --> 41:05.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Corrupt officials
are everywhere.

41:05.496 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ma says
there's growing political will
in Beijing to tackle the crisis.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Standards have been tightened
and factories are now required
to report their emission

41:14.305 --> 41:17.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
levels in real time.

41:17.809 --> 41:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IPE then makes this information
user-friendly to the public
online and now on mobile.

41:24.749 --> 41:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a large power plant just
outside the industrial city of
Tianjin, and it's one of

41:29.354 --> 41:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of industrial sites
across the country that are
monitored. And that information
is

41:34.826 --> 41:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
readily available to anyone
who's downloaded the IPE app
onto their smartphone. As it
turns

41:40.498 --> 41:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, this plant today is well
within the range of allowable
emissions.

41:46.070 --> 41:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you can see, there are dozens
of plants being monitored. Some
of them are in the red

41:49.574 --> 41:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
zone. And the one that we're
standing in front of comes in at
33.

41:56.681 --> 42:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But environmental concerns often
take a back seat to economic
growth. Local officials who

42:01.753 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are supposed to enforce emission
levels are instead rewarded for
creating jobs.

42:06.891 --> 42:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA GREER: There's sort of a
nobody will ever know mentality
down there at the provincial

42:11.429 --> 42:13.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and local level.

42:13.931 --> 42:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So IPE has
taken matters to the global
level, to customers, far
likelier

42:18.403 --> 42:21.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be sensitive about
their public image.

42:21.973 --> 42:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When IPE learned the Hangzhou
factory was out of compliance,
for example, it contacted

42:28.446 --> 42:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its biggest customers, including
Nike, Wal-Mart, Gap and H&amp;M.

42:33.684 --> 42:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MA JUN: They made very clear
commitment to sustainable
manufacturing and sourcing. And

42:43.161 --> 42:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we just want to hold them
accountable for that.

42:46.998 --> 42:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WANG WEI (through translator):
IPE convinced our brand
customers Not to place any order

42:52.804 --> 42:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from any supplier who did not
meet their environmental
requirements. IPE is trusted by
the public,

42:56.841 --> 42:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we can trust their data.

42:59.110 --> 43:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Because of
its size, Wang says his company
was able to afford the $30

43:04.515 --> 43:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million-plus upgrade. But he
says that may not be true of all
suppliers, who are often

43:09.187 --> 43:13.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pressured by their brand
customers to lower costs.

43:13.524 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ma Jun says the solution is to
make information accessible to
all parties.

43:18.796 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MA JUN: Many stakeholders would
like to join the efforts,
including, including even the

43:25.736 --> 43:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polluters themselves. You know,
they pollute. It's not because
morally they have a problem,

43:32.343 --> 43:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but more because the mechanism
now is rewarding those who cut
corners to save cost. So I think

43:41.819 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we can level
the playing field.

43:44.055 --> 43:49.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One way IPE
does that is by publishing an
annual transparency index.

43:49.927 --> 43:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MA JUN (through translator):
Today, I would like to announce
the top 100 brands and their

43:55.299 --> 43:58.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ranking and scores.

43:58.035 --> 44:02.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The index
ranks international brands on
how they have dealt with
suppliers

44:02.273 --> 44:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are violating pollution
laws. Are they working to reduce
emissions or increase recycling,

44:06.210 --> 44:08.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for instance?

44:08.379 --> 44:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MA JUN (through translator):
Scores have been on the rise.
And the score for Apple has
exceeded

44:12.817 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
70 twice.

44:15.119 --> 44:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Apple ranks
number one, ironic, since the
company initially declined

44:20.424 --> 44:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work with IPE. It relented
after IPE's investigations
linked several polluting
factories

44:26.931 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Silicon Valley giant.
Today, Apple and several global
brands use the group's

44:31.002 --> 44:33.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
data as a resource.

44:33.204 --> 44:36.240 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Here's retailer
Target's Ninh Trinh.

44:36.240 --> 44:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINH TRINH, Target: We look at
IPE to ensure that there are no
irregularities. What is

44:41.779 --> 44:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the progress of our suppliers
that have irregularities that
need to be reported?

44:47.919 --> 44:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Several,
like Macy's, J.C. Penney, and
Victoria's Secret, were rated

44:52.924 --> 44:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at zero. The brands insist they
monitor their suppliers. Macy's
and Penney told us they

44:58.095 --> 45:07.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never heard from IPE. The group
says each brand was contacted by
letter. Ma says IPE

45:07.838 --> 45:12.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will add brands on the next
version of its mobile app, not
just the factory names that

45:12.276 --> 45:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean little to consumers,
especially in the West.

45:15.980 --> 45:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA GREER: China's pollution
problem is caused by about
one-third by export to America

45:22.086 --> 45:26.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to Western Europe. So this
pollution is our pollution, and
I think we have an ethical

45:26.290 --> 45:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
obligation to help reduce it.

45:30.127 --> 45:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And even as
China begins cleaning up, she
and Ma Jun fear the global

45:34.699 --> 45:40.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply chain will migrate to
less expensive countries, eager,
as China was a generation

45:40.004 --> 45:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, to attract new factories,
but lacking systems to safeguard
the environment.

45:45.576 --> 45:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in Tianjin,
China.

45:50.181 --> 45:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fred's report was
funded in part by the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting.

45:55.219 --> 46:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A version of this story also
appeared on the PBS show
"Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly."

46:07.531 --> 46:11.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
art

46:11.335 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, one
of North America's biggest
contemporary art fairs wrapped

46:18.743 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Miami this weekend.

46:22.046 --> 46:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jared
Bowen was there to see how the
annual gathering is changing

46:25.650 --> 46:28.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the city's identity.

46:28.986 --> 46:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: For a week every
December, Miami becomes the
center of the contemporary art

46:34.525 --> 46:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world. Art Basel, now in its
14th year, is an international
gathering of more than 260

46:41.232 --> 46:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
galleries, 4,000 artists, many
big-name dealers and collectors,
and an estimated 70,000 art

46:46.771 --> 46:50.074 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
aficionados from
all walks of life.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH HOROWITZ, Director, Art
Basel Americas: Fairs have
become a real central meeting
point

46:51.509 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a lot of those
different constituents.

46:53.744 --> 46:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Noah Horowitz is
director of Art Basel Americas.

46:57.515 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOAH HOROWITZ: These are the
leading galleries anyway really.
And they're coming here to

47:01.919 --> 47:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show some of their best work.
So, collectors come really
because of the quality of the

47:06.057 --> 47:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
galleries and the quality of
artists on view. You don't get
this anywhere. And for us, that

47:08.192 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is what makes it so special.

47:10.461 --> 47:14.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Think of all the
works you see in museums around
the world. They're here,

47:14.932 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but for sale, from Picasso
masterpieces to a towering tree
by Chinese sensation Ai Weiwei.

47:22.173 --> 47:26.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's supposedly $3 billion
worth of art on display this
year, and the show has spread

47:26.977 --> 47:33.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across Miami to some two dozens
satellite fairs showcasing works
by artists from around

47:33.984 --> 47:36.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the globe.

47:36.220 --> 47:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chilean sculptor Ivan Navarro
says he has seen an enormous
shift for Latin American

47:39.724 --> 47:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
artists in just the past decade.

47:42.493 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN NAVARRO, Artist: When I
started showing here in 2005, it
was just the beginning of

47:47.998 --> 47:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Latino-American art being
available to the wide market.
And now it's absolutely an art

47:55.573 --> 48:00.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is recognized as important
as American art, as European
art. It's just part of the

48:00.077 --> 48:03.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
universal art history.

48:03.214 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED BOWEN: Navarro is
represented here by Maria Baro
and her gallery based in Sao
Paulo,

48:07.551 --> 48:07.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brazil.

48:07.985 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why are you here?

48:10.254 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA BARO, Baro Gallery: I'm
here because I want to sell. I
do to do sold out.

48:18.629 --> 48:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Frances Trombly is
a Miami native, this year
displaying work at a satellite
fair

48:23.901 --> 48:26.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called Pulse.

48:26.303 --> 48:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEYDEN RODRIGUEZ-CASANOVA,
Dimensions Variable: What we try
to do every December is
concentrate

48:29.607 --> 48:32.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the artists that
are working in Miami.

48:32.276 --> 48:36.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: She and her artist
husband, Leyden
Rodriguez-Casanova, are also
co-directors

48:36.914 --> 48:42.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of an independent gallery in
downtown Miami called Dimensions
Variable. They say they

48:42.019 --> 48:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have seen a sea change in
Miami's art scene since Art
Basel.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEYDEN RODRIGUEZ-CASANOVA:
Because of the fair coming here,
because of this new awareness

48:48.993 --> 48:54.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what is going on here,
there's a lot of people coming
to visit here, whether it's

48:54.098 --> 48:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curators, collectors, that are
kind of looking to Miami and
looking into what's happening

48:59.403 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the city. And the artists
that are working here are being
able to take advantage of those

49:03.240 --> 49:05.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possibilities.

49:05.309 --> 49:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: One of the most
visible signs of change since
Art Basel came to Miami is

49:10.214 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the graffiti-clad neighborhood
of Wynwood, a warehouse district
once avoided by locals.

49:15.820 --> 49:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's now a magnet for gallery,
studios and perhaps most of all
developers.

49:20.391 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG ROBINS, Developer: I build
neighborhoods. And to give
neighborhoods a sense of place,

49:26.630 --> 49:31.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I feel that art, design,
architecture are all important
components that can make a
neighborhood

49:31.635 --> 49:34.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really feel special
and different.

49:34.104 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JARED BOWEN: Collector,
philanthropist and developer
Craig Robins stands at the nexus

49:38.209 --> 49:44.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of art and commerce in Miami.
After helping redevelop South
Beach, in the '90s, Robins

49:44.882 --> 49:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started work on a desolate site
in Midtown, leveling abandoned
buildings to produce a

49:49.587 --> 49:54.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mix of high-end fashion and
furniture stores, all surrounded
by giant works of art and
renamed

49:54.625 --> 49:56.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Design District.

49:56.493 --> 50:00.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He also helped bring
Art Basel to Miami.

50:00.231 --> 50:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG ROBINS: Miami has become a
city where we define ourselves
with culture. And you

50:06.637 --> 50:13.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see many different examples of
that. Art Basel was clearly a
catalyst. There are incredible

50:13.277 --> 50:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art collections in the city, and
there are lots of museums that
exist or are merging

50:16.714 --> 50:19.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a new level.

50:19.149 --> 50:23.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Two of those
museums are the Institute of
Contemporary Art set to open

50:23.320 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a new building in the Design
District in 2017, and the Perez
Art Museum Miami, which

50:29.894 --> 50:33.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moved into a brand-new $200
million building in 2013.

50:33.931 --> 50:37.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANKLIN SIRMANS, Perez Art
Museum Miami: October 15 was my
first day.

50:37.668 --> 50:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Franklin Sirmans,
who only just recently arrived
from the Los Angeles County

50:40.938 --> 50:44.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Museum of Art, is the
Perez Museum's director.

50:44.642 --> 50:51.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANKLIN SIRMANS: In a city like
Miami, our past is short. If
you're going to the museum

50:51.248 --> 50:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of modern art, you have to work
through Picasso. There is no way
that you can deny that presence,

50:58.022 --> 51:01.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whereas, here, it's a
little bit shorter history.

51:01.825 --> 51:06.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: His task at the
Perez, take it from a place with
the base of community support

51:06.964 --> 51:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a shiny new building and
find the money to turn it into a
world-class institution.

51:14.038 --> 51:18.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another newcomer is Alexandre
Arrechea, a Cuban sculptor who
this week created a
participatory

51:18.375 --> 51:22.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
piece at the Cisneros Fontanals
Art Foundation downtown.

51:22.446 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ARRECHEA, Sculptor:
You have to remember places like
New York at some point

51:27.117 --> 51:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are very expensive to afford for
many artists, especially coming
from South America, and

51:33.524 --> 51:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miami suddenly becomes a good
opportunity, a place that you
still can afford places for

51:39.430 --> 51:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
studios and to create business.
There is obviously a big
competition here, but I think
there's

51:45.302 --> 51:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of opportunities here.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BOWEN: Opportunities, yes.
The fair brings in millions of
dollars each year to

51:50.474 --> 51:53.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the local economy.

51:53.410 --> 51:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some complain that amid all
the hype of Art Basel, the vast
sums of money being spent,

51:59.383 --> 52:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the VIP events, the focus is
too much on big-name outsiders
and not enough on the

52:03.087 --> 52:05.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
local scene.

52:05.556 --> 52:11.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We run the space because we feel
like the city and the community
and the people here

52:11.161 --> 52:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have things to say, really
important things to say. And we
want to foster that.

52:15.866 --> 52:18.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEYDEN RODRIGUEZ-CASANOVA: And
what ends up happening
sometimes, I think, with like
the

52:18.702 --> 52:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fairs is that you have got a
circuit of fairs, where people
travel the world. And they're

52:22.172 --> 52:25.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically looking at the same
artist in every single city they
go to.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED BOWEN: Part of the
challenge is to translate the
energy and excitement Art Basel
generates

52:29.646 --> 52:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the rest of the year here
in Miami and to define what it
means to be a great art

52:33.384 --> 52:36.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
city in the 21st century.

52:36.520 --> 52:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From Miami, I'm Jared Bowen
for the "PBS NewsHour."

52:42.393 --> 52:45.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see more of Jared's
coverage of the arts, which he
does for our Boston station,

52:45.662 --> 52:55.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on their Web site, WGBH.org.

52:55.572 --> 53:07.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: Nearly three million
Syrian children are out of
school,

53:07.418 --> 53:10.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
displaced from their
homes and communities.

53:10.621 --> 53:15.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one Syrian artist wants to
encourage young refugees to
return to the classroom, by
making

53:15.626 --> 53:21.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them cheerful places with
bright, colorful murals some of
the students even help paint.

53:21.131 --> 53:27.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find a photo gallery of
that work on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:27.304 --> 53:32.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": George Osborne,
British chancellor of the
exchequer,

53:32.176 --> 53:36.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the U.K.'s new role in
the fight against ISIS.

53:36.547 --> 53:39.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:39.416 --> 53:43.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:43.153 --> 53:43.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
