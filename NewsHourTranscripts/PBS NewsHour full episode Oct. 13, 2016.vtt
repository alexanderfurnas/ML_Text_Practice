weighing down an already

00:16.683 --> 00:23.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: after major losses in Iraq
and Syria,
how members of the so-called

have a musician

00:43.076 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
receive the top literary honor?

00:45.078 --> 00:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES TAYLOR, Musician: It is
literature,
and it meant a huge amount.

00:48.482 --> 00:54.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was world-changing

the defiant,
Trump perhaps at his most direct
yet.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
These claims are all fabricated.

01:32.259 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are pure fiction and they
are outright
lies.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These events never, ever

DONALD TRUMP: The Clintons are
criminals.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Remember that.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're criminals.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These attacks are orchestrated

Post Trump grabbed her from
behind in 2003,

02:15.502 --> 02:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

02:21.942 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of those women said Trump
reached up her
skirt on an airplane.

02:25.846 --> 02:31.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The women all said they are
speaking now because
of this moment in the Sunday's
presidential

02:31.051 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

for the record,
you're saying you never did
that?

02:36.923 --> 02:41.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have said things
that, frankly,
you hear these things I said.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I was embarrassed by it.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I have tremendous respect
for women.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

done those
things?

DONALD TRUMP: And women have
respect for me.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

DONALD TRUMP: They have
essentially corrupted
the director of the FBI.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a conspiracy against
you, the American
people.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

05:42.409 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These strikes are not connected
to the broader
conflict in Yemen. Those who
might threaten

05:44.177 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. forces should recognize
that we will
not tolerate threats to our
people. We will

05:45.045 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respond if our forces come under
fire.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The rebels' two
failed missile
attacks, yesterday and Sunday,
appeared to

05:48.748 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in reaction to a Saudi-led
strike that
hit a funeral in the Yemeni
capital last week.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world's longest-reigning
monarch has died.
The king of Thailand passed away
today at

05:52.352 --> 05:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the age of 88, after being in
poor health.
His death plunges that country
into a period

05:55.555 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of uncertainty, because of
concerns about
the son who will succeed him.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television
News has our report from
Bangkok.

06:04.397 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN MILLER: Thai TV
stations interrupted
all programs. "The king has
died," the palace

06:13.340 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spokesman said. "He has passed
away peacefully."

06:17.877 --> 06:25.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So comes to an end a reign of 70
years, King
Bhumibol Adulyadej. His name
means the strength

06:25.285 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the land, the incomparable
power. A wave
of grief spread through the
grounds of the

06:35.328 --> 06:40.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital where the king died,
beloved by his
now bereft subjects for his
self-sacrifice,

06:40.667 --> 06:45.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wisdom, munificence, the only
king most Thais
have ever known.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can him like a light.

06:48.308 --> 06:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes, the only bright
light for Thai
people.

06:57.484 --> 07:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: So, he was like
a guiding
star.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes, something like that.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: The body of
King Adulyadej
will now be taken to his royal
palace to be

07:10.263 --> 07:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ceremonially bathed. He will lie
for 100 days
in state to allow as many of his
17 million

07:17.637 --> 07:21.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adoring subjects to come and pay
their respects
as want to come.

07:21.775 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He took the throne as an
18-year-old engineering
graduate, the Thai monarchy at a
nadir. For

07:31.851 --> 07:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades, he traveled the lengths
and breadth
of his country, demonstrating
his concern

07:37.390 --> 07:41.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for his people. He wielded his
power deftly
and sparingly.

07:41.828 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in his long twilight, the
looming succession
crisis cast a dark shadow over
his realm.

07:48.535 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This, though, is the man who
will be crowned
King Rama X of the Royal House
of Chakri.

07:56.009 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will happen when the time is
right, Thailand's
military leader said tonight.

08:01.381 --> 08:08.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But 64-year-old Maha
Vajiralongkorn, King
Bhumibol's only son, is not
loved here like

08:08.388 --> 08:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his father. He is feared. He
lacks stature
and respect, and many consider
him reckless.

08:13.360 --> 08:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, though, Thailand's game
of thrones
is on hold, as a nation marks a
new milestone

08:22.268 --> 08:24.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and mourns.

08:24.371 --> 08:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Washington,
President Obama
praised the king as a close
friend and valued

08:30.944 --> 08:33.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
partner of many U.S. presidents.

08:33.880 --> 08:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Nigeria, officials say 21 of
the so-called
Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko
Haram extremists

08:39.986 --> 08:45.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
two years ago have been
released. A presidential
spokesman said the breakthrough
came after

08:45.592 --> 08:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiations with the militant
group. All
told, 276 schoolgirls were
abducted; 200 of

08:52.599 --> 08:57.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them are still missing. We will
have more
on the wider dire situation in
Nigeria later

08:58.004 --> 08:59.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

08:59.873 --> 09:05.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, there's been no letup
in the assault
on the city of Aleppo. Shelling
and airstrikes

09:05.178 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in rebel-held areas left at
least 11 people
dead overnight. Rescue workers
say renewed

09:10.950 --> 09:17.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombing there has killed more
than 150 people
this week. Meanwhile, Russian
state TV aired

09:17.390 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
footage of Syrian government
troops conducting
operations against the
opposition on the northern

09:23.263 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
edge of Aleppo. And late today,
at least 20
people died in a car bombing
near Syria's

09:28.735 --> 09:30.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
border with Turkey.

09:30.837 --> 09:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hurricane Nicole barreled into
Bermuda today,
with maximum sustained winds of
115 miles

09:37.010 --> 09:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
per hour. The Category 3 storm
peeled roofs
off homes and knocked out power
to more than

09:42.615 --> 09:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
26,000 customers across the
British island
territory. Amateur video
captured waves pummeling

09:49.756 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the shores, as winds whipped
rain into near
whiteout conditions. The storm
is expected

09:54.928 --> 09:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to weaken in the days ahead.

09:57.897 --> 10:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, some
progress was made
for North Carolina residents
still reeling

10:02.735 --> 10:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Hurricane Matthew. Governor
Pat McCrory
says the number of people
without power is

10:07.907 --> 10:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to roughly 44,000, from a
peak of 900,000.
Still, many communities remain
underwater.

10:14.981 --> 10:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The floodwaters were expected to
peak in five
counties today. Meanwhile, the
death toll

10:20.820 --> 10:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the state grew to at least 22
people.

10:24.657 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Transportation
Safety Board says
that the brakes were working on
the commuter

10:29.128 --> 10:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
train that slammed into New
Jersey's Hoboken
terminal. Last month's crash
killed one person

10:35.034 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and injured more than a hundred
others. In
a preliminary report,
investigators said they

10:40.106 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
haven't found any mechanical
issues with the
signal or train control systems.
Heavy damage

10:46.412 --> 10:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the front of the train is
hampering the
investigation.

10:50.617 --> 10:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were fresh concerns today
about China's
economy. Chinese exports in
September plunged

10:56.523 --> 11:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 percent over last year, due
to lower demand.
Imports were also down.

11:01.995 --> 11:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That weak economic data pushed
stocks lower
here. On Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial

11:06.966 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 45 points to close
under 18099.
The Nasdaq fell 25, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped

11:15.208 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
six.

11:17.176 --> 11:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how new allegations
against Donald Trump could shift
the campaign;

11:23.716 --> 11:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of Nigerians displaced
by militants
face another threat, starvation;
a legendary

11:30.356 --> 11:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musician wins the Nobel Prize
for literature;
and much more.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musician wins the Nobel Prize
for literature;
and much more.

11:45.738 --> 11:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to politics and
the fallout
from the latest allegations of
sexual misconduct

11:51.077 --> 11:52.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Donald Trump.

11:52.879 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get three views, from Carolyn
Ryan, senior
editor for politics at The New
York Times.

11:58.751 --> 12:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Maraniss, he's associate
editor at The
Washington Post and a biographer
of Bill Clinton.

12:04.791 --> 12:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And presidential historian Jon
Meacham, he's
the author of "The Destiny of
Power: The American

12:10.530 --> 12:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Odyssey of George Herbert Walker
Bush."

12:13.466 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

12:16.135 --> 12:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolyn Ryan, let me start with
you, since
The New York Times has been
reporting on this.

12:20.173 --> 12:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump today is saying
this is all lies.
He said he's going to prove that
they're lies.

12:25.144 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that The New York Times
is in collusion
with the Clinton campaign. Is
The Times completely

12:30.750 --> 12:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confident that these women are
telling the
truth?

12:32.685 --> 12:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAROLYN RYAN, The New York
Times: Well, a
couple of things on that.

12:35.021 --> 12:40.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as you probably know,
the Trump campaign
sent a -- or a lawyer from Mr.
Trump sent

12:40.660 --> 12:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a letter to us this morning
asking both for
an apology and for us to retract
the story.

12:46.566 --> 12:52.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our lawyer responded by
saying that we
wouldn't, but also saying that
we believe

12:52.905 --> 12:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is an issue of great
national concern
and that we believe the voices
of these women

12:59.412 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be heard, both by our
readers and by
voters.

13:02.749 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to your broader question of
whether we
believe these women, we do
believe these women.

13:08.388 --> 13:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reported very extensively on
their stories,
not just interviewing them, but,
as you saw

13:13.092 --> 13:18.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from their story, interviewing
multiple people
in both cases with whom they had
shared the

13:18.631 --> 13:19.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
story over the years.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me turn
to David
and to Jon.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jon, I will start with you.

13:25.605 --> 13:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have spent a number
of years looking
at American politics, campaigns,
presidents.

13:30.576 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does this compare, the
seriousness of
this compare to anything you
have seen in

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an American election?

13:36.849 --> 13:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM, Presidential
Historian: It's
right up there, without
question.

13:40.953 --> 13:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is almost as though Richard
Hofstadter
wrote "The Paranoid Style in
American Politics,"

13:45.491 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in a Jerry Springer context.
To some extent,
we have reached a point where
really the Republican

13:51.264 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
campaign is simply not
commensurate with the
challenges and the stakes of the
hour.

13:57.804 --> 14:03.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had negative
campaigning, we have
ferocious campaigning since
1796, which was

14:03.076 --> 14:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first contested election
between Adams
and Jefferson. But Adams and
Jefferson were

14:08.047 --> 14:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both plausible presidents. We
have reached
a point now, I think, where the
Republican

14:12.785 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has largely disqualified himself
from being
seen in the same frame as
Secretary Clinton.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Maraniss,
as somebody
who has reported on Washington
for a long

14:21.461 --> 14:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time -- as we said, you're the
journalist
who knows more about Bill
Clinton than anybody

14:24.831 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else -- how does this compare to
anything
you have seen?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MARANISS, The Washington
Post: Well,
you have to understand, first of
all, that

14:30.069 --> 14:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a vast, vast difference
between allegations
of marital infidelity and
allegations of sexual

14:37.110 --> 14:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
misconduct or sexual abuse.

14:39.912 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's apples and oranges, or even
more stark
than that. So, starting with the
Gary Hart

14:46.753 --> 14:52.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident in 1987 when he was
seen on a boat
with a woman who was not his
wife, everything

14:52.258 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has changed in American politics
in terms
of what's public and what's
private. Certainly,

14:57.296 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clintons were going through
that for many
years.

15:01.334 --> 15:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton had a special
prosecutor looking
at him for something else, for
the 'Whitewater

15:07.106 --> 15:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandal" -- quote, unquote --
and it ended
up being a sort of look into his
sex life.

15:12.111 --> 15:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, there, all they found was
one -- was
an incident of consensual sex.
It had nothing

15:17.917 --> 15:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do with anything in terms of
sexual abuse.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, something
very different.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolyn Ryan...

15:23.289 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAROLYN RYAN: I would just jump
in.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLYN RYAN: If I could jump in
for a second,
I think David is making an
interesting point.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that we're seeing
-- and I don't
know if you're seeing in your
news organizations

15:32.565 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but people are really making
this distinction
between kind of unwanted sexual
advances and

15:41.274 --> 15:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting it in a different
category from, say,
infidelity and affairs.

15:45.077 --> 15:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that seems quite
powerful in
this moment is that we're having
a lot of

15:49.215 --> 15:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women come forward on our
comment section,
our on Facebook pages just to
talk about things

15:54.554 --> 16:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have happened to them
either as young
girls or as young women or more
recently.

16:00.326 --> 16:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it feels like there's a
broader conversation
about this kind of behavior.

16:04.964 --> 16:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact, we
had a conversation
very similar to that about that
just last

16:10.570 --> 16:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night here on the "NewsHour."

16:12.171 --> 16:13.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAROLYN RYAN: Yes.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jon Meacham, what
-- should
there be a standard?

16:16.042 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What should the standard be for
what is important,
what's relevant in a
presidential campaign

16:21.047 --> 16:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this point? I mean, clearly,
if there are
serious allegations of assault,
you would

16:25.785 --> 16:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say yes, but what rises to that
level?

16:28.387 --> 16:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, I think the
Greeks had
this right a long time ago. And
that is that

16:32.692 --> 16:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
character is destiny. And we can
debate policies.
You opened your broadcast with
two incredibly

16:39.599 --> 16:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important stories, about which
the campaign
is not about, in an
ungrammatical way, Syria,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yemen.

16:48.774 --> 16:55.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are facing enormous
challenges, and we
have one of the major party
nominees who has

16:55.081 --> 17:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought this kind of tabloid
reality TV sensibility
into the mainstream of our
politics. And so

17:02.955 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of this is important.
Anything is important
as we decide whether or not to
hire someone

17:08.394 --> 17:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be in charge of the fates of
our children.

17:12.064 --> 17:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in that sense, I think
all of it is
worth discussing. The fact that
Trump is talking

17:18.437 --> 17:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a conspiracy, talking
about a vast media
conspiracy plays into some of
the oldest instincts

17:25.411 --> 17:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in American life, which is that
there is a
conspiracy out there, you are
not part of

17:30.149 --> 17:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, but I will make this right.
As Trump said
at the convention, "I alone can
fix this."

17:36.122 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's his only defense at this
point, is
to try to play to this populist
anger, which

17:40.593 --> 17:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is quite real. To me, what's
already concerning
is the day after. That is, if
Secretary Clinton

17:48.200 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becomes President Clinton, what
are we going
to do with 38, 39 percent of
Americans who

17:53.572 --> 17:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe somehow or another that
the media,
in collusion, managed to take
this election

17:59.812 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away?

18:01.747 --> 18:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just pick up
on that, David
Maraniss, because we are -- I
mean, I'm hearing

18:04.684 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and seeing everywhere voters. I
was traveling
this week reporting in North
Carolina, last

18:09.889 --> 18:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week in Georgia. Voters are
saying, I don't
want to hear -- this is making
me not want

18:13.859 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to vote. I don't want to know
about what's
going on.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How are we to think about that?

18:18.898 --> 18:22.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MARANISS: Well, people are
saying it's
making them not want to vote,
and yet the

18:22.068 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early returns from the early
voting are that
people are voting in record
numbers.

18:26.472 --> 18:35.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it's having that
countereffect. But I think
that things change the day after
an election

18:35.281 --> 18:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in ways that we can't predict,
not that Donald
Trump will go away or his people
will go away.

18:41.020 --> 18:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a tendency to look
toward the
future at some point. And so I
think that,

18:45.891 --> 18:51.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if Mrs. Clinton is the
president-elect, things
that next day will change in
some dramatic

18:51.630 --> 18:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways that we can't quite see
yet.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carolyn Ryan, Jon
Meacham was
saying a moment ago there are
other things

18:57.203 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going on in the world right now.

18:58.971 --> 19:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How -- as somebody who is at
such a prominent
news organization, The New York
Times, how

19:04.243 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you decide what to devote
time and resources
to? You don't have infinite
resources. How

19:10.649 --> 19:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much time do you decide at a
point like this
to spend on this or to spend on
where they

19:16.188 --> 19:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disagree on the issues?

19:18.057 --> 19:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLYN RYAN: Well, we're sort
of in a position
right now, especially because
it's the final

19:21.727 --> 19:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stretch of the campaign, where
we have to
do it all.

19:24.096 --> 19:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that, even in
the midst
of this craziness and sort of
insane part

19:30.069 --> 19:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election, the thing that
remains most
popular for us is fact-checking.
And people

19:35.074 --> 19:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still are interested in issues
and where people
-- where the candidates are
right and wrong,

19:40.946 --> 19:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they want to take the
country.

19:42.915 --> 19:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do worry a little bit, this
week in particular,
that everything is being
consumed by one story.

19:49.055 --> 19:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think, especially with
another debate
coming up, that there is going
to be an opportunity

19:53.659 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to press these candidates about
their vision
and about where they would take
the country.

19:57.329 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jon Meacham, in
the little
bit of time that we have left,
in looking

20:01.167 --> 20:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the sweep of history, how
much -- how do
historians look on developments
like this

20:08.140 --> 20:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as they involve our presidents
and our country?

20:11.310 --> 20:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, the great
question for
historians looking back on this
is going,

20:15.614 --> 20:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be to what extent did the
Trump campaign
effect reflect deep cultural
divisions?

20:21.253 --> 20:27.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only 19 percent of Americans
trust the federal
government. Household income has
been largely

20:27.793 --> 20:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stagnant. There's a significant
gap between
what it takes to live a
middle-class life

20:32.498 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what people are making. And
so to what
extent did this populist moment
tell us about

20:37.903 --> 20:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deep underlying divisions in the
country that
aren't going away the day after
the election?

20:42.108 --> 20:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David
Maraniss, finally,
as somebody who's reported, as
we said, on

20:45.511 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so many presidents and
politicians, what are
the questions you have at this
point about

20:50.282 --> 20:53.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump, about this
election that you
would like to see answered?

20:53.319 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MARANISS: You know, if I
could say something
self-serving, I think that the
mainstream

20:58.057 --> 21:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media's taken a lot of hits over
the last
10 years.

21:01.026 --> 21:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that Carolyn's
newspaper and The
Washington Post and many of the
other of those

21:06.098 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious journalists have done a
pretty terrific
job this year of trying to
explain the two

21:11.070 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates in this election. So,
the questions
have pretty much been answered.

21:15.574 --> 21:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're allowed to
use your
time in any way you want.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:20.179 --> 21:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Maraniss,
we thank you.
Carolyn Ryan with The New York
Times, Jon

21:22.515 --> 21:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meacham, thank you, all three of
you.

21:26.218 --> 21:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, we're going to give
you the chance
to watch and interact with every
presidential

21:31.123 --> 21:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate since 1960. That's at
watchthedebates.org.

21:37.096 --> 21:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate since 1960. That's at
watchthedebates.org.

22:06.792 --> 22:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we reported earlier, 21 of
Nigeria's so-called
Chibok girls, kidnapped by the
militant group

22:12.598 --> 22:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boko Haram, were released today.
But there
is a larger and more
far-reaching menace lurking

22:18.737 --> 22:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the war-torn reaches of that
country. It's
hunger. Aid groups warn of a
coming famine.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang has our look. And a
warning: The
story contains some graphic
images.

22:29.315 --> 22:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There is a calamity
in the making
in Nigeria's northeastern Borno
state. That's

22:34.687 --> 22:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the territory where government
forces have
been fighting Boko Haram for
years. Caught

22:39.725 --> 22:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the middle, as many as three
million Nigerians,
who, aid groups say, are in
danger of starving.

22:46.365 --> 22:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is also where those Chibok
girls were kidnapped
in 2014.

22:50.970 --> 22:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Post correspondent
Kevin Sieff
just completed a reporting trip
there, and

22:55.608 --> 22:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he joins us from Nairobi, Kenya.

22:57.977 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kevin, you write this morning in
The Post
about this growing humanitarian
crisis, this

23:02.681 --> 23:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
famine. How widespread is it?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN SIEFF, The Washington
Post: Yes, it's
massive.

23:07.353 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about a population
of more than
three million, far more,
probably closer to

23:13.859 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four million. Two million of
them are entirely
inaccessible. So, you have got
humanitarian

23:18.731 --> 23:23.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actors who have just started to
work in this
place of Northern -- this place
called Northern

23:23.102 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Borno state.

23:24.903 --> 23:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, even so, there are two
million people
who are basically -- they're in
villages or

23:30.509 --> 23:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're in cities where Boko
Haram still operates
with impunity. And so
humanitarian actors

23:36.649 --> 23:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't deliver food, they can't
deliver medicine
to two million people.

23:39.952 --> 23:46.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The other basically
million-and-a-half, actors
have just gotten access to them.
And so there

23:46.292 --> 23:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are food deliveries, but there's
just not
enough food. There's not enough
medicine.

23:49.962 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're just seeing massive
rates of malnutrition,
dozens of children dying every
day.

23:55.801 --> 23:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have talked to aid workers
when I was up
there who said they'd never seen
anything

23:59.305 --> 24:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this. It's just -- it's
huge.

24:03.008 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In your story, Kevin,
you write
very movingly about coming upon
a 6-month-old

24:08.147 --> 24:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
girl in a clinic. Tell us about
that.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SIEFF: Yes.

24:12.718 --> 24:19.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The girl's name was Fana Ali.
She was 6 months
old. She looked like she had
just been born.

24:19.291 --> 24:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was tiny. She basically had
been malnourished
since birth. And she was in a
clinic run by

24:27.633 --> 24:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctors Without Borders in a
small city called
Banki right on the Cameroonian
border.

24:34.707 --> 24:42.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And she had malaria and
malnutrition. The
doctors tried really valiantly
to save her

24:42.614 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this little clinic with no
electricity,
basically no medicine, almost no
resources

24:46.985 --> 24:48.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

24:48.787 --> 24:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, ultimately, they had to try
to get her
out of there, but the place is
so dangerous,

24:53.459 --> 24:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's so hard to leave by road.
They had to
get an escort from the military,
from the

24:57.463 --> 25:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cameroonian military. And that
escort basically
just didn't come for reasons
that no one really

25:03.268 --> 25:05.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
knows.

25:05.137 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just after the escort was
rejected, the
baby girl died. And, you know,
it's a tragedy.

25:14.213 --> 25:19.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And seeing it is horrific for me
and for the
people who were trying to save
her.

25:19.918 --> 25:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, ultimately, it's the kind
of thing that
is just happening hourly in
northeastern Nigeria

25:25.991 --> 25:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. It's happening all the
time. There is
just not enough assistance.
There's not enough

25:31.397 --> 25:37.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
food. There are children
starving to death
all -- just all over that
region.

25:37.136 --> 25:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I find so striking and
sad about
it is that this has been going
on for a long

25:42.841 --> 25:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, you know? I mean, these
places were
liberated from Boko Haram about
a year-and-a-half

25:47.079 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. And we have seen children
like Fana Ali
starving and dying since then.
And assistance

25:54.219 --> 25:55.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still isn't coming.

25:56.021 --> 26:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Why is it taking so
long? Why has
it taken so long for this famine
to become

26:00.826 --> 26:02.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
known?

26:02.628 --> 26:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SIEFF: I think part of it
is that it's
so dangerous. It's difficult for
aid workers,

26:06.398 --> 26:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's different for journalists
to get access
to these places.

26:09.568 --> 26:17.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it took a long time for a
lot of people,
including us, to learn just how
dire things

26:17.242 --> 26:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really were. I think that's one
reason. I
think another reason is, there
was just a

26:22.681 --> 26:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
total institutional failure both
at the U.N.
and within other international
NGOs that really

26:30.155 --> 26:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should have known how bad things
were, but
simply didn't have the resources
in Nigeria,

26:35.761 --> 26:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have strong enough teams,
weren't trying
hard enough to find out what the
situation

26:41.900 --> 26:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really looked like outside of
the capital
of the state.

26:46.038 --> 26:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as soon as they did get
access or kind
of tried to leave the capital,
these horrific

26:52.711 --> 26:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
images started coming out. So, I
think it's
a combination of those factors,
and those

26:59.117 --> 27:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factors continue to plague the
response.

27:02.721 --> 27:08.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even in places that are
relatively safe, like
Maiduguri, the capital of Borno,
you have

27:08.727 --> 27:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got severe acute malnutrition
rates that are
the highest in the world. You
have the return

27:13.565 --> 27:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of polio, the first polio cases
in Africa
in about two years.

27:19.404 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By almost every measure, this is
a crisis
as bad as we have seen anywhere
in sub-Saharan

27:26.411 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Africa in a very long time.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kevin Sieff of The
Washington Post,
thank you very much for your
reporting on

27:31.450 --> 27:35.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this very troubling story.
Thanks for being
with us.

27:35.187 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SIEFF: Thank you.

27:42.361 --> 27:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turning to Iraq,
the battle
for the ISIS-controlled city of
Mosul is now

27:49.902 --> 27:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking shape, and with it, the
hopes of the
Iraqi government that the last
major foothold

27:55.607 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the terrorist group in that
country can
be retaken.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what is the overall status
of ISIS?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham looks for some
answers.

28:03.982 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At its peak
between November
of 2014 and May of 2015, ISIS
controlled large

28:10.422 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of Iraq and Syria, but,
since then,
ISIS has taken serious losses on
the battlefield

28:15.727 --> 28:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and has lost critical territory.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To understand what this means
for the group's
future, I'm joined by two people
who studied

28:22.367 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS in great detail.

28:24.136 --> 28:27.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Peter Neumann runs the
International Center
for the Study of Radicalization
at King's

28:27.739 --> 28:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
College in London. And Rukmini
Callimachi
is a reporter at The New York
Times.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rukmini, I would like to start
with you, if
you don't mind.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI, The New York
Times: Sure.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Give us a
status report.
How is ISIS doing right now?
Where are they

28:40.786 --> 28:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operating? And how are they
doing?

28:42.588 --> 28:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: They have
certainly lost
some territory both in Iraq and
also more

28:47.259 --> 28:49.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recently in Libya.

28:49.394 --> 28:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen that there has
been a significant
dip in their output in terms of
their propaganda.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're putting out less videos,
less images,
et cetera.

28:57.869 --> 29:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wouldn't be quick to
declare victory
of any kind. This is a group
that has shown

29:04.042 --> 29:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself to be very nimble. And
despite their
losses on the battlefield, we're
seeing that

29:08.847 --> 29:14.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attacks in the West are
continuing to proliferate.
Just in the last couple of days,
German officials

29:14.786 --> 29:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were able to dismantle a plot in
Germany that
was meant to be against the
Berlin Airport

29:20.726 --> 29:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possibly, and that, according to
the officials
I have spoken to, could have
looked as bad

29:25.697 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the Brussels attack that we
saw in March
of this year.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Peter Neumann,
is there
anything you would add to that
about how ISIS

29:31.770 --> 29:33.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is doing globally?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NEUMANN, Director,
International Center
for the Study of Radicalization,
King's College:

29:35.273 --> 29:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, there are still an
estimated 10,000
foreign fighters in ISIS
territory.

29:39.711 --> 29:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Syria and Iraq fall, those
10,000 will
have to go somewhere. Some will
go to Turkey.

29:45.684 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some will try to return to their
home countries.
Others will try to go to other
battlefronts.

29:50.889 --> 29:57.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think the story of ISIS is
not over once
ISIS is defeated in Syria and
Iraq.

29:57.162 --> 30:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Peter, just
staying with
you for a moment, your center
just put out

30:01.633 --> 30:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a study that showed how ISIS is
increasingly
recruiting individuals who have
criminal backgrounds.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder, just tell me, what
is it that
you have found?

30:11.943 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEUMANN: So, if you speak
to European
security agencies, they will
tell you that,

30:17.516 --> 30:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Germany, for example, 66
percent of ISIS
recruits were known to police.

30:22.688 --> 30:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The same picture in Norway, the
Netherlands,
Belgium, France. A lot of former
criminals

30:28.393 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are becoming attracted to ISIS.
The head of
Brussels police is talking about
ISIS as the

30:34.199 --> 30:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super gang, and it's kind of
true, because
ISIS offers in many ways what
gangs are offering,

30:40.405 --> 30:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a strong sense of identity,
power, a sense
of strength. And it kind of
recruits in the

30:47.145 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same areas, often very deprived,
socioeconomically
marginalized areas, the suburbs
of Paris and

30:53.785 --> 30:55.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those of Brussels.

30:55.620 --> 30:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very different type of
recruit from
the more sort of intellectual
types that we

30:59.558 --> 31:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saw in al-Qaida 15 years ago.

31:01.793 --> 31:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rukmini, this
seems to fly
in the face of what we -- what
many people

31:05.964 --> 31:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe, that ISIS is largely an
ideologically,
religiously-driven organization.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: I don't
think that follows,
William.

31:14.773 --> 31:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Peter's excellent
report shows
that one of the interesting
outcomes of this

31:20.679 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recruitment of people in the
criminal underworld
is that ISIS has put a great
accent in cloaking

31:27.018 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their actions in religious
language.

31:29.521 --> 31:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, one of the
techniques that
ISIS recruits are asked to use
when they're

31:35.160 --> 31:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to travel to Syria and
they need to
raise funds for the trip is,
they're told

31:40.298 --> 31:47.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to basically carry out
burglaries, credit
card fraud, everything from that
to stealing

31:47.339 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cars, et cetera.

31:49.141 --> 31:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the word that ISIS uses to
describe these
stolen goods is canima (ph).
Canima is an

31:54.412 --> 32:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arabic term which means the
spoils of war.
And it's a term that appears in
Islamic scripture

32:01.787 --> 32:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to describe what happened during
the time
of the Prophet Mohammed, when he
and his companions

32:07.726 --> 32:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going into areas that they
were invading
and taking the spoils of those
areas. So,

32:13.632 --> 32:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically credit card fraud
becomes a religious
action, in their view.

32:19.504 --> 32:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was in Germany a couple
of months ago,
and I had the chance to
interview Harry Sarfo,

32:24.242 --> 32:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is a jihadist who was with
ISIS' special
forces, he told me specifically
that ISIS

32:30.115 --> 32:36.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was looking for people with
criminal connections
for a number of reasons, among
them because,

32:36.388 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Europe, it's not so easy to
get guns, to
get ammunition, to get weapons.

32:40.592 --> 32:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, by tapping into these
criminal underworlds,
they are able to then set up the
networks

32:45.630 --> 32:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they need to be able to
carry out attacks.

32:48.300 --> 32:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Peter, does
this connection,
seeing this connection between
the criminal

32:52.971 --> 32:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underworld and ISIS offer law
enforcement
any obvious anti-ISIS strategy
that they're

32:58.944 --> 33:00.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not currently using?

33:00.779 --> 33:09.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NEUMANN: Well, it
definitely asks them
to think differently, because
becoming pious

33:09.054 --> 33:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't necessarily mean that
you stop being
a criminal, and not being pious
doesn't necessarily

33:14.059 --> 33:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you're not being radical.

33:16.361 --> 33:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, it means that we have to
think, for
example, that things like
countering terrorism

33:20.732 --> 33:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finance in a different way. A
lot of the financing
of terrorist attacks in Europe
never enters

33:27.172 --> 33:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international financial
system. It doesn't
show up on bank accounts. It is
being financed

33:33.044 --> 33:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through petty crime, through
drug dealing,
through credit card fraud,
through counterfeit,

33:38.383 --> 33:40.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
illicit trade.

33:40.452 --> 33:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that needs to be paid a lot
more attention
to. In many ways, criminal
policing and counterterrorism

33:44.923 --> 33:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policing are becoming one and
the same thing.

33:48.026 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rukmini, one
of the things
that we have heard a great deal
here in the

33:52.163 --> 33:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. is, President Obama has
said that, as
ISIS continues to lose territory
in Iraq and

33:57.969 --> 34:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, that that is partly why
we are seeing
these attacks domestically, and
that it's

34:03.909 --> 34:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them lashing out, in a sense.

34:05.644 --> 34:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand that you don't
necessarily buy
that as a theory. Can you
explain why?

34:10.148 --> 34:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Sure.

34:11.917 --> 34:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't buy it because the data
doesn't back
it up. This is a group that was
trying to

34:15.420 --> 34:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send fighters from its earliest
days. And
it had the strategy of exporting
terror at

34:20.926 --> 34:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same time that it had a
strategy of holding
ground.

34:25.063 --> 34:29.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what I think is partially
correct and
what the administration is
saying is that,

34:29.935 --> 34:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Peter pointed out, you have
these 10,000
foreign fighters who are trapped
in Iraq and

34:34.906 --> 34:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria right now. Some of them
are, of course,
going to with be killed in
airstrikes and

34:40.645 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to be eliminated that
way.

34:43.214 --> 34:50.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But as the caliphate is
strangled and is erased,
those people have to go
somewhere. And so

34:50.655 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is, of course, concern
that the pace
of attacks will increase as
Mosul falls and

34:58.163 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eventually as Raqqa falls.

34:59.998 --> 35:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Peter Neumann
and Rukmini Callimachi, thank
you both very

35:03.168 --> 35:04.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

35:04.169 --> 35:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Thank you.

35:07.639 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NEUMANN: Thank you.

35:14.212 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the first of
two perspectives
on the presidential campaign
from business

35:21.286 --> 35:23.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaders.

35:23.054 --> 35:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, economics correspondent
Paul Solman
talks to LinkedIn co-founder and
executive

35:27.359 --> 35:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chairman Reid Hoffman. Hoffman
is a supporter
of and donor to Hillary Clinton.
And he is

35:33.431 --> 35:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speaking out against Donald
Trump.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense.

35:39.104 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In Silicon Valley,
Donald Trump
is anathema to many high-tech
executives.

35:46.111 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But billionaire Reid Hoffman is
a rare one
who is defying him publicly.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, why aren't there others?

35:53.051 --> 35:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN, Co-Founder,
LinkedIn: Because
I think they're fearful of
retaliation. And

35:55.887 --> 36:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has shown that he will
essentially attack
individuals, make Second
Amendment jokes,

36:01.793 --> 36:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
et cetera, and they're worried
that this will
be bad for their businesses and
bad for them.

36:06.865 --> 36:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hoffman, who made
his billions
founding LinkedIn, running
PayPal and investing

36:11.770 --> 36:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early in Facebook and Airbnb, is
outspokenly
anti-Trump. And he's putting his
money where

36:18.176 --> 36:19.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his mouth is.

36:20.011 --> 36:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month on the Web site
Crowdpac, he pledged
$5 million to veterans charities
if Donald

36:26.751 --> 36:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump would release his tax
returns. He has
also bankrolled a game, "Trumped
Up Cards."

36:33.691 --> 36:36.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the fastest way to make
America great
again?

36:36.861 --> 36:37.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Suing the Constitution.

36:37.962 --> 36:39.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Suing the
Constitution?

36:39.864 --> 36:40.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:40.865 --> 36:42.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Fat-shaming Miss Universe.

36:42.667 --> 36:47.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's the popular
parlor game
"Cards Against Humanity" with a
snarky Trump

36:47.338 --> 36:49.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
twist.

36:49.107 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While building Trump Tower, 200
undocumented
Polish immigrants were paid $5
an hour to

36:53.978 --> 36:55.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
destroy what?

36:55.046 --> 36:56.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Tamper-proof I.D. cards.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Tamper-proof I.D.
cards.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Make America great again
sombreros.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:04.022 --> 37:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: It's meant to be
informative
and to enable discourse more
than anything

37:08.126 --> 37:09.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it also mocks
Trump mercilessly,
prompting this question from
Daily Show host

37:13.698 --> 37:15.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trevor Noah.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH, Host, "The Daily
Show With Trevor
Noah": Why? Why would you do
this?

37:16.434 --> 37:17.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: Well...

37:17.869 --> 37:18.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TREVOR NOAH: Because you
realize, if he becomes
president, you're dead.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:20.105 --> 37:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: It's a little bit
actually inspired
by your show and...

37:24.275 --> 37:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: Oh, don't involve
me. No, no,
no.

37:26.911 --> 37:27.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:27.912 --> 37:28.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: Hey.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TREVOR NOAH: No, no, no.

37:30.815 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hoffman gets why
others are Trump-mum
and especially why fellow
business leaders

37:34.152 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't sharing what they confide
to him in
private.

37:36.821 --> 37:40.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: People are
legitimately worried,
almost like a schoolyard bully,
if I step

37:40.625 --> 37:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, am I going to be targeted,
too?

37:42.093 --> 37:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And so what you're
doing now
is taking on the bully?

37:46.898 --> 37:51.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: Yes,
unfortunately. I really
wish I didn't have to. I wish to
be focused

37:51.469 --> 37:55.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on kind of the business stuff
I'm doing, how
do I contribute to our economic
progress,

37:55.206 --> 38:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how do I help create a future
for American
industry, American middle class,
these kind

38:00.211 --> 38:02.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of things.

38:02.046 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those things actually really
matter to me.
But it's so critical now that
I'm taking every

38:05.083 --> 38:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
available hour and making more
hours than
I have available in order to get
out and speak

38:09.354 --> 38:11.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this topic.

38:11.222 --> 38:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you yourself,
when you were
at boarding school, had
encounters with bullies,

38:16.961 --> 38:18.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

38:18.830 --> 38:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: For the first
year, I basically
tried to reason with them. I
tried to say,

38:21.599 --> 38:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, is this really what you
want to be doing?
Don't we aspire to be something
more?

38:26.538 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, none of that talk
worked. And the
next year, I showed back up and
I basically

38:31.276 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, OK, here's how it's going
to play. Anything
you do to me, I'm going to do 2X
back to you.

38:36.881 --> 38:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You damage things in my room,
I'm going to
trash your room. You threaten
me, I'm going

38:41.119 --> 38:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to threaten you. That's the new
law of the
land.

38:43.354 --> 38:50.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, basically, I was so
convincing that nothing
happened for the rest of the
year. I think

38:50.328 --> 38:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the boarding schools are like
miniature versions
of "Lord of the Flies."

38:53.364 --> 38:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But don't we all
have a savage
side? And isn't Silicon Valley a
case study

38:59.003 --> 39:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the survival of the fittest?

39:01.739 --> 39:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're in an environment where
lots of people
believe that the way we move
forward, every

39:09.113 --> 39:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person pursues his or her
self-interest in
a libertarian way, a free way,
and we're all

39:15.987 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ultimately better off.

39:17.889 --> 39:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: One of the great
strengths of
American culture is this
empowerment of individual,

39:23.728 --> 39:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the individual being able to
be entrepreneurial,
create new things.

39:27.232 --> 39:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you create a whole group of
people to
make great companies. It's
employees and investors

39:31.836 --> 39:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and customers and partners. The
fabric of
society, of a network of
relations, is key

39:38.243 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to being successful.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And we are all then
linked in
to...

39:41.813 --> 39:43.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: Exactly.

39:43.615 --> 39:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's part of the reason
why we also
need to focus on, how do I give
to society,

39:46.851 --> 39:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how do I participate in society,
how do I
make society a better place,
because, by the

39:51.489 --> 39:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, it's good for me, but it's
also good
for all of us in the environment
in which

39:54.125 --> 39:55.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we live and work.

39:55.827 --> 39:59.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: There is an
opposing view in
the Valley, however, trumpeted
by Hoffman's

39:59.364 --> 40:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longtime libertarian pal Peter
Thiel, fellow
member of the so-called PayPal
mafia and a

40:06.104 --> 40:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump delegate who spoke
at the Republican
National Convention.

40:10.074 --> 40:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER THIEL, Entrepreneur: Our
economy is
broken. If you're watching me
right now, you

40:16.114 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand this better than any
politician
in Washington, D.C. I'm not a
politician,

40:23.454 --> 40:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but neither is Donald Trump. He
is a builder,
and it's time to rebuild
America.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:30.628 --> 40:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The appeal of
Donald Trump to
people like your friend Peter
Thiel and former

40:35.667 --> 40:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partner is that things in our
democracy are
broken, gridlocked. We need
somebody strong

40:43.174 --> 40:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come in, break it up, and be
the ultimate
change agent, and that's what
Donald Trump

40:48.746 --> 40:50.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
represents.

40:50.548 --> 40:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: What I think he
imagines is
that Trump has a policy, that
Trump has an

40:53.851 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
idea of what to do.

40:55.720 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I haven't heard any of those
ideas. All I
hear is sloganeering, vitriol,
personal attacks.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not how you solve this
problem. How
you solve this problem is say,
OK, how do

41:05.997 --> 41:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we essentially return to being a
nation of
builders, how do we strengthen
the educational

41:11.536 --> 41:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, inclusion of the middle
class?

41:13.571 --> 41:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What would happen
to the United
States' economy in general and
Silicon Valley's

41:19.177 --> 41:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy in particular if Donald
Trump were
to become president, in your
view?

41:23.581 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: I think the
randomness by Donald
Trump's governing, by tweeting,
sloganeering,

41:29.320 --> 41:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacking, will create great
chaos in the
entire market. I think people
will have difficulties

41:33.491 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in predicting the future. I
think capital
will recede.

41:37.362 --> 41:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have made a huge amount of
progress over
the last 50 years by enabling
trade, by enabling

41:42.367 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of collaboration and
learning. And actually,
in fact, when you look at your
average 30-year-old

41:46.504 --> 41:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, they're much better off
than a 30-year-old
20 years ago, 30 years ago,
because of progress

41:51.843 --> 41:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in technology and health care
and all the
rest of this.

41:54.178 --> 42:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what about all
the people
who are demonstrably left
behind, who are

42:01.219 --> 42:06.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hurt by trade, hurt by
globalization, hurt
by the progress of technology?

42:06.824 --> 42:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: So, I actually
think we need
to put our energies, as
entrepreneurs, as

42:10.862 --> 42:14.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
technology inventors, as
government, to being
much more inclusive.

42:14.132 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the key thing is
actually working
together.

42:15.933 --> 42:21.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, but the
argument is, we
can't go on as we are, and there
seem to be

42:21.506 --> 42:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of people who think that,
right?

42:23.341 --> 42:25.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID HOFFMAN: Yes.

42:25.176 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And so we have with
to blow it
up or break it down or do
something different

42:32.383 --> 42:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the way things have been
done up until
now.

42:34.352 --> 42:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: Yes. And so, at
Silicon Valley,
I'm extremely sympathetic to the
revolutionary

42:38.589 --> 42:43.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response. I not only agree with
it emotionally.
I agree with it practically.

42:43.361 --> 42:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only thing I disagree
with is, I don't
think Trump is that. Trump is
blow it up for

42:47.732 --> 42:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no good reason at all. You want
to actually
do revolution with a target,
with an idea,

42:52.770 --> 42:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with building a new system.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Aren't there a lot
of people
here in Silicon Valley who don't
believe in

42:57.108 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
democracy at all anymore at this
point?

42:58.976 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID HOFFMAN: Democracy tends to
be a collaborative
process, a committee, a
consensus.

43:04.248 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Silicon Valley tends to believe
in the individual
who creates a small group and
does something

43:08.052 --> 43:13.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
big. Democracy is always
frustrating, but
it creates a society that, for
example, allows

43:13.624 --> 43:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us to invest in each other's
kids, to have
public education, to have both a
greater society

43:19.730 --> 43:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and individual freedom for
creating businesses.

43:22.400 --> 43:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think there are people who
go, oh, this
is all broken, you should throw
it all out.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's unwise.

43:28.906 --> 43:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How does Trump, or
Mr. Trump,
plan to restore -- quote -- "a
sense of dignity

43:34.245 --> 43:35.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the White House"?

43:35.246 --> 43:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Topless horse rides with
Vladimir Putin.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:39.450 --> 43:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, as the tag line
of "Trumped
Up Cards" puts it: "This is a
game. Democracy

43:44.255 --> 43:45.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
isn't."

43:45.990 --> 43:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting from

43:50.194 --> 43:52.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Menlo Park, California.

43:52.063 --> 43:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow,
Paul will talk
to investor Tom Barrack. He is
one of Donald

43:57.869 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's economic advisers.

43:59.470 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LLOYD BENTSEN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Senator, you are no Jack
Kennedy.

44:03.107 --> 44:05.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALDINE FERRARO (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I almost resent, Vice President
Bush, your

44:05.109 --> 44:06.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patronizing...

44:06.544 --> 44:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Presidential
Candidate: Whole
binders full of women.

44:08.379 --> 44:09.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That I have opposed the death
penalty during

44:09.647 --> 44:11.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of my life.

44:11.482 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Interact with all the
general election
debates on our Web site,
watchthedebates.org.

44:15.953 --> 44:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was by far the
most unusual
Nobel award in recent times. Bob
Dylan was

44:24.061 --> 44:28.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given the prize in literature
today. He's
long been considered a legend
for his work

44:28.633 --> 44:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and lyrics in folk and rock
music.

44:31.169 --> 44:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, his work was recognized
for its poetry.

44:34.672 --> 44:40.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has an
appreciation and more
on that decision.

44:40.044 --> 44:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He led a folk
revival in the
early 1960s, took it into new
and epoch-making

44:54.692 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
territory through his use of
language and
imagery, famously went electric
at the Newport

45:06.737 --> 45:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Folk Festival in 1965, and, for
decades since,
to this day, has continued to
perform, record,

45:16.581 --> 45:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impress and sometimes confound
millions of
fans worldwide.

45:21.619 --> 45:26.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By any measure, Bob Dylan is one
of the most
important and influential
popular songwriters

45:26.123 --> 45:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his era, and now he is also a
Nobel laureate
in literature. The announcement
came this

45:32.363 --> 45:34.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
morning in Stockholm.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA DANIUS, Permanent Secretary
of the Swedish
Academy: The Nobel Prize in
Literature for

45:36.500 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 is awarded to Bob Dylan for
having created
new poetic expressions within
the great American

45:45.843 --> 45:47.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
song tradition.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Though his name
had been fancifully
raised for the Nobel in recent
years, the

45:50.815 --> 45:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice still came as a surprise,
and his selection
ends a long drought for
Americans. The last

45:56.687 --> 46:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was novelist Toni Morrison in
1993.

46:00.858 --> 46:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dylan was born Robert Zimmerman
in Duluth,
Minnesota, in 1941. He changed
his name and

46:06.130 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came to New York's Greenwich
Village in 1961.
And his debut album came a year
later. He

46:11.402 --> 46:15.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gives few interviews and doesn't
talk much
about his writing. But he did
speak in Martin

46:15.740 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scorsese's 2005 documentary on
"American Masters,"
"No Direction Home."

46:20.745 --> 46:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB DYLAN, Musician: Words have
their own
meaning, or they have different
meanings.

46:24.649 --> 46:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then all -- and words change
their meaning.
Words that were -- meant
something 10 years

46:28.819 --> 46:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago don't mean that now. They
mean something
else.

46:30.554 --> 46:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he said this
about the
life of an artist:

46:33.157 --> 46:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB DYLAN: An artist has got to
be careful
never really to arrive at a
place where he

46:37.161 --> 46:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinks he's at somewhere. You
always have
to realize that you're
constantly in the state

46:41.699 --> 46:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of becoming, you know? And as
long as you
can stay in that realm, you will
sort of be

46:47.738 --> 46:48.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all right.

46:48.739 --> 46:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Other musicians
were listening.

46:50.508 --> 46:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TAYLOR, Musician: It felt
as though
it was a voice from a new world
and that we

46:58.683 --> 47:00.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were part of it.

47:00.518 --> 47:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This afternoon,
another great
songwriter, James Taylor, told
me via Skype

47:04.455 --> 47:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the influence Dylan had on
him and others.

47:06.757 --> 47:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TAYLOR: It was the musical
form that
you could approach and you could
try it on

47:11.195 --> 47:15.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for yourself. And that's sort of
what folk
music was about.

47:15.266 --> 47:20.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he kept changing it up.
You know,
he throwing you a curve. He kept
us guessing.

47:21.005 --> 47:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it does engage you on many
different levels.
So, there is a sort of deceptive
simplicity

47:28.079 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, an availability,
approachability.
And then there is just the depth
of the stuff

47:34.318 --> 47:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as -- lyrically, which is really
what is being
acknowledged in this Nobel
Prize.

47:41.859 --> 47:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's -- it's a big deal.
It's huge.

47:45.696 --> 47:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Hajdu,
author of the
books "Positively Fourth Street"
and the brand-new

47:50.434 --> 47:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Love For Sale: Pop Music in
America," says
Dylan contains multitudes.

47:54.905 --> 47:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HAJDU, Author, "Positively
Fourth Street":
Most of the history of American
popular music

47:57.742 --> 48:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is contained in his work, from
the blues,
through country, to early rock
'n' roll, including

48:03.481 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gospel, because he drew really
freely, liberally,
from all those traditions, and
also from other

48:10.855 --> 48:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traditions, from literary
traditions, from
poetry, from other novels, and
pulled it all

48:17.528 --> 48:20.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together to make this very
creative, original
stew.

48:20.498 --> 48:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among many
honors, Dylan was
inducted into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame

48:24.635 --> 48:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1988, and was awarded the
Presidential
Medal of Freedom in 2012.

48:29.273 --> 48:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today, everybody from Bruce
Springsteen to

48:32.643 --> 48:41.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude.
There is
not a bigger giant in the
history of American

48:41.318 --> 48:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music. All these years later,
he's still chasing
that sound, still searching for
a little bit

48:48.292 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of truth. And I have to say that
I am a really
big fan.

48:52.096 --> 48:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Still, a
songwriter as Nobel
laureate for literature?

48:56.267 --> 49:02.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, novelist Gary Shteyngart
poked fun,
tweeting: "I totally get the
Nobel Committee.

49:02.606 --> 49:08.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reading books is hard," while
Salman Rushdie
wrote, "From Orpheus to Faiz,
song &amp; poetry

49:08.813 --> 49:15.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been closely linked. Dylan
is the brilliant
inheritor of the bardic
tradition. Great choice."

49:15.486 --> 49:17.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Taylor has no doubt at
all.

49:17.254 --> 49:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TAYLOR: I think it was
world-changing
stuff, or at least it chronicled
the world

49:22.827 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it changed. It helps you
navigate and negotiate
the world. And I think so many
of his songs

49:31.235 --> 49:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were so important that way.

49:35.840 --> 49:41.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's entirely
appropriate that he
get the Nobel Prize for
Literature.

49:41.946 --> 49:44.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Music writer
David Hajdu adds
this:

49:44.515 --> 49:48.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HAJDU: In a way, the Nobel
is a validation
Bob Dylan is a validation of a
whole kind

49:48.786 --> 49:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of literature that is different
from words
on the page.

49:51.722 --> 49:58.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think his singing is
inseparable from
the kind of art that he made,
his nobby, gnarly

49:58.963 --> 50:05.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
singing, the irascibility of his
presentation,
his persona, the convoluted,
complicated,

50:05.536 --> 50:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poetic lyrics and hard-driving
music. All
that came together to make a
unique kind of

50:11.575 --> 50:15.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
art that we could see as
literature now.

50:15.179 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A Nobel Prize,
and still on
the road. Bob Dylan was silent
about the prize

50:24.088 --> 50:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today. But, tonight, he performs
in Las Vegas,
continuing a national tour.

50:29.126 --> 50:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

50:57.054 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from author
Rumaan Alam.
He speaks to us about family as
an experiment.

51:02.493 --> 51:04.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alam's latest book is called
"Rich and Pretty."

51:04.795 --> 51:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUMAAN ALAM, Author, "Rich and
Pretty": Subtlety
doesn't work for children. And
anybody who

51:09.767 --> 51:12.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is raising a child is going to
nod their head
when they hear that.

Your task as a parent is to
repeat and repeat
and repeat yourself, to really
inculcate in

51:18.943 --> 51:24.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your child your own -- the
values you want
them to hold.

I met my husband on the world's
most successful
blind date. We got married in
the parking

51:34.024 --> 51:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of the Santa Cruz City Hall.
And it was
much more romantic than it
sounds. A year

51:39.196 --> 51:44.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or so after we were married
legally, we became
parents.

51:44.268 --> 51:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I exist within a nuclear family
where there
are no women. It is incumbent on
my husband

51:49.840 --> 51:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I to raise our boys with an
understanding
of the 50 percent of the planet
who are different

51:55.846 --> 51:57.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from -- they are.

51:57.648 --> 52:02.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am conscious of people looking
at our family
in a different way, and I don't
blame them

52:02.286 --> 52:07.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that. A brown man and a
white man with
two little black boys is going
to attract

52:07.591 --> 52:12.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looks, especially because
they're the two
best looking children on the
planet.

52:12.262 --> 52:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The family that we have built
for ourselves
requires a kind of radical
honesty. We have

52:16.667 --> 52:20.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no choice but to level with
them, because
children figure out remarkably
early that

52:21.005 --> 52:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
babies grows in a lady's tummy.

52:22.906 --> 52:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The choice that a mother makes
to place her
child for adoption is a very
loving and parental

52:30.414 --> 52:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice. I'm conscious of the
fact that there
will times that that is
something my children

52:34.818 --> 52:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mourn. And that's OK with me,
because that's
how life works.

52:39.923 --> 52:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While many families may look
like they adhere
to the archetype of mom and dad
and 2.4 kids

52:45.929 --> 52:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a dog, within that structure
of the family,
there's always something that
makes you your

52:51.435 --> 52:57.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own. And if we all recognize
that, I think
we would be a little better off.

52:57.941 --> 53:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few years ago, I was flying
out of Florida.
I had my oldest son in my arms.
And the TSA

53:03.013 --> 53:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agent says to my baby, "Oh, it's
OK. We just
need to check your daddy's hands
for gunpowder."

53:09.119 --> 53:14.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 2-year-old doesn't know what
gunpowder is.
I thought, well, if I was a
red-headed potter

53:14.958 --> 53:19.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
holding this baby, would he want
to check
my hands for gunpowder?

53:19.430 --> 53:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am conscious of the fact that
I have many,
many advantages. We are
middle-class people.

53:25.402 --> 53:31.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are insulated and protect by
those things.
But we are different. And we
still live in

53:31.341 --> 53:33.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a society that is still very
suspicious of
difference.
