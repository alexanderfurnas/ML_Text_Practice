JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: the
investigation into Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

00:05.166 --> 00:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, the Senate Judiciary
Committee rescinded its subpoena
for former Trump campaign

00:10.900 --> 00:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
manager Paul Manafort.

00:12.633 --> 00:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Negotiations continue on
when and how he will testify.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Earlier, it was round
two for Jared Kushner.

00:20.033 --> 00:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son-in-law and
senior adviser answered more
questions on Capitol Hill about

00:26.666 --> 00:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his interactions with
Russian officials during
the campaign and beyond.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Yesterday, Kushner released
an 11-page document
detailing several meetings

00:36.233 --> 00:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had with Russian citizens
and officials while working on
his father-in-law's campaign

00:40.800 --> 00:43.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and transition.

00:43.433 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kushner said there was
absolutely no collusion
and no improper contacts,
even though he initially

00:48.533 --> 00:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
failed to disclose these
meetings, as required by law.

00:50.633 --> 00:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on this, we talk with
two lawmakers who questioned
Kushner today in that closed

00:54.700 --> 00:56.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, earlier today, I spoke
with Republican Congressman
Chris Stewart of Utah, who's on

01:00.100 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the House Intelligence
Committee.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked him what questions he
had going into today's meeting.

01:04.266 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS STEWART (R), Utah: You
know, we wanted to know some
of the details about obviously

01:08.466 --> 01:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his meetings with some of the
people associated with Russia
and who set up those meetings,

01:14.100 --> 01:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what he knew about those
meetings, what came
out of those meetings.

01:16.100 --> 01:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to tell you, though, that
for those who are hoping and
looking for the impeachment

01:21.866 --> 01:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Donald Trump, Jared
Kushner is not that guy.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he's not going to
carry that narrative chord.

01:26.533 --> 01:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's very sincere, very honest,
and he just didn't have much
to add to this story in those

01:33.200 --> 01:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are looking for
evidence of collusion.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One
of the issues that I
know came up yesterday,
and I'm assuming today,

01:39.233 --> 01:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was his federal disclosure
form, where he, as an incoming
member of the administration,

01:43.266 --> 01:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is supposed to disclose all
these meetings he may have
had with foreign officials.

01:47.666 --> 01:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And apparently he had to
update that document three
different times, saying
he forgot initially.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He chalked it up yesterday to
something of a rookie mistake.

01:56.533 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did your questions to him today
assuage any doubts you might
have about that particular

02:01.433 --> 02:02.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue?

02:02.433 --> 02:04.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes, you
know, that was one things
we did want to talk about.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it really was
answered I think to all
of our satisfaction.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's really very simple.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The SF-86 is a very
complicated document.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had to do one as
an Air Force pilot.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You go back 10 years, in
some cases, more than that.

02:16.500 --> 02:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have to provide in
some cases hundreds of
pages of information.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not at all unusual
for someone to update or
to modify that document.

02:25.733 --> 02:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, they expect
that you will.

02:28.100 --> 02:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They expect that, as you kind
of dive into this process,
you're going to remember things.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And in this case, the
explanation was even
more simple than that.

02:35.366 --> 02:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was more than it is
a complicated document.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was that they admit that
they filed that document by
mistake and didn't have some of

02:43.833 --> 02:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this information on.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But they recognized that
immediately, and within
a day had updated it.

02:48.966 --> 02:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it wasn't just
Russian officials that
they didn't include.

02:51.966 --> 02:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were officials with
-- or meetings with King
Abdullah, a meeting with
some other -- Benjamin

02:58.433 --> 03:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Netanyahu, people that they
clearly would have remembered.

03:00.566 --> 03:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just didn't have it on that
form, recognized that error,
and, I would say within 24 hours

03:05.533 --> 03:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had already corrected it.

03:07.566 --> 03:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is
also a question about whether
Kushner had participated in

03:10.533 --> 03:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or asked the Russian ambassador
to help set up this back-channel
line of communications

03:16.733 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Russians.

03:18.733 --> 03:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you talk with him
about that today, and what
did he say about that?

03:20.166 --> 03:22.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes, our
conclusion is that he
didn't intend for there
to be any back-channel

03:24.400 --> 03:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
communications.

03:26.933 --> 03:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just to facilitate
what they thought was
one conversation that
some Russian officials

03:32.366 --> 03:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to have about, you know,
developing relationships with
the incoming administration.

03:37.533 --> 03:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't have any secure
phones, and so they just simply
asked, do you have a secure

03:40.133 --> 03:42.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phone?

03:42.166 --> 03:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That conversation didn't take
place, and that was really kind
of the beginning and end of

03:46.600 --> 03:48.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it is one of those things
where you do wonder when you
hear about this and you read

03:50.666 --> 03:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the press reports, but then
when you actually have a chance
to talk to the witness, you

03:54.400 --> 03:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
realize, again, there is a
very reasonable explanation for
it, and there isn't much more

04:00.100 --> 04:02.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pursue.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of your
colleagues and some others
have said that, given the

04:04.066 --> 04:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions swirling around
Kushner, that he shouldn't have
a security clearance to see

04:08.366 --> 04:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
top-secret national
security information.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that that's
-- do you think he should
lose his privileges?

04:13.500 --> 04:14.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: No, I
just think that's nuts.

04:16.766 --> 04:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, if he's this done
something wrong and if
someone has evidence
that he did something

04:19.166 --> 04:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong and that we can actually
say, OK, that's a security
violation or a security concern,

04:25.333 --> 04:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then, well, let's
deal with that.

04:27.366 --> 04:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if your only objection
to him is saying that he had
to add additional information

04:31.066 --> 04:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to this form that they
requested, then I just
think it's inappropriate
for someone to say

04:35.866 --> 04:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that that would preclude
him from holding a
security clearance.

04:38.433 --> 04:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly,
Congressman, just shifting
gears a tiny bit, the president,

04:42.233 --> 04:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as you know, has been
quite tough recently on
his attorney general.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just curious
for your take on that.

04:48.233 --> 04:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a member of his own party,
what does that atmosphere do
to this ongoing investigation?

04:53.366 --> 04:54.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:54.366 --> 04:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes.

04:56.866 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I support our
president and I defend
him when it's appropriate
when I think that

04:59.366 --> 05:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's being, you know, unfairly
attacked or criticized.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, on the other hand,
there are times when
I disagree with him.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is one of those times.

05:06.566 --> 05:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the attorney general
is one of the most honorable,
sincere men in government.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's certainly been my
interactions with him.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you see him testify
and others, I think most
American people feel that that

05:16.300 --> 05:18.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I don't -- just
don't understand why he
wouldn't and I, in fact,
expect that he should

05:23.466 --> 05:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue as our
attorney general.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Congressman Chris Stewart, thank
you very much for being here.

05:26.666 --> 05:27.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:27.933 --> 05:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: All
right, thank you.
