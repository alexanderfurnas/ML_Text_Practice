TRYING TO HIT OR WHO?           
>> YEAH, THE HAMAS STRATEGY HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN THE ROCKETS THAT

ALWAYS BEEN THE ROCKETS THAT

24:06.956 --> 24:07.418
ALWAYS BEEN THE ROCKETS THAT    
THEY USE ARE NOT GUIDED         
MISSILES.                       

24:07.420 --> 24:08.880
THEY USE ARE NOT GUIDED         
MISSILES.                       
THEY'RE VERY INACCURATE AND THEY

24:08.882 --> 24:10.905
MISSILES.                       
THEY'RE VERY INACCURATE AND THEY
JUST FIRE THEM AND WHEREVER THEY

24:10.907 --> 24:12.000
THEY'RE VERY INACCURATE AND THEY
JUST FIRE THEM AND WHEREVER THEY
LAND, THEY LAND.                

24:12.002 --> 24:14.789
JUST FIRE THEM AND WHEREVER THEY
LAND, THEY LAND.
