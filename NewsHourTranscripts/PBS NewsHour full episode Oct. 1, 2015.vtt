AARON SCOTT, Oregon Public Broad
spoke with a number of students

03:24.738 --> 03:33.280
at the school, as well as teache
gone through the lockdown, that

at the bookstore or in the kind

03:44.458 --> 03:44.191
back closet.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.296
But I also spoke with a number o
who were in the classroom right

03:50.764 --> 03:51.465
to the shooting who retold the s
an initial loud sound next door,

"Run, run," and everybody kind o

04:03.743 --> 04:06.346
from that building and went to f
wherever they could find it.

04:07.814 --> 04:11.017
I mean, I spoke with one student
just behind a large green kind o

04:12.486 --> 04:15.622
transformer, and then a couple o
ran to the bookstore and were ab

04:16.256 --> 04:16.556
in that stockroom.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.391
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.329
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did any of them g

JUDY WOODRUFF: How were they cop

04:39.913 --> 04:43.083
AARON SCOTT: They -- nerves were
strained.

04:44.551 --> 04:52.359
I mean, people, I think, were in
a state of shock, and most of th

04:53.827 --> 04:59.366
by family and friends and gettin
support from people who loved th

05:00.834 --> 05:06.640
mean, I spoke of the student who
bookstore, said that they kind o

05:08.108 --> 05:17.584
were there for a number of minut
were waiting for the police to c

05:19.052 --> 05:19.986
was this kind of horrifying nerv
thinking, this happens elsewhere

05:20.687 --> 05:20.754
happen at our school.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.392
But it wasn't until the police a
that they broke down really cryi

05:26.860 --> 05:31.398
of what happened, but then they
each other in a group hug, reali

05:32.399 --> 05:36.803
we have survived this and we hav
it.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.140
So, it's mixed. I mean, there's
people who are dealing with real

05:41.608 --> 05:46.313
then some people who are feeling
were blessed that they got throu

05:46.746 --> 05:46.746

JUDY WOODRUFF: School and colleg
across the country are grappling

06:00.860 --> 06:02.329
to prevent attacks like this one

06:03.797 --> 06:08.335
I'm joined now by Daniel Carter.
of the VTV Family Outreach Found

of the mass shooting at Virginia

06:15.709 --> 06:19.279
in 2007. He leads that group's 3
Campus Safety Initiative.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.515
Daniel Carter, thank you for bei

Your connection is that you advi
of the victims of Virginia Tech,

06:30.490 --> 06:36.263
2007, 32 students -- people died
what, 17 others wounded. This mu

06:36.997 --> 06:37.564
awfully familiar to you.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.066
S. DANIEL CARTER, Director, VTV
Foundation: It's an all-too-comm

06:41.301 --> 06:43.370
and our thoughts and prayers are
of those affected.

06:44.838 --> 06:50.477
And, you know, we were created t
and respond to these types of cr

06:51.945 --> 06:55.782
So, our goal with the 32 Nationa
Initiative is to empower college

06:57.217 --> 06:58.918
to be better equipped to prevent
to these types of situations.

07:00.387 --> 07:04.291
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are colleges
doing across the country now tha

07:05.091 --> 07:05.525
doing before Virginia Tech?

07:06.993 --> 07:08.862
S. DANIEL CARTER: The two bigges
involve multidisciplinary threat

07:10.330 --> 07:13.800
teams, where if someone is of co
can be reported and assessed by

07:14.934 --> 07:16.369
professionals, law enforcement p
for example.

07:17.837 --> 07:22.208
And, also, you have emergency ma
where you have emergency notific

07:23.677 --> 07:27.580
and you have a rapid response by
And that's one of the keys is, t

07:29.049 --> 07:31.951
to be connectivity between campu
and small, and if they don't hav

07:33.420 --> 07:36.523
law enforcement, connectivity wi
enforcement, so that their secur

07:37.724 --> 07:38.825
are routinely drilled and traine
law enforcement.

07:40.293 --> 07:46.166
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are there a unifo
questions that college officials

07:47.634 --> 07:52.072
and even students are to think a
assess the people around them to

07:52.872 --> 07:53.540
who is a risk and who isn't?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.443
S. DANIEL CARTER: Well, I think
gut.

07:57.911 --> 08:02.349
That goes all too uncommon -- it
often dismissed. But trust your

08:03.483 --> 08:05.785
whether or not the college has a
report that.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.523
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if someone is
I mean, is it as simple as that?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.793
S. DANIEL CARTER: If you see som
something. It may sound MDNMho

08:14.527 --> 08:16.162
it is as simple as that.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.032
And you can report it to the aut
they should take a look at it.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.837
JUDY WOODRUFF: How many schools
the kind of directions that you

08:25.305 --> 08:28.274
S. DANIEL CARTER: Most large --
residential colleges and univers

08:29.509 --> 08:32.379
adopted the threat assessment an
management models.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.883
We are just now beginning to exp
colleges, so I don't know how ma

08:38.351 --> 08:40.720
are, but I know that they have a
protocol which was followed and

08:41.821 --> 08:42.922
emergency identification protoco
followed.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.894
JUDY WOODRUFF: What more, Daniel
you think needs to be done to pr

08:48.762 --> 08:49.396
kinds of awful things from happe

08:50.864 --> 08:53.500
S. DANIEL CARTER: I think we nee
better job of making sure threat

08:54.968 --> 08:58.438
teams are established on every c
country, that they're well-publi

08:59.906 --> 09:02.876
that colleges and universities h
response procedures in place, an

09:03.743 --> 09:04.144
partner with local first-respond

09:16.623 --> 09:17.924
JUDY WOODRUFF: So it is an ongoi

09:19.392 --> 09:20.460
S. DANIEL CARTER: It is. We have

09:21.060 --> 09:21.294
long way to go.

I'm not going to get into exactl

20:57.189 --> 21:00.993
hit, but we don't believe that t
ISIL targets. So, that's a probl

21:02.461 --> 21:06.499
I mean, the Russians have said t
going to do one thing, and here

21:07.333 --> 21:07.800
something different than that.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.536
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign M
it looks like a terrorist, if it

21:12.004 --> 21:14.173
a terrorist, if it walks like a
if it fights like a terrorist, i

21:14.607 --> 21:14.440
right?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.978
MARGARET WARNER: In turn, Russia
minister, Sergei Lavrov, at the

21:20.412 --> 21:22.581
appeared to acknowledge the atta
limited to the Islamic State.

21:24.049 --> 21:28.521
SERGEI LAVROV: We always were sa
we are going to fight ISIL and o

21:29.989 --> 21:35.528
groups. This is the same -- the
which the Americans are taking.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.331
our position as well. We see eye
the coalition on this one.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.602
MARGARET WARNER: In fact, Russia
military officials spoke by tele

21:45.070 --> 21:49.408
today for the first time since t
airstrikes began, in a bid to de

21:50.075 --> 21:51.243
airspace over Syria.

21:52.711 --> 21:56.115
With both Russian and American f
active there, a Pentagon spokesm

21:57.583 --> 22:03.489
need to avoid miscalculation. An
focus on the air war, Reuters re

22:04.523 --> 22:07.459
has now sent ground troops into
Assad.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.931
Meanwhile, Moscow said it would
in Iraq as well.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.969
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-A
the "NewsHour" Wednesday that he

22:18.204 --> 22:20.773
Russian involvement, if needed,
the Islamic State.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.275
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret join

22:24.743 --> 22:27.046
Margaret, you have been reportin
all day long. What have you lear

22:28.447 --> 22:30.216
what happened during this teleco
U.S. and Russian officials?

22:31.684 --> 22:33.452
MARGARET WARNER: Well, I think t
thing, Judy, this went about an

22:34.920 --> 22:38.591
two teams were, as I said, by te
led by someone from the Defense

22:40.059 --> 22:42.161
and someone from the Joint Chief
counterparts on the other side,

22:42.861 --> 22:43.562
was highly technical.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.601
And they described it as cordial
but highly technical. And I mean

22:50.069 --> 22:55.074
tiny -- focused on pilot safety.
if one aircraft spots another, a

22:56.542 --> 23:01.180
American, how do they communicat
first? What language do they use

23:02.381 --> 23:04.450
do they use? I mean, it was real
stuff like that.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.955
The U.S. did make its case about
be focusing on ISIS targets, not

23:11.423 --> 23:14.627
moderates or whatever, but there
on that level. It was really, re

23:16.095 --> 23:18.897
And when -- each side presented
to the other and they agreed the

23:19.765 --> 23:21.900
consult their bosses and hopeful

23:23.369 --> 23:26.705
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we keep heari
deconfliction. What does that re

23:28.173 --> 23:30.109
MARGARET WARNER: I was told by o
general today that that's not ev

23:30.709 --> 23:31.810
a military term.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.782
On its simplest level, it means,
how do you prevent an accidental

23:38.250 --> 23:44.156
So, it would be issues such as w
discussing today. But at a deepe

23:45.624 --> 23:52.731
means, how do we -- let's say we
that you bomb your bad guys, we

23:54.199 --> 23:56.702
guys, we're not under one comman
is something cooperative there a

23:57.503 --> 23:58.937
a channel of communication?

24:00.406 --> 24:03.075
The problem in Syria is -- and t
been cases like that -- the prob

24:04.543 --> 24:10.849
is that if on the list of the Ru
guys, that is, are moderate oppo

24:12.318 --> 24:17.289
that we have trained and support
even armed, then what do we do?

24:18.757 --> 24:21.360
talks today didn't get to that l
that's going to be really the nu

24:22.828 --> 24:27.333
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the U.S. has s
pretty consistently over the las

24:28.801 --> 24:33.572
that they -- that the Russians a
these moderate anti-Assad rebel

24:34.406 --> 24:35.174
do they know that's happening?

24:36.642 --> 24:39.445
MARGARET WARNER: That's a very i
question, Judy, because, at firs

24:40.746 --> 24:43.015
all very clear, but apparently i
clear that they were.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.619
It's clear they weren't hitting
by the Islamic State. This is de

24:49.088 --> 24:52.725
area that's been dominated by th
Free Syrian Army and the moderat

24:54.193 --> 25:00.866
But we had an interesting text m
today by an activist outside the

25:02.267 --> 25:05.704
who said that actually today it
civilians that were killed.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.609
And he gave terrible, terrible s
hitting a bread line with all th

25:11.477 --> 25:13.679
killed. Some of it, we put in ou

25:14.346 --> 25:14.380
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.450
MARGARET WARNER: ... that in fac
when the Pentagon is being caref

25:19.918 --> 25:23.255
look, we can't do damage assessm
ground. We don't have eyes and e

25:24.723 --> 25:28.327
ground. And that's why they're b
in saying that the targets were

25:28.861 --> 25:29.628
opposition.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.497
But it clearly wasn't ISIS.

25:32.965 --> 25:36.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very -- in just a
a few seconds, what do you look

25:38.137 --> 25:39.872
MARGARET WARNER: I'm told that,
are going to be another round of

25:41.340 --> 25:43.776
was late today -- and that, in t
I think it's going to get more d

25:44.843 --> 25:45.878
there, if the Russians keep up t
bombing.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.579
JUDY WOODRUFF: Grim.

25:48.414 --> 26:01.894
Margaret Warner, we thank you.

26:03.362 --> 26:07.766
Now we turn to this country's ma
problem, and our ongoing series

26:08.500 --> 26:09.735
on efforts to reform it.

26:11.203 --> 26:15.974
In a rare moment of bipartisan u
Hill today, Republicans and Demo

26:17.443 --> 26:21.914
unveiled joint legislation to cu
number of people locked up in fe

26:22.781 --> 26:24.316
half of whom are drug offenders.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.754
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair
Grassley announced the deal, fla

26:29.521 --> 26:30.255
senators in both parties.

26:31.723 --> 26:35.928
SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
today because of a lot of hard w

26:37.396 --> 26:43.936
strong desire by those of us her
the Senate work. This is truly a

26:45.404 --> 26:51.944
piece of legislation. It's the b
justice reform in a generation.

26:53.145 --> 26:57.549
of a very thoughtful bipartisan
by the Congress.

26:59.017 --> 27:03.388
JUDY WOODRUFF: The deal was year
If passed, it would end the so-c

27:04.857 --> 27:10.095
strikes rule for life sentences
offenders, expand mandatory mini

27:11.563 --> 27:17.536
for some terrorism-related crime
more education and jobs programs

27:18.403 --> 27:20.606
and limit solitary confinement f

27:22.074 --> 27:25.544
We're joined now by two of the m
of the bill, Democratic Senator

27:26.678 --> 27:28.514
of New Jersey and Republican Sen
Lee of Utah.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.116
And we welcome you both.

27:31.884 --> 27:32.885
Senator Lee, to you first.

27:34.353 --> 27:38.156
What are the most important ways
say this legislation changes our

27:38.757 --> 27:39.258
justice system?

27:40.726 --> 27:43.095
SEN. MIKE LEE (R), Utah: You kno
forward to passing this legislat

27:44.329 --> 27:47.332
it fixes some problems with our
sentencing system.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.470
We have got some of our sentence
of the sentences prescribed by f

27:52.938 --> 27:56.108
are plainly excessive in relatio
of the crime. This is resulting

27:57.576 --> 28:01.380
away a lot of people, a lot of s
and uncles and nephews and broth

28:02.848 --> 28:08.020
for years, sometimes decades at
offenses that, in many cases, do

28:08.887 --> 28:10.522
that kind of lengthy incarcerati

28:11.990 --> 28:15.260
This doesn't eliminate minimum m
but it does reform them in a ver

28:15.961 --> 28:16.461
and long overdue way.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.665
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Booker, w
you add to that? What are the mo

28:21.133 --> 28:25.203
changes here? And I know that yo
a long time been involved on dea

28:26.405 --> 28:29.174
what we call the front end of th
justice system.

28:30.042 --> 28:30.609
SEN. CORY BOOKER (D), New Jersey

28:32.077 --> 28:33.845
Well, look, first of all, the gr
about this legislation is, it's

28:35.314 --> 28:39.518
by people on all parts of the po
how our broken our system is, wh

28:40.953 --> 28:44.389
had, since 1980, an 800 percent
our federal prison population.

28:45.857 --> 28:49.394
So this really begins to unwind
pretty significant way, returnin

28:50.862 --> 28:55.000
discretion to judges, making sur
unwind some of those aspects of

28:55.867 --> 28:56.468
minimums that you talked about.

28:57.936 --> 29:01.173
But even as exciting is what hap
that are already behind the bar,

29:02.641 --> 29:06.011
to, through good behavior, throu
in programs and education, to re

29:06.778 --> 29:08.113
time down and be released.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.851
In addition to that, just very e
People don't realize how expensi

29:14.319 --> 29:18.123
hold elderly people who have bee
40-, 50-year sentences and now a

29:19.591 --> 29:22.060
or very ill, the expense of the
This is saying, wait, these folk

29:23.128 --> 29:24.863
little risk. It's something call
release.

29:26.331 --> 29:30.168
And then, for me, just as this m
that we are, to have the aspects

29:31.637 --> 29:33.972
juveniles, from the solitary con
to the understanding that if you

29:35.440 --> 29:40.445
dumb in your teenage years, by t
Mike and my's age decades later,

29:41.913 --> 29:44.916
be still limiting your economic
as we know it does, because peop

29:46.385 --> 29:49.187
confess that for job interviews.
your ability to get loans and al

29:50.656 --> 29:54.359
So, in its totality, this compre
is going to be steps in the righ

29:55.427 --> 29:56.895
after years of going the wrong w
justice.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.699
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Lee, is t
of this that you think is going

30:01.400 --> 30:01.933
make a big difference?

30:03.402 --> 30:05.504
SEN. MIKE LEE: I think one of th
a lot of people are celebrating

30:06.972 --> 30:11.476
that we make retroactive a law p
was several years ago by Congres

30:12.944 --> 30:16.948
the disparity -- the crack to po
disparity from 100-1 down to 18-

30:17.582 --> 30:18.417
that retroactive.

30:19.885 --> 30:22.320
That coupled with the expansion
safety valve provision and the c

30:23.789 --> 30:27.159
a new safety valve provision wil
judges more discretion in more c

30:28.627 --> 30:33.331
the criminal penalty attached to
crime seems excessive, the judge

30:34.499 --> 30:36.201
some discretion, in the case of
drug felonies.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.972
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Lee, just
you, I know that members of both

30:42.441 --> 30:46.578
parties have come together on th
is at the very time when a numbe

30:48.013 --> 30:51.183
candidates for president are tal
getting the tougher on crime.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.686
I'm thinking particularly of Don
How do you explain that?

30:56.154 --> 30:59.091
SEN. MIKE LEE: Well, this bill i
crime. It's tough on crime by ge

31:00.559 --> 31:03.962
on crime. And this is one of the
I'm so pleased that we're able t

31:04.830 --> 31:05.330
together, as Republicans and Dem

31:06.798 --> 31:09.835
This is a very bipartisan piece
We recognize this is one of thes

31:11.303 --> 31:13.572
Judy, that's neither Republican
it's liberal nor conservative. T

31:15.040 --> 31:18.777
an American issue. We can get be
crime when we devote our resourc

31:19.644 --> 31:20.312
that makes them more effective a

31:21.780 --> 31:24.683
SEN. CORY BOOKER: And let me jus
I watched the debates. I saw Ran

31:26.151 --> 31:31.656
Chris Christie and others talk a
talk about sentencing reform, ba

31:33.125 --> 31:36.294
This is nothing new. And Republi
if you look at the governors, Re

31:37.763 --> 31:40.132
have been leading in some ways,
governor of Georgia, for example

31:41.399 --> 31:43.401
lot of things already that we're
in this legislation.

31:44.870 --> 31:47.739
So, this is not a Republican or
issue. I'm sorry. My allies on t

31:49.207 --> 31:52.844
everybody from the Koch brothers
Norquist. This has really been a

31:54.045 --> 31:56.581
coming together of right or left
that are absurd.

31:58.049 --> 32:01.720
If you just heard what Mike Lee
this idea that you could have do

32:03.188 --> 32:07.559
vs. powder cocaine sentencing --
were changed, so people that wer

32:09.027 --> 32:13.165
those laws could be in and out,
they violated them recently, the

32:14.633 --> 32:16.001
out, but somebody who violated t
ago was still sitting in prison.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.172
So, the absurdities in the syste
costing taxpayers a quarter-of-a

32:21.640 --> 32:24.609
dollars a year paying for a brok
when we know, both of us know we

32:26.044 --> 32:29.848
those investments in law enforce
in building roads and bridges.

32:31.316 --> 32:35.220
This is a time -- a bill that ca
from all sectors of our society,

32:36.688 --> 32:40.458
a liberal or conservative. This
for celebrating smart government

32:41.927 --> 32:45.130
to be making sure we keep us saf
up there, I think, that spoke to

32:46.431 --> 32:47.799
about this is a bill that is goi
us safer as a country.

32:49.267 --> 32:52.103
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Lee, we k
even though -- if this bill pass

32:53.572 --> 32:59.010
is going to affect 10 percent of
in prison, the 10 percent who ar

33:00.478 --> 33:04.816
prison. You still have another t
individuals who are in state pri

33:05.417 --> 33:05.617
What about them?

33:07.085 --> 33:10.388
SEN. MIKE LEE: OK, so, Judy, thi
of an effort that's being replic

33:11.156 --> 33:11.323
states across the country.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.360
There are a lot of states, inclu
state of Utah, that are experime

33:16.828 --> 33:19.631
criminal justice reforms. This i
that same trend. And so we expec

33:21.099 --> 33:24.536
be replicated in many states, ac
the different needs of each stat

33:25.070 --> 33:25.871
own system.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.309
And while it's true that this re
a portion of the federal inmates

33:32.777 --> 33:34.112
inmates that are affected by thi
going to make a big difference.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.483
all the difference in the world
their families and to their comm

33:39.951 --> 33:41.453
for those who will be able to re
communities and start contributi

33:42.921 --> 33:45.757
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, Sen
even though you have clearly got

33:47.225 --> 33:49.427
bipartisan support, isn't this s
to be tough going into an electi

33:50.028 --> 33:50.362
get this passed?

33:51.830 --> 33:54.165
SEN. CORY BOOKER: Well, I think
real great allies. We have the D

33:55.634 --> 33:58.303
whip and the Republican whip. We
chairman of the Judiciary Commit

33:59.771 --> 34:03.875
really have a Congress now contr
houses by Republicans that want

34:04.643 --> 34:05.477
they can get things done.

34:06.945 --> 34:09.247
And with this kind of leadership
Party on this team, I think this

34:10.715 --> 34:13.218
that has a better chance than ma
efforts that are going on in Con

34:14.686 --> 34:18.390
now. And, again, it's not novel.
lot of these innovations going o

34:19.858 --> 34:24.095
ranging from Texas to Mississipp
to California, so I think that g

34:24.829 --> 34:25.363
greater degree of hope.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.135
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Cory Book
Mike Lee, gentlemen, we thank yo

34:31.002 --> 34:35.774
SEN. CORY BOOKER: Thank you very

34:36.641 --> 34:40.612
SEN. MIKE LEE: Thank you, Judy.

34:42.080 --> 34:50.388
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we have a
on that deadly shooting at a com

34:50.889 --> 34:51.356
in Oregon.

34:52.824 --> 34:56.194
President Obama addressed the tr
moments ago at the White House.

34:57.662 --> 35:03.435
BARACK OBAMA, President of the U
As I said just a few months ago,

35:04.903 --> 35:11.042
a few months before that, and I
time we see one of these mass sh

35:12.177 --> 35:16.181
thoughts and prayers are not eno
not enough.

35:17.649 --> 35:23.722
It doesn't capture the heartache
and anger that we should feel. A

35:25.190 --> 35:29.394
nothing to prevent this carnage
inflicted someplace else in Amer

35:30.261 --> 35:31.596
or a couple of months from now.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.266
We don't yet know why this indiv
what he did. And it's fair to sa

35:36.735 --> 35:43.775
who does this has a sickness in
regardless of what they think th

35:44.242 --> 35:45.310
may be.

35:46.778 --> 35:52.283

This great movement of refugees

But that's because it's not -- i

I see that we have given up our

who want to use freedom of speec

So, these clashes are inevitable
most European politicians believ

Now, if you want to start a deba

most prominent investment trusts

49:36.240 --> 49:41.145
And so those folks are thinking
or are going to invest in what y

49:41.745 --> 49:41.912
here and abroad?

49:42.680 --> 49:42.713
DAVID ROSENBERG: Correct.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.851
PAUL SOLMAN: So, are there going
like this in China? Are there al

49:48.319 --> 49:50.855
DAVID ROSENBERG: Eventually, the
to build these farms all over Ch

49:52.323 --> 49:58.362
PAUL SOLMAN: And what's the key
At AeroFarms' R&D facility, a fo

49:59.230 --> 50:00.297
marketing director Marc Oshima e

50:01.765 --> 50:04.201
MARC OSHIMA, AeroFarms: AeroFarm
growing with aeroponics or misti

50:05.669 --> 50:08.739
with nutrients. It's much more e
hydroponics. It's much more effe

50:09.607 --> 50:10.441
of delivering the nutrients and

50:11.909 --> 50:14.545
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the little root
hanging in the air, as opposed t

50:16.013 --> 50:18.215
MARC OSHIMA: What makes us uniqu
medium. We actually have a paten

50:19.083 --> 50:19.350
growing medium, which is cloth.

50:20.217 --> 50:20.684
PAUL SOLMAN: And the cloth is ma

50:22.152 --> 50:24.088
MARC OSHIMA: Our proprietary gro
is made out of 100 percent recyc

50:25.556 --> 50:28.125
Each one of our growing cloths i
of 26 bottles that we're taking

50:28.692 --> 50:28.459
waste stream.

50:29.827 --> 50:31.695
PAUL SOLMAN: And this is known a
farming, or verticulture.

50:33.163 --> 50:34.665
MARC OSHIMA: When we think about
farming, we think about how many

50:36.133 --> 50:38.836
beds of growing can we get in an
space. It's about that productiv

50:40.304 --> 50:44.241
foot. We're growing a wide range
leafy greens, red komatsuna. We

50:45.442 --> 50:47.711
arugula. We have Pak Choi. We ha
mustard greens.

50:48.512 --> 50:48.579
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you just...

50:49.947 --> 50:51.382
MARC OSHIMA: Enjoy it. That's on
things, ready to eat here.

50:52.850 --> 50:58.522
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, kind of mustar
arugula? This isn't your own pro

50:58.956 --> 50:58.956
is it?

51:00.424 --> 51:02.993
MARC OSHIMA: It's our proprietar
algorithm, our recipe on dialing

51:03.460 --> 51:03.360
flavor.

51:04.828 --> 51:09.266
PAUL SOLMAN: And speaking of gro
AeroFarms, Gotham Greens is as w

51:10.734 --> 51:14.605
It's now running two other urban
New York, including a brand-new

51:16.073 --> 51:20.678

above Whole Foods, and they will

51:23.514 --> 51:27.117
But there is a limit to how big
Right? I mean, you can't become

51:27.985 --> 51:29.353
or General Mills or something, r

51:30.821 --> 51:33.057
VIRAJ PURI: Perhaps one day. The
limit when it comes to agricultu

51:34.525 --> 51:37.695
PAUL SOLMAN: But hold on says, a
economist Jerry Nelson, there is

51:39.163 --> 51:43.267
food crisis in the making, he th
as things stand, the world won't

51:51.675 --> 51:57.548
You want to go to grow lights, t
got big expenses for electricity

51:59.016 --> 52:03.387
got to have clean water. And if
about doing this in Delhi or Nai

52:04.788 --> 52:05.222
question is, where are you going
right amount of clean water?

52:06.690 --> 52:11.295
PAUL SOLMAN: So, no, indoor farm
be the answer to the world's foo

52:12.363 --> 52:15.332
it's doing good and growing busi
America.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.770

The kids that were in my classes
required to be there, or in a lo

53:51.462 --> 53:53.163
they were just dumped in there b
was nowhere else to put them. So

53:54.631 --> 53:58.035
this whole population of kids wh
and were not choosing to do musi

53:59.503 --> 54:03.874
That was the impetus for the Roc

life is a mess, and then they wa
