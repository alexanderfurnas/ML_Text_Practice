JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, 2016 is
finally upon us. And it's an

00:03.470 --> 00:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election year.And we already
have a little news in the

00:06.340 --> 00:09.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presidential race, some
eye-popping fund-raising totals.

00:09.643 --> 00:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's campaign
reports a new record for a

00:13.180 --> 00:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
non-incumbent, raising $37
million for her primary bid in

00:18.252 --> 00:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the past three months alone.
Republican Ben Carson raised $23

00:22.723 --> 00:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million. And Ted Cruz has raised
about $20 million. He has not

00:26.960 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
released his official report
yet.To talk about the

00:29.763 --> 00:33.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, to look ahead to what
is in store in 2016, we have the

00:33.867 --> 00:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
analysis of Shields and Gerson.
That's syndicated columnist Mark

00:37.104 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shields and Washington Post
columnist Michael Gerson. David

00:41.108 --> 00:44.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brooks is away. nd we welcome
you both. Happy new year.

00:44.344 --> 00:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ICHAEL GERSON: Happy new year.
ARK SHIELDS: Happy new year.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: 2016 is finally
here. o, Mark, a lot of money

00:50.017 --> 00:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being raised, but I want to turn
to something. We have spent a

00:52.019 --> 00:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of time this year talking
about Donald Trump. Let's talk

00:54.021 --> 00:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about some of the so-called
mainstream Republicans who are

00:57.257 --> 01:00.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to break through,
frankly, to knock him off of his

01:00.727 --> 01:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perch.Jeb Bush has been
trying. He's had a tough week.

01:04.665 --> 01:10.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have redirected resources
and staff. Where -- do you see a

01:10.070 --> 01:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way forward for Jeb Bush? ARK
SHIELDS: Jeb Bush's only way

01:14.841 --> 01:17.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forward -- every four years,
Judy, everybody who runs for

01:17.511 --> 01:21.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president is an amateur at
running for president. It is so

01:21.081 --> 01:23.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unlike anything else, 50
different campaigns in 50

01:23.984 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different states, all those
demands.But the iron rule of

01:26.520 --> 01:30.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics prevails. And that is,
nobody has ever been elected

01:30.824 --> 01:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of the United States
in the modern era who didn't win

01:34.895 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the New Hampshire primary, at
the very worst finish second, as

01:38.498 --> 01:43.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George W. Bush did in 2000 to
John McCain, and as Barack Obama

01:43.203 --> 01:46.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did.But everybody else has
been a winner. And so, all of a

01:46.573 --> 01:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sudden, you realize all the
national headquarters I have,

01:50.077 --> 01:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national support doesn't mean
anything if I can't come out of

01:53.347 --> 01:57.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Hampshire as one of the two,
or maybe at the very worst

01:57.317 --> 02:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
third. And, right now, it looks
like, you know, Donald Trump has

02:02.189 --> 02:05.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lead. So they're fighting.
eb Bush has directed all his

02:05.759 --> 02:10.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resources. It only took 97,000
votes to win New Hampshire in

02:10.130 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2012. So, you say to yourself, I
have won Florida. John Kasich, I

02:14.634 --> 02:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have won Ohio. Chris Christie, I
have won New Jersey.And so,

02:19.072 --> 02:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of a sudden, you're saying,
I can go in with effort, energy

02:22.943 --> 02:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and time. I can persuade enough
voters to my side, and I have to

02:27.381 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do it if I'm going to survive.
UDY WOODRUFF: And so that is

02:30.183 --> 02:32.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what he has got to do.MARK
SHIELDS: That's right.JUDY

02:32.753 --> 02:36.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Michael, Iowa one
month away. We're exactly one

02:36.556 --> 02:38.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month away now from the Iowa
caucuses, and just a week later,

02:38.558 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's New Hampshire. What about
Jeb Bush? ICHAEL GERSON:

02:40.560 --> 02:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's true. All of those
candidates you're talking about

02:42.562 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take comfort in the fact that 70
percent, according to the

02:44.564 --> 02:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
historical examples, of New
Hampshire voters make their

02:48.702 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
determination in the last 30
days of the race. It breaks

02:52.305 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
late. he problem for
Republicans here is that they

02:55.642 --> 02:59.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have four pretty strong
candidates in that establishment

02:59.780 --> 03:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or mainstream Republican space.
Donald Trump has the blue-collar

03:04.685 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
populists. Ted Cruz is really
solidifying religious voters,

03:08.455 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some Tea Party voters.But this
mainstream lane has those four

03:12.959 --> 03:15.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates we have been talking
about, and all of them are good.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You watch C-SPAN and see Chris
Christie, who has been there 40

03:19.900 --> 03:23.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times. He's on his game. He's
doing really well.The Bush

03:23.570 --> 03:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign has gone through the
stages of grief, OK? They had a

03:27.908 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message problem, and they had
performance problems. And

03:31.078 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're doing better. You're
watching them in town hall

03:34.648 --> 03:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meetings. His message is very
sharp. And he's making the most

03:39.019 --> 03:43.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
principled criticism of Donald
Trump in this field and wants to

03:43.056 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collect those voters. o it's a
real showdown between talented

03:47.594 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates in this case.JUDY
WOODRUFF: Right.Does one or

03:49.863 --> 03:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another of them, Mark, have an
advantage in some way, as you

03:52.499 --> 03:56.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see it? ARK SHIELDS: I think
Christie is the best candidate.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the best natural candidate.
UDY WOODRUFF: As a campaigner.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: As a campaigner,
he's the best.But what all of

04:01.441 --> 04:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them face, Judy, is -- at this
point is that they're starting

04:04.044 --> 04:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get -- as they pop their head
up, whether it's Marco Rubio and

04:07.781 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his absenteeism from the Senate,
or it's Chris Christie and it's

04:11.585 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nine times the credit rating of
New Jersey has been lowered, or

04:15.255 --> 04:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if it's John Kasich, and the
Bush people are now -- or the

04:18.425 --> 04:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush PAC, at least, is raising
the fact that, in 1994, John

04:22.863 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kasich in the House, as a House
member, voted for the assault

04:26.266 --> 04:30.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons ban, and that this is
now a disqualification, with all

04:30.303 --> 04:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has happened in this
country.But you start to see,

04:32.806 --> 04:39.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they realize that only one of
them probably can really survive

04:39.045 --> 04:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Hampshire and Iowa. And so
the sniping at each other is

04:43.583 --> 04:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on. I would say Bush is
just the anomaly. I mean, Bush

04:47.888 --> 04:54.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had the best record going in. He
was -- he had the best peer

04:54.194 --> 04:59.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review. He had a record as a
conservative in a reasonably

04:59.132 --> 05:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservative party, a swing
state, a Latino wife. He spoke

05:03.637 --> 05:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Spanish.You know, on paper --
but he just hasn't connected,

05:07.707 --> 05:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically. And he's now down to
he's got to win Peterborough,

05:12.212 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's got to win Keene.
CROSSTALK)MICHAEL GERSON:

05:14.214 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right. And he has the best
ground game of any of the

05:16.216 --> 05:18.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates. He's got money in
the bank. ou know, Chris

05:18.952 --> 05:22.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christie, if he wins, he's
running a single-state campaign.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are real questions of
whether he could follow that up

05:24.658 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the decisive races in March.
ARK SHIELDS: Yes. I agree. I

05:27.761 --> 05:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agree.MICHAEL GERSON: Someone
like Bush could do that, or

05:29.763 --> 05:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rubio. They're building national
campaigns. They are capable of

05:31.765 --> 05:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing that. So, they're
distinguishing themselves in

05:33.934 --> 05:37.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
various ways. And the choice
will be fascinating.MARK

05:37.337 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: I will just say that I
think Bush acknowledges that

05:39.873 --> 05:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not running a national
campaign now. He knows... UDY

05:41.875 --> 05:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: By saying he's putting
staff and money...(CROSSTALK)

05:43.877 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: By putting all
the resources -- by taking the

05:46.213 --> 05:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
television money out of Iowa.
He's basically saying, New

05:48.515 --> 05:52.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hampshire is big casino for him.
think what it proves to me,

05:52.285 --> 05:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anyway, is that Chris Christie
would have been Barack Obama's

05:55.989 --> 05:59.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strongest opponent in 2012.
UDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will

05:59.359 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see what... ARK SHIELDS: I
mean, he was really -- he's just

06:01.595 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a gifted campaigner.JUDY
WOODRUFF: I want to ask you both

06:03.997 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about somebody else on the
Republican side who's having --

06:06.132 --> 06:08.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who has had an even more
difficult time this week,

06:08.134 --> 06:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael, and that's Ben Carson.
e's now had five staffers, two

06:12.973 --> 06:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very senior people leave the
campaign. Where does he stand?

06:16.543 --> 06:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ICHAEL GERSON: Well, this is
the problem of campaigning as a

06:19.179 --> 06:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidate with no experience.
You have no experience.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAUGHTER) ICHAEL GERSON: I
mean, he has not run a good

06:23.717 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign. It's imploding. He had
broad resignations on people,

06:28.021 --> 06:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he had two power centers
in the campaign that were

06:30.523 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously being played off
against one another.And all

06:33.393 --> 06:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this redounds to the benefit of
Ted Cruz, particularly in Iowa,

06:37.931 --> 06:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is, I think, picking up a
lot of that ground that Carson

06:42.535 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is conceding. UDY WOODRUFF:
And it's a reminder that money

06:44.904 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may not make the difference. As
we just said, he raised $23

06:48.208 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million in the last quarter.
ARK SHIELDS: But they spent a

06:51.077 --> 06:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of money to raise the money,
Judy. he key number in all of

06:54.514 --> 06:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those figures is cash on hand,
how much they have -- how much

06:58.218 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have spent to raise it. And
Ben Carson, it comes back, that

07:02.555 --> 07:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign has become a civil war
in a leper colony.(LAUGHTER)

07:05.091 --> 07:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: He has basically
acknowledged all of it. UDY

07:07.527 --> 07:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Oops. ARK SHIELDS:
And the recriminations back and

07:11.798 --> 07:14.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forth.And the old saw,
bromide, whether it's or not, if

07:14.434 --> 07:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can't run a campaign, how
can you run the country? And I

07:17.103 --> 07:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that is coming to...
ICHAEL GERSON: Some truth to

07:19.105 --> 07:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, yes.JUDY WOODRUFF: 2015,
ask both of you.Michael, I

07:21.941 --> 07:24.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will start with you. What were
the moments that are going to

07:24.210 --> 07:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make a difference, do you think,
as we look to this campaign

07:27.213 --> 07:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going forward?MICHAEL GERSON:
Well, the event is the obvious

07:29.683 --> 07:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one, which is, Donald Trump has
found a new way to run a

07:32.352 --> 07:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential campaign.I have
been part of three of them. You

07:35.021 --> 07:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put out policy papers. You give
speeches. You get endorsements.

07:38.058 --> 07:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You raise money. He has tweeted
his way to dominance in this new

07:42.595 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media environment. It is a new
way to conduct a campaign, the

07:47.434 --> 07:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reality television version. I
think that it's many times

07:51.071 --> 07:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vulgar and shallow, but it has
an audience, and that's clearly

07:55.508 --> 07:58.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
true. nd the moment, though,
that I think is the most

07:58.478 --> 08:03.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important is the leading
Republican candidate referring

08:03.216 --> 08:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Japanese internment, this
historical example, in December

08:07.287 --> 08:12.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a positive example in the
context of the war on terror.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: Yes. ICHAEL
GERSON: It is the -- for me,

08:14.461 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personally, that was a really
terrible moment in modern

08:18.431 --> 08:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican history. And, you
know, I think it's going to have

08:22.001 --> 08:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consequences going forward.
UDY WOODRUFF: What about for

08:24.237 --> 08:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, Mark, moments in 2015?
ARK SHIELDS: I would say the

08:28.007 --> 08:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump phenomenon. irst of all,
I have to say that Bernie

08:31.044 --> 08:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders -- the idea that Bernie
Sanders could emerge to the

08:34.581 --> 08:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point where he is, with 2.5
million contributors, with, you

08:38.351 --> 08:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, actually having changed
the terms of the debate for the

08:41.454 --> 08:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic nomination, the
dialogue, I think, is a real

08:44.824 --> 08:51.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surprise. ut, to me, the Trump
-- the Trump model, where the

08:51.431 --> 08:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unscripted sort of off-the-cuff,
no teleprompter, speaking, and

08:58.338 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making, Judy, what could at best
be called reckless statements,

09:02.208 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at worst be called divisive, but
have to be called untruths,

09:07.514 --> 09:10.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether it's, I saw thousands of
people in Jersey City on the day

09:10.650 --> 09:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of September 11 dancing in the
streets at the prospect or the

09:15.155 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reality of the... UDY
WOODRUFF: Nine-eleven.MARK

09:17.290 --> 09:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: ... World Trade Center
falling.But each of them is

09:21.361 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reckless in its own way. When he
said that 81 percent of whites

09:25.265 --> 09:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are murdered in this country
are murdered by black Americans,

09:28.635 --> 09:32.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when, in fact, it's the
opposite, I mean, the reality is

09:32.539 --> 09:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that 80 -- 16 percent of whites
are killed by black Americans

09:37.944 --> 09:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and 82 percent of whites are
killed by whites. ut -- and

09:41.748 --> 09:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then, when called on this, he
pays no price. That's -- I guess

09:45.552 --> 09:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's -- if it's our fault, if
it's the voters who are just fed

09:48.822 --> 09:50.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up, I don't know. UDY
WOODRUFF: Is that something,

09:50.824 --> 09:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though, that endures into this
next year? Do you see that

09:54.461 --> 09:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
phenomenon of being able to say
what he wants to say and having

09:58.364 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it stand lasting and having an
effect? ICHAEL GERSON: I think

10:02.368 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's raising a very fundamental
issue in American politics,

10:05.638 --> 10:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is, what is the meaning of
authenticity? s it this kind

10:09.342 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of, you know, offhand comment
that Donald Trump engages in, or

10:11.845 --> 10:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is it crafted rhetoric? Is it
careful policy? Is it

10:15.548 --> 10:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seriousness? And right now, we
have a model, a presidential

10:18.751 --> 10:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
model of authenticity that means
thoughtlessness. And I think

10:21.955 --> 10:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that that's going to have to be
retaken in the Republican Party.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: You know,
Michael, you mentioned

10:33.299 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigration, or at least what --
part of what Trump said, but

10:35.301 --> 10:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what -- Mark, what issues do you
see shaping this next -- these

10:39.806 --> 10:41.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- this next phase, the
election, and leading up to

10:41.875 --> 10:44.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
November? ARK SHIELDS: Well, I
think there's two that really

10:44.277 --> 10:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work against the Democrats,
basically, a third White House

10:47.013 --> 10:49.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
term. he first is the
revelation in surveys, in Wall

10:49.749 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street Journal/NBC poll in
particular, that 73 percent of

10:53.219 --> 10:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people want to change policies
from President Obama. So, every

10:56.489 --> 10:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election is either change or
continuity. We're going to

10:59.459 --> 11:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue or we're going to go in
a different direction.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CROSSTALK)JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
50 percent, but 73 percent...

11:05.698 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CROSSTALK)MARK SHIELDS:
Seventy-three percent want to

11:08.001 --> 11:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change the policies.That's
exactly the same number, Judy,

11:11.404 --> 11:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as it was in the summer of 2007,
when President Bush was in his

11:15.341 --> 11:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seventh year, which, remember,
2008 was very much of a change

11:19.712 --> 11:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year. And I would say the other
one is the Paris and San

11:24.817 --> 11:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernardino, when the emphasis
and the focus switched in

11:28.521 --> 11:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America, which hurt Ben Carson,
obviously, but switched to

11:32.292 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorism and sort of a fear and
war on terror.And I think that

11:38.498 --> 11:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helps Republicans have -- who,
over the past generation, are

11:41.801 --> 11:44.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seen as better than the
Democrats on national security.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whether they should be or not,
they are. UDY WOODRUFF: What

11:47.040 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues do you see?MICHAEL
GERSON: I will tell you one

11:49.208 --> 11:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hopeful issue for 2016. ith
the right lineup, with, say,

11:54.414 --> 12:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Rubio and Speaker
Ryan, both of them have tried,

12:00.219 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Republican side, to
engage the issue of poverty.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Ryan has traveled the
country looking at examples of

12:08.595 --> 12:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community-based efforts. Rubio
has put out serious policy on

12:12.699 --> 12:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EITC and other things.I'm
hoping that, under certain

12:16.302 --> 12:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
circumstances -- it would be
different from Cruz, for

12:18.571 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
example, or Trump -- but under
certain circumstances, you do

12:21.608 --> 12:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the groundwork laid for a
debate about social mobility in

12:25.044 --> 12:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this country that I think could
be very productive and is

12:28.348 --> 12:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessary.JUDY WOODRUFF: And
on that hopeful note, we will

12:31.618 --> 12:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end it and once again say happy
new year to you both, 2016.
