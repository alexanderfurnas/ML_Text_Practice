JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to
President Trump's repeated
and unsubstantiated
claim that three to five

00:07.600 --> 00:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million votes were cast
illegally in the 2016 election.

00:11.500 --> 00:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He set up a special
commission to investigate,
but one of its first acts
has drawn condemnation

00:17.233 --> 00:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from across the country.

00:18.833 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
is here with that.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yesterday, the
vice chair of that commission
sent a letter to all 50

00:27.500 --> 00:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states asking for voter data
that includes addresses,
party I.D., voter history, and

00:32.233 --> 00:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Social Security information.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission asked that data
be sent to the White House
by mid-July, but didn't say

00:38.800 --> 00:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it would be used,
other than to examine for
vulnerabilities in the system.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We take a closer look
now with Rick Hasen.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a law professor
at the University of
California, Irvine.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He writes the Election Law blog.

00:50.966 --> 00:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rick, the "NewsHour"'s
been reaching out to
states all day long.

00:54.533 --> 00:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got nine definite
no's, 18 that might comply in
whole or in part, and a few

00:59.433 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other states that are
still looking at it.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, what we hear there is
that there are apparently laws
on the books in certain states

01:05.733 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that prohibit, even if it's
public information, who can look
at the information and why it

01:10.233 --> 01:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be looked at.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Explain.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN, University of
California, Irvine: Well, some
of this information, depending

01:15.300 --> 01:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the state, is
available publicly.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People can buy it.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of this is not available.

01:20.300 --> 01:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, just before we
came on, I saw a story that Kris
Kobach himself, the personal

01:26.566 --> 01:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who has asked for this
information, he himself
cannot produce the
Social Security numbers

01:28.866 --> 01:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he has demanded because
that would violate the law
in the state of Kansas.

01:32.566 --> 01:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This doesn't seem to have
been very well thought out.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not only do we not know what
the information is going
to be used exactly to do.

01:39.733 --> 01:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't appear that this
information even legally can be
provided by a lot of the states.

01:43.733 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Kris
Kobach, as his role as secretary
of state of Kansas, can't

01:46.600 --> 01:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide the information
that he's asking for, right?

01:48.333 --> 01:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: To himself.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Got it.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

01:52.866 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, what about the
scope of the investigation?

01:54.900 --> 01:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seems to be a lot of
focus on measuring or protecting
the integrity one person, one

01:58.833 --> 02:00.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see any description in
here about any Russian meddling
that might have happened.

02:03.033 --> 02:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, so it's
not clear exactly what this
commission is going to do.

02:07.033 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, the president said
he wanted to look into the
potential for voter fraud.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a couple of Democrats
on the commission who said that
they wanted to look into Russian

02:15.566 --> 02:17.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meddling.

02:17.666 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kobach said he might be open
to that, but that wasn't on
the list of questions that

02:21.200 --> 02:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was sent to various
state election officials.

02:24.033 --> 02:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear what this
group is going to do, what
it's going to produce.

02:27.066 --> 02:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm concerned that
it's going to be something
that is just going to try
to support the president's

02:31.566 --> 02:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agenda, claiming that there's
a lot of voter fraud, and use
that to make it harder for

02:35.533 --> 02:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to be able
to register to vote.

02:38.066 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this
the kind of information
that a campaign really
would pay money for?

02:41.766 --> 02:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, in some
states, campaigns do pay money
for this kind of information.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The fact that the
information is going to
sent to the president's
office is concerning.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather than having
outside professional staff
or rather than having
social scientists who

02:57.733 --> 03:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study this information, we know
that this information is going
literally to the executive

03:03.466 --> 03:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
office of the president.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know how
it's going to be kept.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We don't know how secure
it's going to be, on
what kind of servers.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have any information.

03:09.866 --> 03:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the concerns about privacy,
about identity theft, about
the information being used for

03:13.466 --> 03:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political purposes, I think
these are all legitimate
questions to be asked.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
is there a question here on the
role of the federal government?

03:20.533 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seemed to be some pushback
from states when it came to
the Department of Homeland

03:23.833 --> 03:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security going out to them,
saying we have this potential
for hacking, we would like

03:27.066 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to help you secure
your networks.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Absolutely.

03:30.633 --> 03:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There has been this long
tradition, especially on
the Republican side, of
talking about federalism

03:34.066 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and states' rights in this area.

03:36.066 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're even seeing some
pushback now from states like
Mississippi that are saying they

03:39.333 --> 03:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not going to cooperate
with providing this information
to the federal government.

03:42.566 --> 03:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Rick Hasen, a
professor at University
of California, Irvine,

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Thank you.
