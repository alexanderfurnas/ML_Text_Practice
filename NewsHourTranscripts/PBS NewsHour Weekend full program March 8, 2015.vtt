00:11.712 --> 00:12.980
FOR SUNDAY, MARCH 8:

00:12.980 --> 00:14.514
THE LATEST FROM BAGHDAD AS IRAQI

00:14.514 --> 00:16.283
FORCES LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE

00:16.283 --> 00:17.551
AGAINST ISIS.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.319
WHY THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.588
PLANS TO RESTRUCTURE THE AGENCY.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.590
AND, IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:23.590 --> 00:25.092
THE INCREASINGLY TENSE CLIMATE

00:25.092 --> 00:26.526
FOR MUSLIMS IN FRANCE'S MOST

00:26.526 --> 00:28.595
DIVERSE CITY.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.730
>> (translated): IT'S GETTING

00:29.730 --> 00:30.264
WORSE AND WORSE.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.865
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:31.865 --> 00:33.433
GOING TO GET BETTER.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.334
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT, ON PBS

00:34.334 --> 00:36.036
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.871
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:37.871 --> 00:39.773
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:39.773 --> 00:41.375
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.309
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING

00:42.309 --> 00:43.577
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.611
TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR LEADERS

00:44.611 --> 00:45.379
TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL WITH

00:45.379 --> 00:46.213
IRAN ABOUT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.414
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOLD CBS' "FACE

00:47.414 --> 00:48.448
THE NATION" THAT WITHIN THE NEXT

00:48.448 --> 00:49.716
MONTH OR SO, HIS ADMINISTRATION

00:49.716 --> 00:50.984
NEEDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:50.984 --> 00:52.819
NEGOTIATORS CAN GET IRAN TO

00:52.819 --> 00:53.687
TRULY AGREE TO A REASONABLE

00:53.687 --> 00:56.723
DEAL.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.059
>> IF WE ARE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT

00:59.059 --> 01:01.561
IN FACT THEY ARE NOT DEVELOPING

01:01.561 --> 01:03.330
WEAPONS SYSTEMS, THEN THERE'S A

01:03.330 --> 01:04.865
DEAL TO BE HAD, BUT THAT'S GOING

01:04.865 --> 01:06.500
TO REQUIRE THEM TO ACCEPT THE

01:06.500 --> 01:08.368
KIND OF VERIFICATION AND

01:08.368 --> 01:09.803
CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR PROGRAM

01:09.803 --> 01:11.071
THAT SO FAR, AT LEAST, THEY HAVE

01:11.071 --> 01:12.673
NOT BEEN WILLING TO SAY YES TO.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.640
>> Sreenivasan: BUT TOP U.S.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.474
LAWMAKERS ARE SPLIT OVER WHETHER

01:14.474 --> 01:15.375
THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL SUCCEED AT

01:15.375 --> 01:17.477
ALL.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.812
>> LOOKS LIKE IT WILL LEAVE

01:18.812 --> 01:20.647
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE WITH ONE

01:20.647 --> 01:24.151
OF THE WORST REGIMES IN THE

01:24.151 --> 01:25.519
WORLD, THE FACT THAT THE

01:25.519 --> 01:26.853
PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT

01:26.853 --> 01:28.221
CONGRESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:28.221 --> 01:28.989
UNDERSCORES WHAT A BAD DEAL IT

01:28.989 --> 01:31.525
IS.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.659
>> LET'S SEE WHAT THE

01:32.659 --> 01:34.695
NEGOTIATION PRODUCES.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.063
LET'S HOPE THERE'S AN

01:36.063 --> 01:37.764
ALTERNATIVE TO WAR.

01:37.764 --> 01:42.502
BUT AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW.

01:42.502 --> 01:43.704
>> Sreenivasan: THOUSANDS

ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER

02:02.823 --> 02:05.292
SPOKE THERE THIS MORNING.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.827
>> HALF A CENTURY AGO, IT WAS

02:06.827 --> 02:08.428
SAID THAT NOTHING COULD STOP THE

02:08.428 --> 02:09.529
MARCHING FEET OF A DETERMINED

02:09.529 --> 02:11.164
PEOPLE.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.766

02:12.766 --> 02:14.201
SUNDAY, WE STAND TOGETHER ONCE

02:14.201 --> 02:16.069
AGAIN AS A PEOPLE.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.038
WE ARE NO LESS DETERMINED.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.241
AND WE WILL MARCH ON.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.709

02:42.462 --> 02:43.830
THERE ARE FOUR OTHER SUSPECTS IN

02:43.830 --> 02:44.564
CUSTODY WHO ARE DENYING ANY

02:44.564 --> 02:46.133
INVOLVEMENT.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.834
OFFICIALS SAY ALL OF THE

02:47.834 --> 02:49.936
SUSPECTS HAVE TIES TO CHECHNYA.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.805
IT'S BEEN EXACTLY ONE YEAR SINCE

02:51.805 --> 02:53.607
MALAYSIA AIR FLIGHT 370

DISAPPEARED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

03:02.816 --> 03:03.884
THAT POWERED THE UNDERWATER

03:03.884 --> 03:05.118
BEACON FOR THE PLANE'S FLIGHT

03:07.154 --> 03:08.855
DECEMBER 2012 AND MAY NOT HAVE

03:08.855 --> 03:10.490
BEEN REPLACED, MAKING IT EVEN

03:10.490 --> 03:12.759
HARDER TO FIND THE CRASH SITE.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.394
THE PLANE VANISHED WITH 227

03:14.394 --> 03:15.395
PASSENGERS AND 12 CREW MEMBERS

03:19.232 --> 03:20.000
FAMILIES THAT THE SEARCH WILL GO

03:20.000 --> 03:22.369
ON.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.737
A SECOND ATTACK IN AS MANY DAYS

03:23.737 --> 03:24.771
HAS ROCKED U.N. OPERATIONS IN

OTHERS.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.348

EXTREMISTS CLAIMED

03:43.790 --> 03:44.691
WERE WORKING FOR THE UNITED

03:44.691 --> 03:46.726
NATIONS.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.628
COLOMBIA'S GOVERNMENT HAS MADE

03:48.628 --> 03:49.696
AN UNPRECEDENTED DEAL WITH FARC

03:49.696 --> 03:50.864
REBELS.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.065
BOTH SIDES HAVE AGREED TO WORK

03:52.065 --> 03:53.533
TOGETHER TO REMOVE LANDMINES

03:53.533 --> 03:54.801
THAT HAVE COVERED THE

03:54.801 --> 03:56.670
COUNTRYSIDE SINCE THE 1960s.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.638
COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE MOST

03:58.638 --> 03:59.639
HEAVILY MINED NATIONS IN THE

03:59.639 --> 04:01.041
WORLD.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.843
MINES HAVE KILLED OR INJURED

MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE IN THE

04:04.111 --> 04:05.712

04:05.712 --> 04:07.414
NEGOTIATORS CALL THE AGREEMENT A

04:07.414 --> 04:09.716
GIANT STEP TOWARD MAKING PEACE.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.917
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

04:10.917 --> 04:12.419
ARE MARKING INTERNATIONAL

04:12.419 --> 04:13.854
WOMEN'S DAY TODAY, WITH RALLIES,

04:13.854 --> 04:15.722
PROTESTS AND PERFORMANCES.

THE FDNY MARCHED FOR GENDER

04:19.159 --> 04:24.164
EQUALITY IN MANHATTAN.

JOINED LOCAL WOMEN FOR A

04:26.700 --> 04:27.734
ARABIC WOMEN IN MOROCCO CARRIED

A BANNER DEMANDING DIGNITY,

04:28.735 --> 04:29.669
FREEDOM, EQUALITY AND SOCIAL

04:29.669 --> 04:30.670
JUSTICE.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.805
MOST OF THE EVENTS HAVE BEEN

04:31.805 --> 04:33.340
PEACEFUL, BUT CHINESE OFFICIALS

04:33.340 --> 04:34.875
HAVE REPORTEDLY DETAINED AT

04:34.875 --> 04:36.309
LEAST 10 WOMEN INVOLVED IN A

04:36.309 --> 04:37.511
CAMPAIGN TO FIGHT SEXUAL

04:37.511 --> 04:38.345
HARASSMENT ON PUBLIC

04:38.345 --> 04:39.679

04:39.679 --> 04:41.314
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY DATES

04:41.314 --> 04:42.949
BACK TO 1908 WHEN THOUSANDS OF

04:42.949 --> 04:44.518
WOMEN MARCHED THROUGH NEW YORK

04:44.518 --> 04:45.785
CITY DEMANDING BETTER PAY,

04:45.785 --> 05:00.300
SHORTER HOURS AND VOTING RIGHTS.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.501
>> Sreenivasan: IRAQI FORCES

05:01.501 --> 05:03.170
HAVE BEEN MAKING SIGNIFICANT

05:03.170 --> 05:05.138
HEADWAY AGAINST ISIS IN THE LAST

05:05.138 --> 05:06.773
FEW DAYS, PUSHING EXTREMIST

05:06.773 --> 05:07.774
FIGHTERS BACK OUT OF SOME OF THE

05:07.774 --> 05:09.409
TERRITORY THEY SEIZED LAST YEAR.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.977
ANNE BARNARD HAS BEEN REPORTING

05:10.977 --> 05:11.945
FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" ON THE

05:11.945 --> 05:12.546
FIGHTING AND THE RISING

05:12.546 --> 05:13.113
POLITICAL TENSION.

05:13.113 --> 05:13.780
SHE JOINS ME VIA SKYPE FROM

05:13.780 --> 05:18.051
BAGHDAD.

05:18.051 --> 05:18.785
WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE

05:18.785 --> 05:20.187
IRAQI FORCES' EFFORTS TO

05:20.187 --> 05:21.521
TAKE BACK SOME OF THE GROUND

05:21.521 --> 05:23.223
THAT ISIS GAINED LAST

05:23.223 --> 05:23.557
SUMMER.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.025
>> .

05:25.025 --> 05:26.626
>> WELL, THE REPORTS THAT

05:26.626 --> 05:29.029
THEY MOVED INTO ANOTHER

05:29.029 --> 05:31.298
VILLAGE WHICH IS CLOSE TO

05:31.298 --> 05:32.165
TIKRIT.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.334
THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN GOING

05:34.334 --> 05:37.604
FOR THE LAST WEEK, PERHAPS

05:37.604 --> 05:38.738
MORE SLOWLY THAN EXPECTED,

05:38.738 --> 05:40.407
BUT MOVING SUDDENLY AHEAD.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.175
AND THERE'S ABOUT 32,000

05:42.175 --> 05:43.343
TROOPS INVOLVED.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.579
ISIS HAS BEEN ABLE TO HOLD

05:45.579 --> 05:47.013
OUT AGAINST THEM IN THE

05:47.013 --> 05:48.548
CENTER OF TIKRIT BUT THEY

05:48.548 --> 05:49.783
LOST A NUMBER OF VILLAGES

05:49.783 --> 05:53.186
AROUND TIKRIT AND TAMARA.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.287
>> BY SOME MEASURES THIS IS

05:54.287 --> 05:55.322
A SIGN OF SUCCESS.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.923
IS THE IRAQI MILITARY READY

05:56.923 --> 05:58.992
FOR THIS FIGHT NOW?

05:58.992 --> 06:00.493
VERSUS IN OTHER TIMES WHERE

06:00.493 --> 06:02.095
WE HAD REPORTS OF THEM

06:02.095 --> 06:03.563
TURNING AWAY ON THE

06:03.563 --> 06:04.364
BATTLEFIELD AND FLEEING?

06:04.364 --> 06:04.664
>>.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.066
>> WELL, WE WERE OUT ON THE

06:06.066 --> 06:07.434
FRONT LINES THE OTHER DAY.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.868
AND WE DEFINITELY SAW, I

06:08.868 --> 06:10.904
WOULD SAY, A NEW LEVEL OF

06:10.904 --> 06:12.539
ORGANIZATION AND ENTHUSIASM.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.474
BUT I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S AS

06:14.474 --> 06:16.676
OF THE IRAQI ARMY THAT IS

06:16.676 --> 06:18.712
LEADING THE FIGHT AS THE

06:18.712 --> 06:20.747
SHIITE PAR MILITARY

06:20.747 --> 06:21.848
ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE

06:21.848 --> 06:23.783
POPULAR MOBILIST-- COMMITTEE,

06:23.783 --> 06:26.152
THE SHIITE MILITIAS WHICH

06:26.152 --> 06:27.587
ARE CLOSELY TIED TO IRAN

06:27.587 --> 06:28.955
WHICH ARE PROVIDING THE BULK

06:28.955 --> 06:29.956
OF THE FIGHTERS.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.324
AND THERE WAS A CALL THAT

06:31.324 --> 06:33.360
WENT OUT FROM SHI'A CLERICS

06:33.360 --> 06:34.427
ASKING EVERYONE TO COME AND

06:34.427 --> 06:35.295
FIGHT ISIS.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.429
AND THIS IS BASICALLY THE

06:36.429 --> 06:38.131
VEHICLE AVAILABLE TO QUICKLY

06:38.131 --> 06:39.566
MOBILIZE ALL THESE PEOPLE.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.567
>> WITH THE PRESENCE OF ALL

06:40.567 --> 06:42.836
THESE SHI'A MILITIAMEN HOW

06:42.836 --> 06:44.804
DOES THAT AFFECT THE

06:44.804 --> 06:45.805
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRAQ

06:45.805 --> 06:47.007
AND THE UNITED STATES?

06:47.007 --> 06:50.844
>> WELL, IT'S REALLY

06:50.844 --> 06:52.045
SPARKING THE TENSIONS.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.280
BECAUSE AMERICA HAS NOT

06:53.280 --> 06:54.648
PROVIDED AIR STRIKES IN THIS

06:54.648 --> 06:56.016
BATTLE THE WAY THEY HAD IN

06:56.016 --> 06:56.816
PREVIOUS BATTLES.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.318
WHEN WE WERE ON THE GROUND,

06:58.318 --> 06:59.819
MILITIA LEADERS WERE

06:59.819 --> 07:01.521
COMPLAINING BITTERLY ABOUT

07:01.521 --> 07:02.922
THIS COMPLAINING THAT IRAN

07:02.922 --> 07:03.957
WAS REALLY THE REAL FRIEND

07:03.957 --> 07:05.659
OF IRAQ AND IRAN WAS

07:05.659 --> 07:06.693
PROVIDING MUCH MORE

07:06.693 --> 07:07.894
SIGNIFICANT HELP THROUGHOUT

07:07.894 --> 07:09.429
THIS WAR THAN THE UNITED

07:09.429 --> 07:09.929
STATES.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.798
AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE

07:11.798 --> 07:12.565
AMERICANS IT'S VERY

07:12.565 --> 07:13.800
DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH

07:13.800 --> 07:15.035
MILITIAS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

07:15.035 --> 07:16.603
INVOLVED WITH ATTACKS ON

07:16.603 --> 07:17.971
AMERICAN TROOPS DURING THE

07:17.971 --> 07:18.672
U.S. OCCUPATION HERE.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.040
>> SO WHILE WE HEAR ABOUT

07:20.040 --> 07:22.075
THESE BATTLES TAKING PLACE,

07:22.075 --> 07:23.743
WE'RE ALSO IN THE WEST

07:23.743 --> 07:26.146
SEEING THIS FOOTAGE OF ISIS

07:26.146 --> 07:28.181
FORCES DESTROYING WORKS OF

07:28.181 --> 07:29.616
ART AND PLACES OF CULTURAL

07:29.616 --> 07:30.317
SIGNIFICANCE.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.584
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN

07:31.584 --> 07:33.086
BE DONE TO STOP THAT?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.354
>> UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S

07:34.354 --> 07:35.722
NOT MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE IN

07:35.722 --> 07:37.924
AREAS THAT ISIS IS CURRENTLY

07:37.924 --> 07:38.892
CONTROLLING.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.860
SOME OF THE LEADERS OF THE

07:40.860 --> 07:41.861
IRAQI CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS

07:41.861 --> 07:42.929
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ASKING

07:42.929 --> 07:45.165
FOR AIR STRIKES TO STOP THE

07:45.165 --> 07:47.267
ADVANCES OF BULLDOZERS ON

07:47.267 --> 07:47.901
THOSE SITES.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.636
I DON'T THINK AMERICAN RULES

07:49.636 --> 07:51.271
OF ENGAGEMENT CALL FOR

07:51.271 --> 07:52.972
ATTACKING BULLDOZERS BUT ON

07:52.972 --> 07:54.140
THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE SAY

07:54.140 --> 07:55.175
THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER WAY

07:55.175 --> 07:56.543
TO STOP THIS AT THE MOMENT.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.877
OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER

07:57.877 --> 07:58.912
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE AND

07:58.912 --> 08:00.847
ARE BEING WORKED ON NOW TO

08:00.847 --> 08:02.782
TRY TO MITIGATE THESE KINDS

08:02.782 --> 08:04.818
OF RISKS BY BETTER

08:04.818 --> 08:06.953
DOCUMENTING THE VERY

08:06.953 --> 08:08.321
VALUABLE ANCIENT SITES THAT

08:08.321 --> 08:09.656
ARE ALL OVER IRAQ.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.392
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A WAY TO

08:12.392 --> 08:13.727
RECOVER OBJECTS THAT MIGHT

08:13.727 --> 08:15.428
GET LOOTED OR TO RECONSTRUCT

08:15.428 --> 08:16.463
THINGS LATER.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.564
BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT

08:17.564 --> 08:18.832
CAN BE DONE ON THE GROUND.

13:29.208 --> 13:33.846
PEOPLE TREAT YOU THIS WAY?

13:34.781 --> 13:36.015
THINK IT'S FEAR OF THE OTHER.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.316
AND ALSO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING

13:37.316 --> 13:38.685
OF OUR RELIGION.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.386
ALSO I THINK THAT MUSLIMS DON'T

13:40.386 --> 13:41.954
MAKE ENOUGH EFFORT TO REACH OUT

13:41.954 --> 13:43.322
AND TO EXPLAIN THE FUNDAMENTALS

13:43.322 --> 13:44.624
OF OUR RELIGION.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.858
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RESPECT

13:45.858 --> 13:51.064
FOR OTHERS.

13:51.064 --> 13:51.898

13:51.898 --> 13:52.932
TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT FRANCE IS

13:52.932 --> 13:54.133
A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY, WITH AN

FAR-RIGHT PARTY, THE NATIONAL

14:06.846 --> 14:08.381
BECOMING ONE OF THE FIRST

POLITICIANS FROM THAT PARTY EVER

14:09.882 --> 14:12.151
ELECTED TO THE FRENCH SENATE.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.953
THE NATIONAL FRONT IS KNOWN FOR

14:13.953 --> 14:15.722
TOUGH TALK ON IMMIGRATION,

14:15.722 --> 14:18.024
SECURITY AND ISLAM, AND ITS HARD

14:18.024 --> 14:19.659
LINE ON SECULARISM, WHICH HAS

14:19.659 --> 14:20.660
OFFENDED MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM

14:20.660 --> 14:22.328
COMMUNITY.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.896
RAVIER ONCE INTERRUPTED A MUSLIM

14:23.896 --> 14:25.665
WEDDING BECAUSE THE BRIDE'S FACE

14:25.665 --> 14:26.799
WAS COVERED A VIOLATION OF

14:26.799 --> 14:32.438
FRENCH LAW.

14:35.775 --> 14:36.876
BE ENTIRELY VEILED.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.411
SO, I HAVE ONLY APPLIED THE LAW.

THAT HERE IT IS FRENCH SOIL, AND

14:46.586 --> 14:48.354
IN FRANCE, AS IT IS DONE AROUND

14:48.354 --> 14:49.789
THE WORLD, WE ALSO HAVE TO

14:49.789 --> 14:51.424
RESPECT RELIGIONS AND RITUALS,

14:51.424 --> 14:53.426
CUSTOMS, CODES.

EXTREMIST ELEMENTS AT THE HEART.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.955
THEY ARE VERY ACTIVE.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.157
AND THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES ARE

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
COMPLETELY FROZEN BECAUSE THEY

15:25.558 --> 15:27.627
FEAR BEING LABELED ISLAMOPHOBIC.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.195
THESE SMALL GROUPS OF ISLAMISTS

AMBROISE BOULEIS, A TELEVISION

15:50.082 --> 15:51.651
JOURNALIST IN MARSEILLE, WHO

15:51.651 --> 15:53.019
SAID IT'S A SURPRISING

15:53.019 --> 15:53.786
DEVELOPMENT FOR A PARTY ONCE

15:53.786 --> 15:56.689
CONSIDERED FRINGE.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.024
>> THEY ARE DOING VERY WELL.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.358
AND PART OF THE EXPLANATION

15:59.358 --> 16:00.593
MIGHT BE THAT THE ATTACKS

16:00.593 --> 16:01.928
BROUGHT BACK, ON THE SCENE,

16:01.928 --> 16:03.129
THEIR FAVORITE TOPICS.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.664
IMMIGRATION, NATIONAL SECURITY.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.332
THOSE ARE THE CORE OF THEIR

16:06.332 --> 16:08.868
POLITICAL PROGRAM.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.169
>> Reporter: AS FOR THE CLIMATE

16:10.169 --> 16:11.604
IN MARSEILLE AFTER THE ATTACKS,

16:11.604 --> 16:12.805
BOULEIS SAID, INITIALLY IT WAS

16:12.805 --> 16:14.240
QUITE TENSE.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.075
BUT HE TOLD US THE PUBLIC

16:16.075 --> 16:17.543
RESPONSE WAS MORE TEPID HERE

16:17.543 --> 16:18.978
THAN IN OTHER MAJOR FRENCH

16:18.978 --> 16:20.012
CITIES, WHERE HUNDREDS OF

16:20.012 --> 16:21.447
THOUSANDS MARCHED IN THE

16:21.447 --> 16:22.448
STREETS.

16:22.448 --> 16:23.516
BOULEIS EXPLAINED THAT WHILE

16:23.516 --> 16:24.851
MANY MUSLIMS CONDEMNED THE

16:24.851 --> 16:26.219
VIOLENCE, THEY WERE ALSO

16:26.219 --> 16:27.653
OFFENDED BY THE CARTOONS OF

16:27.653 --> 16:29.255
MOHAMMAD PUBLISHED IN THE PAPER

16:29.255 --> 16:31.390
CHARLIE HEBDO.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.725
>> MANY OF THEM DECIDED NOT TO

16:32.725 --> 16:34.126
GO OUT, DECIDED NOT TO

16:34.126 --> 16:35.394
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PUBLIC

16:35.394 --> 16:37.930
GRIEF.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.532
THEY DECIDED NOT TO SAY, "I AM

16:39.532 --> 16:40.733
CHARLIE," LIKE EVERYONE SAID

16:40.733 --> 16:42.602
THIS DAY.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.936
BUT SOME OF THEM CHOSE TO SAY,"

16:43.936 --> 16:45.571
I AM NOT CHARLIE."

16:45.571 --> 16:47.240
BECAUSE FOR THEM, SUPPORTING

16:47.240 --> 16:49.208
CHARLIE HEBDO WAS SUPPORTING THE

16:49.208 --> 16:51.744
CARICATURES OF MOHAMMAD THAT THE

16:51.744 --> 16:53.412
SATIRICAL JOURNAL HAD PUBLISHED.

16:53.412 --> 16:57.416
MANY MUSLIMS HAVE FELT

16:57.416 --> 16:59.919
STIGMATIZED AS WELL.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.354
BECAUSE THE THREE TERRORISTS

17:01.354 --> 17:02.588
CALLED THEMSELVES ISLAM

17:02.588 --> 17:04.023
DEFENDERS.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.658
SO IT LED SOME PEOPLE TO

17:05.658 --> 17:07.193
CONFLATE IN A WAY, ISLAM AND

17:07.193 --> 17:10.162
TERRORISM.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.964
AND THERE WERE SOME VERY RACIST

17:11.964 --> 17:14.066
RANTS ON THE INTERNET.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.702
SO, A LARGE PART OF THE MUSLIM

17:16.702 --> 17:21.941
COMMUNITY WAS VERY DEEPLY HURT.

17:28.748 --> 17:34.887
SEEMED TO BE LITTLE OPTIMISM.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.703
GOING TO GET BETTER.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.771
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET

18:10.156 --> 18:11.724
JOHN BRENNAN ANNOUNCED FRIDAY

18:11.724 --> 18:12.625
THAT HE IS ORDERING SWEEPING

18:12.625 --> 18:13.392
REFORMS DESIGNED TO DRAMATICALLY

18:13.392 --> 18:14.093
CHANGE THE AGENCY, STARTING AT

18:14.093 --> 18:14.827
THE TOP.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.761
BUT EXACTLY WHAT IS CHANGING AND

18:15.761 --> 18:16.696
WHY?

18:16.696 --> 18:17.563
YESTERDAY I SPOKE WITH

18:17.563 --> 18:18.331
ASSOCIATED PRESS INTELLIGENCE

18:18.331 --> 18:22.401
REPORTER KEN DILANIAN.

18:22.401 --> 18:23.436
WHY DID THE CIA DIRECTOR

18:23.436 --> 18:24.337
FEEL THESE CHANGES WERE

18:24.337 --> 18:26.405
NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.374
>> WELL, I'M NOT SURE HE'S

18:28.374 --> 18:29.508
GOING TO BE COMPLETELY

18:29.508 --> 18:30.509
LEVELING WITH US ABOUT THAT.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.611
BUT I CAN SAY THAT IT COMES

18:32.611 --> 18:34.280
AMID THE BACKDROP OF A

18:34.280 --> 18:35.314
SERIES OF INTELLIGENCE

18:35.314 --> 18:37.516
FAILURES WHERE THE CIA HAS

18:37.516 --> 18:39.318
NOT PREDICTED MAJOR GLOBAL

18:39.318 --> 18:40.086
DEVELOPMENTS.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.087
WHETHER YOU WANT TO TALK

18:41.087 --> 18:42.521
ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS

18:42.521 --> 18:43.856
DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ OR THE

18:43.856 --> 18:44.991
MOVEMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS

18:44.991 --> 18:47.693
IN THE U. UKRAINE OR THE

18:47.693 --> 18:48.995
RAPID RISE OF THE --

18:48.995 --> 18:50.830
>> THERE IS A FELLING THAT

18:50.830 --> 18:52.298
SINCE THE CIA HAS DONE

18:52.298 --> 18:53.532
INCREDIBLY WELL

18:53.532 --> 18:54.834
SINCE 9/11 THERE ARE ALSO

18:54.834 --> 18:55.368
SOME GAPS.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.302
AND THE WORLD IS CHANGING A

18:56.302 --> 18:57.036
LOT.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.637
SO DIRECTOR BRENNAN

18:58.637 --> 19:00.373
ASSEMBLED A GROUP OF EXPERTS

19:00.373 --> 19:02.274
AND INTERNAL PEOPLE AND

19:02.274 --> 19:03.876
LOOKED FOR THREE MONTHS

19:03.876 --> 19:04.677
INTENSIVELY AT THE AGENCY'S

19:04.677 --> 19:05.911
FUNCTIONS AND CAME UP WITH

19:05.911 --> 19:06.879
THIS PLAN.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.614
>> SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS

19:08.614 --> 19:09.515
WAS TO BREAK DOWN THE LAW

19:09.515 --> 19:10.783
THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE

19:10.783 --> 19:12.218
ANALYSTS AND THE OPERATORS.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.919
AND TO MOST OF US, I DIDN'T

19:13.919 --> 19:14.687
REALIZE THERE WAS THAT WALL

19:14.687 --> 19:16.655
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.323
>> RIGHT.

19:17.323 --> 19:17.990
AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.292
THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHANGE

19:20.292 --> 19:21.660
BRENNAN IS IMPLEMENTING

19:21.660 --> 19:22.228
HERE.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.029
THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE

19:23.029 --> 19:23.763
AGENCY'S CHARACTER.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.464
SINCE IT WAS CREATED IN

19:25.464 --> 19:25.798
1947.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.199
THE OPERATORS ARE PEOPLE WHO

19:27.199 --> 19:29.201
RECRUIT SPIES, WHO RUN

19:29.201 --> 19:29.902
COVERT OPERATIONS.

19:29.902 --> 19:30.970
AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

19:30.970 --> 19:31.303
BOSSES.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.438
THEY WORK IN THEIR OWN

19:32.438 --> 19:33.773
OFFICES FOR THE MOST PART.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.807
AND THE ANALYSTS ARE

19:34.807 --> 19:36.008
DIFFERENT, THEY'RE MORE LIKE

19:36.008 --> 19:37.176
COLLEGE PROFESSORS, THEY

19:37.176 --> 19:38.811
TAKE THE INTELLIGENCE

19:38.811 --> 19:40.012
COLLECTED BY THE OPERATORS

19:40.012 --> 19:41.280
AND INTERPRET IT AND WRITE

19:41.280 --> 19:42.481
PAPERS THAT ARE COLLECTED BY

19:42.481 --> 19:43.516
THE PRESIDENT.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.452
THERE ARE PART OF THE CIA

19:46.452 --> 19:48.054
INCLUDING NOW, THE

19:48.054 --> 19:49.822
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER THAT

19:49.822 --> 19:50.856
IS-- BUT FOR THE MOST PART

19:50.856 --> 19:51.724
THEY DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.625
AND UNDER THIS CHANGE THEY

19:52.625 --> 19:53.993
WOULD BEGIN WORKING TOGETHER,

19:53.993 --> 19:55.694
IN TEN SO-CALLED CENTERS

19:55.694 --> 19:57.129
WHICH WOULD SORT OF EITHER

19:57.129 --> 19:58.164
BE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE

19:58.164 --> 19:59.498
WORLD OR IN SOME CASES

19:59.498 --> 20:02.301
SUBJECT AREAS LIKE

20:02.301 --> 20:03.602
COUNTERPROLIFERATION.

20:03.602 --> 20:04.937
>> Sreenivasan: BUT WHAT WAS

20:04.937 --> 20:07.073
THE RATIONALE BEHIND KEEPING

20:07.073 --> 20:08.007
THESE TEAMS SEPARATE?

20:08.007 --> 20:09.608
>> WELL, I MEAN, THERE'S A

20:09.608 --> 20:10.810
SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT SAYS

20:10.810 --> 20:12.912
ANALYSTS ARE MORE OBJECTIVE

20:12.912 --> 20:14.346
WHEN THEY ARE NOT-- WHEN

20:14.346 --> 20:15.614
THEY ARE NOT WORKING CLOSELY

20:15.614 --> 20:16.449
WITH THE COLLECTOR.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.349
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

20:17.349 --> 20:18.617
HAVE A STAKE IN THE

20:18.617 --> 20:19.351
INTELLIGENCE OR THE

20:19.351 --> 20:19.718
OPERATION.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.053
THEY JUST WANT TO CALL IF AS

20:21.053 --> 20:22.154
THEY SEE IT BUT OTHERS HAVE

20:22.154 --> 20:24.090
SAID, LOOK, WE'RE NOT SEEING

20:24.090 --> 20:26.559
VERY MUCH OF A COMPROMISE OF

20:26.559 --> 20:27.560
OBJECTIVITY IN AREAS WHERE

20:27.560 --> 20:28.894
ANALYSTS AND OPERATORS DO

20:28.894 --> 20:29.929
WORK TOGETHER SO WE'RE NOT

20:29.929 --> 20:30.629
SO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

20:30.629 --> 20:31.497
PROBLEM.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.631
BUT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT

20:32.631 --> 20:33.232
DISCIPLINES.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.066
OPERATORS ARE THE ONES THAT

20:34.066 --> 20:35.367
GO TO THE FARM AND GET

20:35.367 --> 20:37.369
TRAINED AND SPY, TRADE CRAFT,

20:37.369 --> 20:38.137
SURVEILLANCE DETECTION AND

20:38.137 --> 20:39.071
ALL OF THAT.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.172
ANALYSTS WORK IN OFFICES FOR

20:40.172 --> 20:41.707
THE MOST PART I'M

20:41.707 --> 20:43.609
GENERALIZING AND THE

20:43.609 --> 20:44.276
INTELLIGENCE.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.312
SINCE 9/11 ANALYSTS HAVE

20:46.312 --> 20:48.080
BEEN DEPLOYED MORE OFF TONE

20:48.080 --> 20:49.348
WAR ZONES AND THERE HAS BEEN

20:49.348 --> 20:51.317
A COMINGLING AND THIS IS THE

20:51.317 --> 20:52.151
ULTIMATE RESULT OF THAT.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.586
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THIS FOCUS

20:53.586 --> 20:54.620
ON CYBERTHREATS.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.821
WHAT DOES HE PLAN TO DO?

20:55.821 --> 20:57.756
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY

20:57.756 --> 20:59.358
THE CIA DOES A LOT OF

20:59.358 --> 21:00.726
HACKING AND CYBERSTUFF NOW.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.161
BUT WHAT HE IS DOING IS

21:02.161 --> 21:03.863
SETTING UP A DIRECTORATE

21:03.863 --> 21:05.965
WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT,

21:05.965 --> 21:06.665
DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONS,

21:06.665 --> 21:08.000
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND

21:08.000 --> 21:09.034
DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.004
THIS WOULD BE A DIRECTORATE

21:12.004 --> 21:13.806
FOR SIGN THEIR WOULD LOOK

21:13.806 --> 21:14.907
FOR THAT ACROSS THE AGENCY

21:14.907 --> 21:16.242
AND TRYING TO UP THEIR GAME

21:16.242 --> 21:17.676
IN TERMS OF HACKING, WHETHER

21:17.676 --> 21:20.379
IT'S HACKING INTO A PASS

21:20.379 --> 21:22.414
WORE DATABASE TO PROTECT AN

21:22.414 --> 21:23.516
ALIASES OR TRYING TO GET

21:23.516 --> 21:24.350
INFORMATION ABOUT THE

21:24.350 --> 21:25.751
ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA WHERE

21:25.751 --> 21:26.785
THEY CAN'T GO IN.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.154
SO THERE'S A FEELING THAT,

21:28.154 --> 21:29.622
YOU KNOW, THEY NEED TO SORT

21:29.622 --> 21:31.891
OF GET WITH THE TIMES AND

21:31.891 --> 21:32.958
REALLY ENHANCE THEIR

21:32.958 --> 21:33.826
CYBERCAPABILITY AND THIS IS

21:33.826 --> 21:38.063
ONE WAY TO DO THAT.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.365
>> KEN DILANIAN, THANKS SO

21:39.365 --> 21:39.698
MUCH.

21:39.698 --> 21:50.509
