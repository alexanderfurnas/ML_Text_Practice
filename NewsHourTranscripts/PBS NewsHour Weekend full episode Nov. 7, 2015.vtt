04:08.582 --> 04:09.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BILL, WHICH NOW GOES BACK TO

04:09.983 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE, APPROVED SIX YEARS

04:12.052 --> 04:14.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PROJECTS BUT FUNDING FOR ONLY

04:14.154 --> 04:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE YEARS.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES IS

04:16.323 --> 04:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CONGRESS WON'T RAISE THE

04:17.724 --> 04:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:19.259 --> 04:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS; IT'S

04:20.894 --> 04:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN STUCK AT 18 CENTS A GALLON

04:22.829 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE 1993.

04:24.831 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINING ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON

04:25.966 --> 04:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:27.467 --> 04:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:28.668 --> 04:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTER FOR "U.S.A. TODAY."

04:29.669 --> 04:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:30.470 --> 04:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATH THAT ONLY SEEMS TO WORK IN

04:31.905 --> 04:33.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS WHERE YOU CAN APPROVE

04:33.106 --> 04:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE A PROJECT FOR SIX YEARS

04:34.441 --> 04:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONLY FUND IT FOR THREE.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT

04:38.578 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY GOT A SIX-YEAR BILL

04:40.113 --> 04:41.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY HOPE TO RECONCILE AND

04:41.948 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET COMPLETED, GET SENT TO THE

04:44.151 --> 04:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S DESK BY

04:45.418 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKSGIVING.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST TIME WE HAD A SIX-YEAR

04:47.821 --> 04:49.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL WAS 1998.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FOUR-YEAR BILL THAT EXPIRED

04:51.525 --> 04:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2009, THERE HAVE BEEN 35

04:54.127 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHORT-TERM EXTENSIONS SINCE

04:56.396 --> 04:57.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO EVERYBODY'S PLEASED TO GET A

04:58.498 --> 04:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX-YEAR SET OF POLICIES SO THAT

04:59.266 --> 05:01.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS CAN

05:01.268 --> 05:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAN ROAD BUILDING, BRIDGE

05:03.236 --> 05:05.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:05.105 --> 05:06.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD PART COMES-- HOW DO YOU

05:06.606 --> 05:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT $325

05:13.713 --> 05:13.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR $342 BILLION WORTH OF

05:13.180 --> 05:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRUCTION GOALS.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHERE HAVE

05:17.384 --> 05:19.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FOUND THE FUNDING SO FAR?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT NIPS AND CUTS HAVE BEEN

05:20.954 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE TO TRY TO MAKE THIS

05:22.489 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE?

05:22.889 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO FAR, THERE ARE THREE MAJOR

05:27.060 --> 05:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTS OF MONEY TO ADD TO THE

05:28.094 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOUNT THEY RAISE FROM THE GAS

05:29.362 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAX.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULD TAKE-- THE SENATE

05:32.165 --> 05:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSION WOULD TAKE $17 BILLION

05:34.801 --> 05:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM DIVIDENDS THAT THE FEDERAL

05:36.236 --> 05:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESERVE PAYS TO BANKS FOR

05:38.038 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTING IN THE FEDERAL

05:39.839 --> 05:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESERVE.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ALSO $9 BILLION FROM A

05:43.476 --> 05:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SELL-OFF OF A PORTION OF THE

05:45.078 --> 05:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE'S $9 BILLION IN

05:49.115 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY TRAVEL FEES PAID TO

05:51.318 --> 05:52.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUSTOMS AND TO THE

ADMINISTRATION.

05:55.021 --> 05:59.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE AMOUNTS ARE COMBINING TO

05:59.159 --> 06:00.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY BOLSTER THE GAS TAX.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

06:01.528 --> 06:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RIGHT

06:04.030 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW?

06:04.664 --> 06:05.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY IS THIS SPENDING EVEN

06:05.599 --> 06:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARY?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, ONE OF THE REASONS

06:07.901 --> 06:09.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWMAKERS ARE JOINED IN AGREEING

06:09.336 --> 06:11.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SPENDING NEEDS TO GO UP IS

06:11.171 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN SEE

06:13.006 --> 06:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTHOLES IN THE ROAD OR TROUBLES

06:14.541 --> 06:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THEIR SUBWAYS.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT

06:19.412 --> 06:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLES WAS IN 2007, THE

06:21.781 --> 06:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERSTATE 35 BRIDGE IN

06:23.183 --> 06:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINNEAPOLIS COLLAPSED, KILLING

06:25.018 --> 06:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
13 PEOPLE.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WASHINGTON HERE, OUR SUBWAY

06:29.789 --> 06:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM HAS ROUTINE FIRES AND A

06:31.424 --> 06:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN DIED FROM THE SMOKE OF A

06:34.194 --> 06:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRE IN JANUARY IN ONE OF THE

06:35.795 --> 06:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBWAY TUNNELS.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S A PROBLEM THAT LAWMAKERS

06:37.864 --> 06:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE AWARE OF IN BOTH PARTIES.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY

06:42.636 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID AS THEY

06:44.037 --> 06:45.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE WHETHER TO SPEND ABOUT

06:45.839 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:47.974 --> 06:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT

06:48.842 --> 06:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD TAKE $65 BILLION TO $83

06:52.045 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLION A YEAR JUST TO MAINTAIN

CURRENT STANDARDS.

06:55.882 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FEDERAL TRANSIT

06:56.783 --> 06:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THERE

06:58.418 --> 07:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A $76 BILLION BACKLOG IN

07:01.454 --> 07:02.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRANSIT PROJECTS NATIONWIDE.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE HIGHWAY FOLKS AT THE

TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS,

07:11.698 --> 07:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTIMATE THERE IS A $700 BILLION

ALSO BRIDGES.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM IS

07:23.076 --> 07:23.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREED UPON.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO PAY TO FIX

07:25.445 --> 07:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE PROBLEMS.
