Lisa joins us now from Capitol Hlatest.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, hello.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not quite a done deal, butthe Democrats are celebrating al

12:39.559 --> 12:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, Democrats celebrating over in the Senate.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of the top Senate Democratswith reporters in the last two h

12:47.266 --> 12:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they feel like this is an incredThis is a done deal in terms of

12:51.170 --> 12:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
final offer from leaders in bothand the Senate, Judy. But, of co

12:54.540 --> 12:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voting matters here.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have to tell you, Judy, tolooks like this deal does have v

12:59.979 --> 13:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the House and the Senate largelythose Democrats, as you were say

13:04.217 --> 13:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Lisa, what where? What was the politics? We

13:07.353 --> 13:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both sides had to do some tradin

13:09.656 --> 13:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were immense politics invoof course, and it depends on who

13:14.093 --> 13:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to. Everyone is going to claim oanother. But if you take a step

13:18.231 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got something they wanted very mis a rollback of some steep spen

13:23.069 --> 13:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were going to go in place fnon-defense programs last year.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans basically got the sathe defense programs that they l

13:31.678 --> 13:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has said it was really going to those cuts called sequester next

13:37.350 --> 13:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two sides easily divided how thethose cuts. Now, that's somethin

13:41.988 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans say wasn't fair becamore votes, they wanted to only

13:47.260 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in the end, Democrats were away with some money for some ot

13:52.765 --> 13:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs. Now, this bill is fullaspects as well. One other thing

13:57.136 --> 14:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point out, Judy, there are changof it is paid by for changes in

14:00.807 --> 14:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act, Obamacare.

14:03.142 --> 14:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For example, a requirement on lathat would automatically enroll

14:08.748 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in health care, that would be frThat's a win for Republicans. So

14:12.652 --> 14:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to look through this deal. lot for everyone here.

14:16.656 --> 14:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One thing that Republicans didn'is any savings on the debt. This

14:21.761 --> 14:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways will increase the deficit, on how you look at it. It's a bi

14:25.998 --> 14:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gimmick, some people say.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, what about tentitlement programs, Medicare,

14:31.771 --> 14:32.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they affected by this?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They are. Therenews here.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some Medicare recipients were faserious increase in premiums nex

14:41.514 --> 14:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is now going to be frozen and spso that those premiums will go u

14:47.053 --> 14:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, rather than next year. Sowas facing perhaps the biggest c

14:52.091 --> 14:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entitlement program next year. Iinsurance was facing a cut in be

14:56.963 --> 14:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was running out of money next ye

14:59.832 --> 15:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now that program will gain anothof life, go through 2022 in this

15:04.971 --> 15:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, is Speaker to push this through even withou

15:11.778 --> 15:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans, in other words, witof Democrats in the House?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that's important things here. That migh

15:18.117 --> 15:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important thing, that what happeSpeaker Boehner and also Majorit

15:23.089 --> 15:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Senate Mitch McConnell got ttheir Democratic counterparts an

15:27.727 --> 15:30.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were going to govern, they to get past these crises, even i

15:31.697 --> 15:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a combination of Democratic votethe House, maybe more Democratic

15:35.301 --> 15:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican votes.

15:37.236 --> 15:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, Speaker Boehner is ready tobasically with Democratic votes.

15:41.974 --> 15:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an amazing thing to think about.and two days ago, Judy, we were

15:46.345 --> 15:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Speaker Boehner having just resiHouse in disarray.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Speaker Boehner also I thinkto get through these crises and

15:55.221 --> 15:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was basically the four leaderand Republican, against the Hous

16:00.326 --> 16:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the leaders showing this is to govern.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on so many vohe wouldn't do it with Democrats

16:05.431 --> 16:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what it would take.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But it will takand he's doing it.

20:09.575 --> 20:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Martin, you're putting the face that most of us never get to see

20:14.246 --> 20:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all, the practicality of thisyou get in?

20:17.716 --> 20:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: Well, I had workedthan a year, trying various aven

20:23.489 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in. Some reporters can get in anshort-term visas, maybe one week

20:29.095 --> 20:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
couple of days' extension, but Itime if I was going to put toget

20:32.598 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on this.

20:34.667 --> 20:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I got a phone call. Somme access to a trove of footage

20:41.941 --> 20:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young journalist, maybe more thaover the last four-and-a-half ye

20:48.380 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked if I was interested in looI said, sure, but I would like t

20:51.383 --> 20:55.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and look at it. And then the promore ambitious after that. I sta

20:57.223 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we planned travel together, and to make this trip.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one of the things about the have a time limit. I stayed a fu

21:08.467 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could have stayed longer, and wethe usual minder from the minist

21:12.705 --> 21:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the foreign media departmenof journalists are saddled with.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I want to ask the surprises, and the surprises

21:21.380 --> 21:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be whether anybody would feel frto you, a Western journalist, an

21:25.684 --> 21:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticize Assad.

21:26.852 --> 21:27.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: No.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that is a red line for tare not going to criticize Assad

21:34.193 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they risk a beating or wgenerally will say very kind thi

21:42.034 --> 21:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patriotic things about Assad. Buthings you learn over time is th

21:46.138 --> 21:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
listen to people and you ask theoften, they will just go on and

21:49.441 --> 21:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian nation, the Syrian st

21:53.078 --> 21:56.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they are most concerned aboAssad and his future. They're co

21:58.050 --> 22:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their future. They're concerned services that the state provides

22:02.855 --> 22:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's water, electricity, sewer, They saw what happened in Iraq.

22:08.093 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened in Libya when those dicdeposed. They don't want that to

22:13.199 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Did you see any signof what we're now -- what now lo

22:19.338 --> 22:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more every day like a proxy war up in Syria involving Moscow and

22:24.577 --> 22:27.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: Well, it's been a for some time.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians have been in there,have been in there, the Chinese

22:31.450 --> 22:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in there on the side. Of course,referring to the fact that the R

22:36.956 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directly involved in running airand launching missiles into Syri

22:43.896 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was -- while we were there-- we saw there were Russian off

22:49.101 --> 22:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
central market. I didn't know whdoing there. There was the activ

22:54.974 --> 22:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alawite heartland around LatakiaMediterranean of -- expansion of

23:00.512 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it didn't happen until afterthe Russians directly entered th

23:03.949 --> 23:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, last week, Assad travto strategize with Putin.

23:07.586 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So how do the peoplespoke to view the U.S. involveme

23:11.724 --> 23:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against the Islamic State?

23:13.325 --> 23:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: It's interesting.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A number of people pulled me asiwould say to me, who do you thin

23:20.599 --> 23:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS? And I would say, well, thaquestion. I know their roots. An

23:27.439 --> 23:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, well, it's the U.S. And I wwell, how do you -- how do you m

23:32.645 --> 23:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they would say, well, if youHumvees, their vehicles, their w

23:36.782 --> 23:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ammunition, it all comes from thso the United States is supporti

23:40.919 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, well, no, the Unitedwere stolen from Mosul when they

23:45.891 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mosul in Northern Iraq.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But their idea of the United Stadistrustful. And, you know, this

23:54.033 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the world where conspiracies of education, in many cases, lea

23:58.270 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of wild conspiracy theories. So belief -- and they also conflate

24:02.207 --> 24:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enemies.

24:03.442 --> 24:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the fact that the United StaWestern-backed, you know, rebels

24:10.082 --> 24:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moderate rebels, and you have ISother end of the spectrum, they

24:14.887 --> 24:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that together and they call everthe schoolchildren in the clip t

24:19.325 --> 24:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
termed them, terrorists. They'rein their view.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You spent more time there than most of us get to, an

24:28.133 --> 24:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away with, I'm sure, a whole lotimages, as we just saw outside o

24:33.672 --> 24:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What -- is it possible for you tdown to the single most kind of

24:38.410 --> 24:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you had while you were ther

24:41.413 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: There were a numbeI mean, the new resort being ope

24:47.252 --> 24:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
few miles from the absolutely deof Homs city, the fact that whil

24:55.194 --> 24:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raining mortars on Damascus and was responding with a bombing ca

25:01.333 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the suburbs, I was invitethe Syrian National Symphony, wh

25:05.337 --> 25:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a beautiful rendition of one of dances.

25:10.142 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there was a beach resortAt the same time, I met people w

25:17.316 --> 25:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the war, whose emotion was a lot of women who were extremel

25:21.787 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they are facing. So, it wasof both.

25:26.692 --> 25:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Martin Smith, we wiltonight on most PBS stations for

physician.

26:23.816 --> 26:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de Saon how the Dalai Lama inspired a

native to move halfway across thbring compassion back into a med

26:34.426 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system dominated by technology.

26:37.696 --> 26:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The report is part of Fred's ongAgents for Change.

26:41.900 --> 26:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sixty-eight-native Barry Kerzin began his ca

to a pro bono house calls thousaaway in Tibetan.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN, Scholar: I keemyself, Fred. I don't know.

27:02.721 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(LAUGHTER)

27:03.956 --> 27:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He first arrafter hearing that the Dalai Lam

27:08.260 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Western physician to train tradoctors in modern research metho

27:13.532 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN, Scholar: We distudy. And we used that pedagogi

27:20.339 --> 27:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the local Tibetan medicine doctodo the research.

27:24.042 --> 27:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I got more involved witI had already been very interest

27:29.748 --> 27:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more involved with meditation anI ended up extending my stay. An

again and again and here I am 27

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He came to Ia life punctuated by pain and lo

from cancer.

27:59.945 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Buddhism became a sanctuary undeof the Dalai Lama, who told him

28:04.383 --> 28:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the world.

28:06.218 --> 28:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN: He always encoto keep my credentials and to co

28:12.424 --> 28:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medicine. Don't just do the wisdthe love and the compassion. In

28:18.931 --> 28:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
50/50. Those were his words.

28:20.532 --> 28:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Scholarship led to his ordination as a monk,

28:25.771 --> 28:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been a path to inner peace aAnd that's translated into empat

28:31.343 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN: It's slowly moto be more compassionate, to be

28:37.616 --> 28:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't get angry very much anymto be highly competitive. I'm st

28:42.020 --> 28:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
competitive, but it's more now pat the expense of somebody else.

28:47.326 --> 28:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a combination of meditation and Holiness calls, emotional hygien

28:54.299 --> 28:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Kerzin, who as a personal physician to the D

28:58.737 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has taken the spiritual leader'semotional hygiene and compassion

Go to Japan, go to Mongolia.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And full cir

29:14.987 --> 29:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN: It's lovely to

29:17.789 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few years lecture at a top U.S. medical sc

29:22.828 --> 29:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been given by a man who lefmedicine and many stunned collea

very different world, where he da house, car or refrigerator.

29:32.904 --> 29:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN: I think initiaI went off the deep end. What ar

29:37.909 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living in India? Come on. You knyou stay healthy? Why don't you

29:43.782 --> 29:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you could have a very good lhave a very good academic life i

29:49.421 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could have a very comfortabllife. It's ridiculous what you'r

29:56.228 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let's meditate, OK?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But on this were listening, even meditating,

30:03.068 --> 30:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kerzin says meditation helps onethe now, the present. You tune o

30:09.408 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and all your regrets, tune out pworry about the future. It's tak

30:14.813 --> 30:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he says, but gotten results, scimeasured results.

30:18.917 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. BARRY KERZIN: This is in MadUniversity of Wisconsin, and the

30:23.555 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my brain.

30:25.057 --> 30:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Kerzin has ba series of studies into the imp

GWEN IFILL: Now: A new study sposoaring financial and emotional

32:47.465 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many families are coping with frand Alzheimer's disease.

32:51.937 --> 32:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cost of caregiving for thoseis now some of the highest of an

32:56.775 --> 32:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has the story

32:58.577 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Researchers athave just published a study show

33:03.381 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for patients with dementia and Adisease is far more expensive th

33:07.686 --> 33:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for those with illnesses like cadisease.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
According to the study, which lowithin the last five years of th

33:14.860 --> 33:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the total cost of caring for somdementia costs 57 percent more t

33:20.332 --> 33:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with other illnesses. And dementand their families also pay 81 p

33:24.669 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in out-of-pocket expenses than o

33:28.039 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This year alone, dementia will c$226 billion.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining me now is Dr. Diane MeieIcahn School of Medicine at Moun

33:37.549 --> 33:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't an author of this particubut she's one of the nation's le

33:40.585 --> 33:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care for the elderly.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Dr. Meier, what is it that mout at you about this study?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER, Icahn School ofMount Sinai Hospital: I think wh

33:49.027 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out at me, and I hope to the genabout this study, is the realiza

33:54.966 --> 34:00.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so much of health care is not coor by regular insurance, and tha

34:01.840 --> 34:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal of the needs of older adulthelp during the day, particularl

34:07.712 --> 34:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have memory problems, come rightpockets of the patient and the f

34:12.484 --> 34:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, is that whhuge disparity, why people who a

34:16.821 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for people with dementia are paymore of their own money to care

34:20.058 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loved ones?

34:21.226 --> 34:22.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: That is the rea

34:24.262 --> 34:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People with dementia, that diseaby a progressive loss of ability

34:29.901 --> 34:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of yourself, to dress yourself, feed yourself, to have judgment

34:36.641 --> 34:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what that means is that you a dementia patient alone. So, fa

34:41.980 --> 34:46.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that either by having someone ingive up their other responsibili

34:47.519 --> 34:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up their work in order to be witwho has dementia, or by paying o

34:53.625 --> 34:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pay someone, an aide or a combe with their loved one with dem

34:58.096 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Either way, there's a huge cost that is not covered by Medicare.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This study alsthat the costs fall disproportio

35:07.038 --> 35:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blacks and single people and peoeducation. Is that just a functi

35:11.876 --> 35:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relative financial situation?

35:14.512 --> 35:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: Mostly, it's a their relative financial situati

35:19.150 --> 35:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are also some cultural difwillingness to take care of vuln

35:26.925 --> 35:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ones. Some cultures are much morto providing family-level care a

35:32.530 --> 35:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care to loved ones who are ill othan others, and certainly the A

35:37.469 --> 35:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community has a very strong histcare of their own.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have obvioa good deal of your own career c

35:44.976 --> 35:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people at the end of their livesheard stories like this from you

35:48.680 --> 35:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and from their families that thebeen onerous?

35:51.349 --> 35:56.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: I have had manywho bankrupted their -- for exam

35:58.423 --> 36:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents' savings, completely spetheir parents' savings, and then

36:02.427 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending their own savings.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their child's college savings acexample, the money they had been

36:09.401 --> 36:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a mortgage had to be spent for ttheir parent who had Alzheimer's

36:14.939 --> 36:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I remember one family in parone of the daughters had the res

36:20.412 --> 36:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for caring for the mom who had Adisease, and she provided wonder

36:24.716 --> 36:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her mother for more than 15 year

36:27.719 --> 36:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when her mother finally diedhad no job, no visible means of

36:36.027 --> 36:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skills, and was basically put onrolls because she had no income

36:44.035 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on, because she had devoted mostlife to the care of her mother.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, it's awfu

36:50.108 --> 36:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, put your policy-making hat owere in the policy-making busine

36:54.279 --> 36:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we address this? What would you

36:56.481 --> 37:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: Well, when Mediwere written, it said that Medic

37:01.252 --> 37:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only pay for what is -- quote --necessary."

37:04.656 --> 37:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at that time, that was thouglike surgery or a hip replacemen

37:11.663 --> 37:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a heart attack or visiting athere wasn't a recognition at th

37:16.634 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it hadn't yet happened, that oldto be very different in our era

37:21.739 --> 37:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back in the 1960s.

37:23.875 --> 37:28.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Old age in our era is chronic digoes on for many, many years, so

37:30.014 --> 37:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than decades, and it's characterneeding help to get through the

37:35.086 --> 37:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't pay for that. Yet that ineed of older adults and their f

37:40.458 --> 37:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our society.

37:42.227 --> 37:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think we need to rethink hfor health care and pay for heal

37:47.065 --> 37:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a manner that actually meets peo

37:51.002 --> 37:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This study obvjust at financial costs, but, ob

37:55.206 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for someone with dementia comes emotional cost as well. I mean,

37:58.676 --> 37:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even factored into this study.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: Correct.

38:04.349 --> 38:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dementia is an extremely difficuserious illness. I think it is t

38:09.654 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
illness I have ever participatedfor, worse for the patient and f

38:15.126 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for example, cancer or heart disof the other dreaded illnesses,

38:21.266 --> 38:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happens is the person's mind begwhile their body is still there.

38:26.871 --> 38:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there is this complicated sithe person still being in front

38:31.976 --> 38:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not inside anymore. And and the loss begins many, many y

38:38.983 --> 38:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the person's death. And I think not only for the person living w

38:46.191 --> 38:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loss, but also for the people whperson, is enormous.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.of Mount Sinai Hospital, thank y

38:53.665 --> 38:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DIANE MEIER: Thank you.

JEFFREY BROWN: Each morning, as on this medieval town seemingly

39:26.397 --> 39:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a fairy tale, the narrow lanes oBagnoregio are quiet. By the lat

39:32.136 --> 39:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are just seven year-round and who knows how many cats.

39:52.757 --> 39:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By mid-morning, though, the scenbeautiful fall day has changed,

39:57.762 --> 40:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of tourists make the difficult hsteep footbridge. There's no car

40:03.368 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, drawn by the beauty and peof this place, where staircases

40:08.940 --> 40:10.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and windows lead into the clouds

40:11.976 --> 40:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Italian, it's called la Cittathe Dying City, dying because it

40:17.415 --> 40:21.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crumbling before our eyes. But ngeological engineering and touri

CLAUDIO MARGOTTINI, Italy GeologAfter we have a collapse, it tak

40:27.558 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three, 10 years to have the nextin the same part of the cliff.

several decades.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, here's part of the problem, falling down?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAUDIO MARGOTTINI: Yes, exactlyexactly an example of what the p

40:45.243 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this town. So, we are just clcliff. And the cliff is falling

40:50.815 --> 40:53.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by piece, maybe five, six meters

40:54.485 --> 40:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

my point is that, if someone sucdown one of our power grids -- a

47:51.535 --> 47:56.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The secretary of defense at the Panetta, called the threat of a

48:05.282 --> 48:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paying any attention to it. And A, are these people just exagger

48:10.554 --> 48:14.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons I don't quite understandif they're not, what is the gove

to prepare for it and to preparefor it?

48:19.330 --> 48:24.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my instinct told me that thegoing to be not much. Not much i

48:25.536 --> 48:27.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nothing is closer to the truth.

48:28.773 --> 48:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You have talked to sincluding the last four heads of

48:36.213 --> 48:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED KOPPEL: Right.

48:37.248 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And did you get a setalking to them, that any one of

48:41.619 --> 48:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what to do if this were to happe

48:43.654 --> 48:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED KOPPEL: Probably not.

48:46.757 --> 48:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Several of them know that the liit happening is great. When I sp

48:52.930 --> 48:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Napolitano just after she left aof homeland security -- and she

48:59.103 --> 49:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the job for five years -- I saiddo you think the chances are of

49:04.141 --> 49:08.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the power grid? She said very80 to 90 percent.

49:10.047 --> 49:14.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems to me inevitable that wdeal with this. But maybe, becau

49:16.086 --> 49:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know what the answer is, we havebegun to do so.

49:19.323 --> 49:21.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have talked to Jewho currently runs Homeland Secu

49:23.093 --> 49:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to be more optimistic curin the job, but it didn't sound

49:27.431 --> 49:27.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation went well.

49:28.999 --> 49:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED KOPPEL: It didn't go well, bthe one hand, he conceded that t

49:34.138 --> 49:37.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a cyber-attack on the power gOn the other hand, when I said,

49:38.576 --> 49:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the plan? You're the secretary osecurity.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He sort of dismissed it and saidlong as you have a radio with ex

49:47.818 --> 49:51.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, yes, but -- so you hand the power goes out and you t

49:52.923 --> 49:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on. What are you going to tell pdoesn't it seem a little strange

49:58.796 --> 50:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to defer telling people whis until after the electricity g

50:04.735 --> 50:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communication is far more difficneeds to be?

50:07.638 --> 50:10.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So it's easy to see a plan, but what would you say t

50:11.508 --> 50:13.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be? Mass evacuations from somManhattan?

50:14.879 --> 50:17.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED KOPPEL: Can't do it. Too manno place to put them.

50:19.416 --> 50:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The only thing -- and I don't waa position of even sounding as t

50:25.356 --> 50:31.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the answers. But I spent three cthe book dealing with the Mormon

50:32.796 --> 50:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reason I focused on the Mormons Mormons, after 200 years of bein

pillar to post, have learned howin difficult situations.

50:45.276 --> 50:50.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are probably about as was any large group in the countr

50:52.082 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the one thing that the Mormons drecommend to Americans in genera

to have a three to six months' sand water.

GWEN IFILL: So, this is not a conecessarily, or a government res

51:08.599 --> 51:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not talking about state actime?

51:11.402 --> 51:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

of mass destruction.

52:06.357 --> 52:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the dangerous thing, Gwen, irequire a government to do it. I

require anyone with a ton of monSomeone sufficiently skilled in

expertise and that the equipmentis available off the shelf. That

52:47.431 --> 52:47.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scary prospect.
