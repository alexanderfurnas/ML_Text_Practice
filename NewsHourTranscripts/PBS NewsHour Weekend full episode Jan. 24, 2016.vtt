04:07.267 --> 04:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPENSIVE, UNNECESSARY, AND

04:08.900 --> 04:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE STILL THERE?

04:55.367 --> 04:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> PEOPLE ARE STILL AT

GUANTANAMO BECAUSE DESPITE

CLOSE IT, CONGRESS WON'T LET HIM

05:02.000 --> 05:04.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AM CONGRESS HAS DECIDED THAT

05:04.467 --> 05:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUANTANAMO SHOULD CONTINUE TO

05:06.133 --> 05:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXIST.

05:06.733 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LIKE

05:07.900 --> 05:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUANTANAMO.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE SYSTEMICALLY

05:11.033 --> 05:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THWARTED HIS EFFORTS TO CLOSE

05:12.767 --> 05:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DETENTION CENTER IN CUBA.

05:16.633 --> 05:19.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSING GUANTANAMO AT THIS STAGE

05:19.167 --> 05:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

05:20.633 --> 05:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIEW IS REALLY MOVING GUANTANAMO

05:23.500 --> 05:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO U.S. SOIL.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA IS NOT TO OPEN THE

05:27.100 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAGES AND LET EVERYBODY GO OR

05:28.533 --> 05:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVE THEM FEDERAL TRIALS AND PUT

05:30.433 --> 05:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM IN FEDERAL DETENTION.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA IS TO PICK UP THE LAST

05:35.133 --> 05:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAINEES AND MOVE THEM TO

05:36.333 --> 05:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY DETENTION IN THE UNITED

05:37.767 --> 05:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE CALL GUANTANAMO NORTH.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSING THE DETENTION CENTER IN

05:43.467 --> 05:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBA AND RECONSTITUTING ON U.S.

05:46.167 --> 05:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOIL.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS SO FAR HAS SYSTEMICALLY

05:49.067 --> 05:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLOCKED THAT VISION.

05:50.567 --> 05:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHY?

05:50.967 --> 05:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS

05:52.433 --> 05:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE IS FEAR THAT FOR SOME

05:55.333 --> 05:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASON THESE ALLEGED TERRORISTS

05:56.800 --> 05:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SCARIER THAN ALL OF THE

05:58.567 --> 06:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGED TERRORISTS-- OR ACTUALLY

06:00.300 --> 06:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONVICTED TERRORISTS IN U.S.

06:02.567 --> 06:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRISONS.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK PART OF IS THAT MEMBERS

06:05.333 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CONGRESS REALLY LIKE THE

06:06.433 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSAGE OF GUANTANAMO.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE MESSAGE OF GUANTANAMO TO

06:09.967 --> 06:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORLD IS MESS WITH US AND

06:10.933 --> 06:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU END UP IN A CAGE AT

06:12.867 --> 06:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUANTANAMO BAY.

06:13.533 --> 06:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ADDITION, THERE IS AMBITION

06:15.067 --> 06:17.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY SOME PEOPLE IN CONGRESS TO

06:17.267 --> 06:17.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROW GUANTANAMO.

06:17.967 --> 06:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LIKE THE IDEA THAT THIS

06:19.467 --> 06:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE AN INTERROGATION

06:21.633 --> 06:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTER.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOSTLY NOBODY WANTS

06:24.833 --> 06:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUANTANAMO IN THEIR BACKYARD.

06:27.267 --> 06:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAVE THE

06:28.667 --> 06:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTCOMES BEEN?

06:29.133 --> 06:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MADE AN INTERESTING

06:30.200 --> 06:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTINCTION.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAID THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

06:32.133 --> 06:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN FEDERALLY CONVICTED IN THE

06:34.333 --> 06:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES OF ACTS OF TERROR

06:36.167 --> 06:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSUS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

06:37.267 --> 06:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE

06:38.667 --> 06:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLY AS LONG AS 14 YEARS.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO WITH THE MOST RAREST OF

06:44.933 --> 06:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCEPTION, THESE ARE NOT

06:46.133 --> 06:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVICTS.

06:46.933 --> 06:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

06:48.233 --> 06:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE WAR PRISONERS.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULD BE IN A MORE

06:51.300 --> 06:52.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADITIONAL WAR, WHAT WE WOULD

06:52.967 --> 06:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER TO BE A PO-W, SOMEONE

06:54.600 --> 06:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS CONSIDERED THE ENEMY,

06:56.233 --> 06:58.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKEN OFF OF THE BATTLE FIELD

06:58.267 --> 06:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HELD UNTIL THE END OF THAT

06:59.967 --> 07:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NEVER

07:03.133 --> 07:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFERRED ON AL-QAEDA, POW

07:06.533 --> 07:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATUS.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CREATED THIS WAR PRISONER

07:08.367 --> 07:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATUS.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS OF THE 91

07:11.567 --> 07:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEN DOWN THERE TODAY, TEN ARE IN

07:13.767 --> 07:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA IS JUST TO HOLD THEM.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO SYSTEMICALLY DECIDE WHEN

07:19.667 --> 07:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN GO.

07:20.433 --> 07:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T REALLY

07:23.500 --> 07:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE NOT ALL

07:25.267 --> 07:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS IN THE CLASSIC

07:26.867 --> 07:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING OF IT.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE FOOT SOLDIERS.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE PICKED

07:30.867 --> 07:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP BY THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE IN

07:34.267 --> 07:38.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AROUND MAZAR IRSHARIF IN

07:38.567 --> 07:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN AND ULTIMATELY

07:39.700 --> 07:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANDED OVER TO THE U.S.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. TROOPS DIDN'T MARCH

07:43.233 --> 07:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO AFGHANISTAN AND TAKE

07:44.300 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRISONERS.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE GAVE THE AMERICANS THESE

07:46.867 --> 07:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRISONERS.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN SOME INSTANCES IN GITMO,

07:49.867 --> 07:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PEOPLE WEREN'T IN

07:50.933 --> 07:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN AT ALL.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE SOME PEOPLE PICK UPPED

07:55.567 --> 07:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP IN THAILAND, MANY IN

07:56.767 --> 07:57.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAKISTAN.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT A BATTLE FIELD

07:59.367 --> 08:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROUNDUP OF PRISONERS OF WAR.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY ARE WAR PRISONERS.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE NOT ACCUSED, WITH SOME

08:04.900 --> 08:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCEPTIONS, OF BEING CRIMINALS.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

08:08.433 --> 08:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS CONVICTED AND SITTING

08:09.433 --> 08:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FEDERAL DETENTION HERE.

08:10.967 --> 08:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS WHY THE IDEA IS TO BRING

08:12.100 --> 08:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM TO THIS COUNTRY FOR

08:13.667 --> 08:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY DETENTION, NOT FEDERAL

08:16.833 --> 08:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOCKUP.

08:17.933 --> 08:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SOME OF THEM

08:18.800 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ALSO BEEN CLEARED FOR

08:20.233 --> 08:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASE BUT THEY'RE STILL THERE.

08:21.933 --> 08:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST FEW

08:23.767 --> 08:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS, WE'VE SEEN ONE COUNTRY

08:25.333 --> 08:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKES A COUPLE HERE AND A FEW

THERE AND AT SOME POINT THERE

08:28.267 --> 08:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE 15 THAT WENT IN ONE

08:29.667 --> 08:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTION.

08:30.633 --> 08:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

08:31.933 --> 08:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN CLEARED MAYBE FIVE OR SIX

08:34.133 --> 08:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO TO BE RELEASED.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
26 COUNTRIES HAVE TAKEN IN

08:38.100 --> 08:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T GO HOME.

08:39.533 --> 08:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN

08:40.733 --> 08:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARING ABOUT LATELY IS RECENTLY

08:42.867 --> 08:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO MEN WERE SENT TO THE BALANCE

08:44.333 --> 08:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANS.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WE

08:46.833 --> 08:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULDN'T SEND BACK WERE FROM

08:49.300 --> 08:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEMEN.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE

08:51.533 --> 08:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSH ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THEM

08:52.767 --> 08:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE A POLICY DECISION THAT

08:54.633 --> 08:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEMENI DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO

08:56.600 --> 08:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD NOT GO HOME.

08:57.867 --> 09:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FEARED THAT THEY WOULD BE

09:01.867 --> 09:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTERING THIS DESTABILIZED

09:02.767 --> 09:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY WITH A POWERFUL AL-QAEDA

09:05.067 --> 09:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANCHISE AND THAT THERE WOULD

09:05.933 --> 09:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE WHAT THEY CALL REENGAGEMENT

09:07.967 --> 09:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO BACK TO

09:09.500 --> 09:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMAL LIVES AND SETTLE DOWN, IS

09:11.700 --> 09:12.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOPE.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO AND HAVE

09:13.667 --> 09:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES AND GET ON WITH THEIR

09:14.633 --> 09:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVES.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IN YEMEN THE ODDS WERE THEY

09:17.033 --> 09:19.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE DRAWN BACK TO AL-QAEDA

09:19.167 --> 09:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ATTRACTING AMERICAN TARGETS.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TELL ME ABOUT

09:22.300 --> 09:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED WAZIR.

09:23.833 --> 09:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING.

09:24.833 --> 09:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS

09:25.700 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS OFFERED SANCTUARY IN A

09:27.733 --> 09:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIRD COUNTRY THAT HIS LAWYER

09:30.700 --> 09:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT WAS A GREAT COUNTRY FOR

09:33.233 --> 09:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESETTLEMENT, THAT WAS A GREAT

09:34.333 --> 09:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANCE FOR HIM.

09:35.767 --> 09:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE SAID MOHAMMED WAZIR IS

09:39.000 --> 09:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRAID.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS BEEN THERE SO LONG HE

09:41.900 --> 09:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEARS THE UNKNOWN.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE HAD BEEN INSISTING THAT

09:46.200 --> 09:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ONLY WANTED TO GO TO A

09:47.733 --> 09:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY WHERE HIS MOM WAS, HIS

09:49.867 --> 09:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROTHERS WERE OR HIS AUNTS AND

09:52.300 --> 09:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCLES WERE.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S THE U.A.A.,

09:56.367 --> 09:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDONESIA, AND SAUDI ARABIA.

09:57.433 --> 09:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE COUNTRY THAT AGREED TO

09:58.767 --> 10:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE HIM IN ONE NONE OF THOSE.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE COULDN'T BRING HIMSELF TO

10:02.567 --> 10:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET ON A PLANE AND START HIS NEW

10:04.100 --> 10:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

10:05.533 --> 10:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

10:06.867 --> 10:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS IS SUCH A STRANGE THING

10:09.600 --> 10:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING

10:10.867 --> 10:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE LAWYER THAT THE

10:13.867 --> 10:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEMENIS IN PARTICULAR WILL GO

10:15.100 --> 10:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYWHERE, THEY ARE SO DESPERATE

10:16.300 --> 10:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET OFF GUANTANAMO THEY WILL

10:17.733 --> 10:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO ANYWHERE.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MAN WOULDN'T GET ON A

10:19.667 --> 10:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANE.

10:20.467 --> 10:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS THEIR

10:21.400 --> 10:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFE LIKE AFTER THEY GO

10:22.767 --> 10:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHERE.

10:23.433 --> 10:24.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T THEY JUST DECIDE TO LEAVE

10:24.267 --> 10:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE COUNTRIES AND TRY TO MAKE

10:25.733 --> 10:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WAY BACK TO WHEREVER THEIR

10:27.000 --> 10:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOME IS.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE DEAL THAT THE U.S. MAKES

10:28.700 --> 10:30.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY PUBLIC.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT

10:34.033 --> 10:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTITLED TO TRAVEL PAPERS, AT

10:35.233 --> 10:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST FOR A YEAR.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME INSTANCES FOR TWO YEARS.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO A

10:40.233 --> 10:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REHABILITATION CENTRE, SOMETHING

10:41.633 --> 10:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S GOING TO GET THEM BACK

10:43.433 --> 10:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO SOCIETY.

10:44.433 --> 10:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A NEW SOCIETY, IN SOME

10:47.067 --> 10:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTANCES, YOU KNOW, THEY GIVE

10:49.133 --> 10:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM A NEW LANGUAGE.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME IN URUGUAY,

10:52.967 --> 10:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT JUST ARRIVED IN OMAN.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME

10:57.033 --> 10:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINESE-- CITIZENS OF CHINA

10:58.133 --> 10:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUSLIM LEADERS WHO WERE SENT TO

10:59.867 --> 11:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PALAU.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND

11:02.333 --> 11:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OFFER

11:03.433 --> 11:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PACKAGES.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NO, THE DESIGN OF THIS

11:05.300 --> 11:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRAM IS FOR THEM NOT TO BE

11:06.733 --> 11:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO JUMP ON THE FIRST PLANE

11:07.867 --> 11:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GO TO YEMEN.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: PART OF THE

11:10.567 --> 11:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASON YOU GO DOWN SO REGULARLY

11:12.167 --> 11:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS TO COVER THE TRIAL.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THEM IS THE 9/11 TRIAL

11:14.967 --> 11:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS STILL GOING.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE HEARINGS, PRETRIAL

11:17.300 --> 11:17.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARINGS.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO

11:19.233 --> 11:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTABLISH HOW THERE WILL BE A

11:21.267 --> 11:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIAL OF FIVE MEN WHO WERE

11:24.233 --> 11:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPTURED IN 2002 AND 2003 AND

11:27.100 --> 11:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKEN OFF TO THE BLACK-- OF THE

11:31.267 --> 11:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIA, WHERE THEY WERE NOT GIVEN

11:32.933 --> 11:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCESS TO THE RED CROSS, WHERE

11:33.967 --> 11:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO WHAT IS

11:35.567 --> 11:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW CONSIDERED TO BE TORTURE.

11:37.267 --> 11:38.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN DROPPED AT GUANTANAMO

11:38.967 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2006 FOR TRIAL.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAR COURT THAT WAS CREATED

11:42.633 --> 11:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER

11:44.600 --> 11:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
9/11 IS STILL TRYING TO WORK ON

11:47.533 --> 11:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW IT WILL HOLD THAT TRIAL.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE

11:50.567 --> 11:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT WHAT CONSTITUTES LEGITIMATE

11:52.033 --> 11:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SAY DEATH PENALTY TRIAL.

11:54.767 --> 11:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THEY HAVE LEARNED

11:57.233 --> 11:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNSEL, CIVILIAN DEFENSE

11:58.767 --> 12:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DEFENSES.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ATTACK

12:08.433 --> 12:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTEGRITY OF THIS COURT THAT

12:09.833 --> 12:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:47.367 --> 13:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS VISIONARY WORK THAT WAS

13:57.967 --> 13:58.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO TOGETHER THESE

13:58.967 --> 14:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PUT 60 TO 90

14:02.633 --> 14:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMERAS EACH IN 17 FORESTS ALL

14:05.067 --> 14:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THE WORLD.

14:06.000 --> 14:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S 15 DIFFERENT

COUNTRIES.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EACH OF THESE CAMERA SHOTS

14:09.733 --> 14:11.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EACH OF THESE SITES IS USING

14:11.267 --> 14:12.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME APPROACH.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE HAVE THIS SYSTEMIC WAY TO

14:14.167 --> 14:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANALYZE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THESE

14:16.167 --> 14:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:18.033 --> 14:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THESE PHOTOS ARE PRETTY

14:19.767 --> 14:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLE.

14:20.933 --> 14:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE

14:22.700 --> 14:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIES WE RARELY SEE IN PERSON,

14:24.233 --> 14:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT RIGHT?

14:25.000 --> 14:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST

14:27.700 --> 14:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELUSIVE ANIMALS OUT THERE THAT

14:28.733 --> 14:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF WE WERE HAVING PEOPLE WALK

14:29.933 --> 14:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE FOREST AND TRY TO

14:32.133 --> 14:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVEY WHAT'S THERE, VERY

14:33.467 --> 14:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNLIKELY WOULD THEY SEE THESE

14:34.633 --> 14:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANIMALS.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THAT'S WHY THESE CAMERAS

14:37.200 --> 14:38.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE A REALLY SPECIAL GLIMPSE

14:38.967 --> 14:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THESE

14:40.667 --> 14:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CAPTURE ON CAMERA.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, ANY OF THE CHARISMATIC

14:47.633 --> 14:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE CATS, FOR INSTANCE, LIKE

14:49.567 --> 14:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAG WARS AND LEOPARDS THAT LIVE

14:51.200 --> 14:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FORESTS THAT ARE

14:54.100 --> 14:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLY ELUSIVE AND HARD

14:55.067 --> 14:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SIGHT.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE SOME NICE SIGHTING OF

14:58.833 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RARE BUSH DOGS IN SOUTH AMERICA

15:00.767 --> 15:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE JUST-- IT'S HARD TO

15:02.433 --> 15:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW IF THEY ARE IN A PROTECTED

15:03.733 --> 15:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREA OR NOT.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE CAMERAS LET US KNOW

15:05.767 --> 15:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE THERE WHICH IS

15:06.867 --> 15:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT NEWS.

15:07.933 --> 15:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES IT TELL

15:08.733 --> 15:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US GENERALLY THOUGH ABOUT HOW

15:10.433 --> 15:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED AREAS ARE MAYBE DOING

15:11.533 --> 15:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GOOD JOB OF PROTECTING

15:12.567 --> 15:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILDLIFE?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, PROTECTED AREAS, EVEN

15:15.133 --> 15:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH THEY HAVE THEIR

15:16.567 --> 15:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAKNESSES, GENERALLY SUSTAIN

15:17.667 --> 15:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HABITAT THAT THESE ANIMALS

15:19.067 --> 15:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK, FOR

15:21.433 --> 15:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, ON GOGGLE EARTH, YOU

15:23.433 --> 15:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN OFTEN SEE A PROTECTED AREA

15:25.733 --> 15:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE

15:27.267 --> 15:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSCAPE AROUND IT WHERE A LOT

15:28.833 --> 15:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF FORESTS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED

15:31.067 --> 15:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO, FOR INSTANCE, AGRICULTURE OR

15:32.900 --> 15:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HAVING THESE AREAS THAT

15:35.433 --> 15:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAINTAIN THE HABITAT IS REALLY

15:36.833 --> 15:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT FOR WILDLIFE.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: IT TELLS US A LOT

15:39.267 --> 15:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

15:40.667 --> 15:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:42.433 --> 15:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPROTECTED AREAS OF THE WORLD.

15:44.133 --> 15:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

15:44.967 --> 15:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE'RE SEEING FROM THIS FIRST

15:46.500 --> 15:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSESSMENT THAT THESE PROTECTED

15:48.167 --> 15:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS, AT LEAST FOR NOW, ARE

15:49.867 --> 15:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOWING GOOD NEWS.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT'S NOT THE FINAL WORD.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S JUST THE FIRST WORD FOR THE

15:54.467 --> 15:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM NETWORK.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE ALSO WANT TO DO IS

15:57.000 --> 15:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPARE TO OUTSIDE PROTECTED

15:58.233 --> 15:58.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS.

15:58.867 --> 16:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT

16:01.000 --> 16:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STABILITY WOULDN'T BE THE CASE.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE ARE THREATS LIKE

16:04.433 --> 16:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSION OF FOREST AREAS TO

16:07.833 --> 16:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ILLEGAL HUNTING, AND OTHER KINDS

16:11.233 --> 16:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF HUMAN INFLUENCES THAT WE

16:13.167 --> 16:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD EXPECT THAT THE WILDLIFE

OUTSIDE OF THE PROTECTED AREAS

16:16.100 --> 16:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PROBABLY NOT DOING AS WELL AS
