global tensions.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:16.550 --> 00:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We are here to celebrate
history.

00:19.086 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Neil Gorsuch
is sworn in
as an associate Supreme Court
justice, how

00:24.858 --> 00:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the newest member may tip the
scales in some
key upcoming cases.

00:30.564 --> 00:36.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fighting corruption with
education -- how
one university in Ghana
incorporates ethics

00:36.870 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courses to help guide the next
generation
of Africa's leaders.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH, President, Ashesi
University:
We need a lot of innovation.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need people who are trained
to drive that.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need people who are going
to be working
on the government side.

00:50.317 --> 00:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.392 --> 01:01.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.295 --> 01:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Neil Gorsuch has
been sworn
in as the 113th Supreme Court
justice.

01:13.106 --> 01:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 49-year-old former appeals
court judge
fills the nearly 14-month
vacancy created

01:18.946 --> 01:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the death of Antonin Scalia,
and it restores
the court's conservative
majority.

01:23.951 --> 01:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a White House Rose Garden
ceremony,
Gorsuch received praise from
President Trump,

01:29.489 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and took the second of two
oaths, this one
administered by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, for

01:35.195 --> 01:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whom Gorsuch once served as
clerk.

01:37.030 --> 01:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Associate Justice:
And to the American people, I am
humbled by

01:43.270 --> 01:46.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the trust placed in me today.

01:46.106 --> 01:51.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will never forget that to whom
much is given,
much will be expected.

01:51.578 --> 01:57.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I promise you that I will do
all my powers
permit to be a faithful servant
of the Constitution

01:57.584 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and laws of this great nation.

01:59.453 --> 02:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will take
a closer look
at the impact Justice Gorsuch
could have on

02:04.291 --> 02:07.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the high court a little later in
the program.

02:07.594 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, there's
word the
governor of Alabama, Robert
Bentley, is resigning

02:12.799 --> 02:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amid allegations he used state
resources to
hide a romantic affair with an
aide.

02:19.072 --> 02:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jail records in Montgomery
County showed that
Bentley was booked today on two
campaign and

02:24.277 --> 02:25.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ethics charges.

02:25.679 --> 02:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alabama's lieutenant governor,
Kay Ivey, is
expected to succeed him.

02:30.851 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don Dailey, who is the host of
Alabama Public
TV's "Capital Journal," has been
following

02:35.422 --> 02:36.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the story.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don Dailey, thank you for being
here.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us what the governor is
accused of.

02:40.961 --> 02:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON DAILEY, Alabama Public TV:
All these charges,
as you mentioned, relate to his
alleged inappropriate

02:45.732 --> 02:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship with his former top
political
aide, Rebekah Mason.

02:49.770 --> 02:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The legislature here a year ago
initiated
impeachment articles against the
governor.

02:54.608 --> 02:59.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a matter of fact,
hearings in those
articles of impeachment started
today, while,

02:59.446 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time, officials were
behind closed
doors negotiating a resignation
deal with

03:05.419 --> 03:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Bentley under which he
would plead
to lesser charges, thus the
campaign finance

03:10.724 --> 03:12.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
charges that you talked about.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the governor
has denied
this for the longest time.

03:15.562 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

03:16.563 --> 03:17.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DON DAILEY: He has.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has denied any wrongdoing.

03:20.267 --> 03:25.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that he and his former
top political
aide never had a physical
affair, that he

03:25.305 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made inappropriate remarks to
her, and he
apologized for those a year ago.

03:29.876 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has also insisted that he has
done nothing
illegal in the furtherance of
that alleged

03:35.449 --> 03:37.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
affair.

03:37.150 --> 03:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And since it came
out so many
months ago, why, Don Dailey, has
it taken

03:41.354 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this long to get to this point?

03:43.323 --> 03:46.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON DAILEY: Alabama has never
impeached a
governor.

03:46.326 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there has never been
but one other
impeachment process against a
constitutional

03:50.363 --> 03:51.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officer in 100 years.

03:52.032 --> 03:56.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once these articles of
impeachment were
brought, the legislature
basically had to

03:56.970 --> 03:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
create the process from scratch.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It began doing that about a year
ago.

04:01.341 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It then hired a special counsel
to investigate
the charges against the
governor.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was finally ready to
present those
findings in the hearings that
started today.

04:08.882 --> 04:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so the
governor was actually
booked in a county jail today on
these ethics

04:14.488 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charges?

04:16.256 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON DAILEY: He had to go to the
Montgomery
County Jail to be booked and
fingerprinted

04:19.759 --> 04:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on these misdemeanor charges as
part of the
process, and then he was
expected to go over

04:24.431 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Capitol and meet the
press, where he
was formally expected to resign.

04:28.668 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the reaction
of Alabama
citizens so far?

04:32.973 --> 04:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON DAILEY: Alabama citizens, by
and large,
have been clamoring for a
resolution to this

04:38.245 --> 04:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one way or the other for quite
some time,
at least according to a lot of
lawmakers that

04:42.315 --> 04:44.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have spoken with.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last 24 hours, both the
heads of the
Alabama House and Senate have
also called

04:47.954 --> 04:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Bentley to step down.

04:49.689 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Don Dailey with
Alabama Public
Television, we thank you very
much.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON DAILEY: Thank you, Judy.

04:55.896 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, a state
of emergency
has gone into effect in Egypt,

Palm Sunday suicide bombings at
two Coptic
Christian churches.

through the

began burying

05:16.950 --> 05:18.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their loved ones.

05:18.285 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the deadliest day for
Egyptian Christians
in decades.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Korean Peninsula.

05:29.496 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The comments come after a U.S.
Navy strike
group moved closer to the area
over the weekend,

05:34.901 --> 05:36.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a show of force.

Ministry spokesman
called for dialogue in

nuclear and weapons activities.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through

05:46.880 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been paying close attention
to the development
of the situation on the Korean
Peninsula.

05:52.152 --> 05:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think that, under current
conditions, the
parties involved should exercise
restraint,

05:57.224 --> 06:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and should avoid conducting
activities that
will deteriorate and escalate
difficulties

06:01.928 --> 06:03.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this region.

08:45.992 --> 08:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes 18 years after he
joined the professional
golf tour.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congratulations.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
former Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral Mike

08:56.669 --> 09:02.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mullen on the day's global hot
spots; how
the newest justice is likely to
change the

09:02.442 --> 09:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court; a new top dog
among U.S. automakers;
and much more.

09:12.485 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court; a new top dog
among U.S. automakers;
and much more.

09:19.659 --> 09:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we return to the U.S.
missile strikes
on Syria and what the Trump
administration's

09:24.497 --> 09:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
options for dealing with that
now-six-year-old
civil war.

09:28.835 --> 09:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, begins our coverage.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: We
rededicate ourselves to holding
to account

09:36.509 --> 09:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any and all who commit crimes
against the
innocents anywhere in the world.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson
made that vow today at a
memorial ceremony

09:46.586 --> 09:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for victims of a Nazi massacre.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke ahead of a G7 meeting
in Italy.

09:52.559 --> 09:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His message came just days after
dozens of
U.S. cruise missiles struck a
Syrian air base

09:58.598 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in response to another massacre,
a chemical
attack that killed more than 80
people in

10:04.337 --> 10:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rebel-held Idlib province.

10:07.474 --> 10:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria dominated today's summit,
and all eyes
were on Tillerson for clues as
to what the

10:12.779 --> 10:14.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. plans to do next.

10:14.547 --> 10:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. Foreign Minister,
are (INAUDIBLE)
the U.S. and its position on
Assad?

10:20.386 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Those questions
came after
Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador
Nikki Haley

10:25.658 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeared to send mixed messages
yesterday
about U.S. policy on Syria going
forward,

10:32.298 --> 10:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most notably on the future of
Syrian President
Bashar al- Assad.

10:37.437 --> 10:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson told CBS' "Face the
Nation" that
defeating the Islamic State, not
removing

10:43.142 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Assad, remained the top
priority.

10:45.211 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Once the ISIS
threat has been
reduced or eliminated, I think
we can turn

10:51.284 --> 10:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our attention directly to
stabilizing the
situation in Syria.

10:55.021 --> 11:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are hopeful that we can
prevent a continuation
of the civil war, and that we
can bring the

11:00.159 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parties to the table to begin
the process
of political discussions.

11:05.231 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, that requires the
participation of
the regime, with the support of
their allies.

11:11.037 --> 11:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But Haley
seemed to suggest
otherwise on CNN's "STATE OF THE
UNION."

11:15.375 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United
Nations: There's not any sort of
option where

11:17.777 --> 11:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a political solution is going to
happen with
Assad at the head of the regime.

11:20.647 --> 11:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, regime change is something
that we think
is going to happen, because all
of the parties

11:25.919 --> 11:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to see that Assad is
not the leader
that needs to be taking place
for Syria.

11:29.222 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today in
Washington, White
House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer tried to

11:33.526 --> 11:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
square the two statements.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I can't imagine a stable and
peaceful Syria

11:39.599 --> 11:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where Bashar al-Assad is in
power.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there can be a multipronged
approach.

11:45.805 --> 11:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are ensuring that ISIS is
contained and
there is a de-escalation of the
proliferation

11:50.877 --> 11:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of chemical weapons at the same
time creating
the environment for a change in
leadership.

11:57.283 --> 12:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Spicer also
raised the possibility
of U.S. military action against
Assad for

12:03.256 --> 12:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
use of conventional weapons.

12:05.024 --> 12:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: If you gas a baby,
if you put
a barrel bomb into innocent
people, I think

12:10.730 --> 12:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can -- you will see a
response from this
president.

12:13.633 --> 12:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson, who
has charged
that Syria's principal backer,
Russia, was

12:18.037 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either -- quote -- "complicit or
simply incompetent"
in Syria's use of chemical
weapons, heads

12:24.043 --> 12:26.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Moscow for meetings
Wednesday.

12:26.546 --> 12:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will meet with Foreign
Minister Sergei
Lavrov, but not, the Kremlin
announced today,

12:32.552 --> 12:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with President Vladimir Putin.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

12:37.757 --> 12:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a statement
this afternoon,
U.S. Defense Secretary James
Mattis said Friday's

12:42.795 --> 12:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. missile strike damaged or
destroyed 20
percent of Syria's operational
aircraft, and

12:48.801 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that jets could no longer refuel
or rearm
at that base.

12:53.006 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on U.S. options in
Syria, relations
with Russia and the ongoing
crisis with North

12:58.611 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea, I sat down a short time
ago with retired
Admiral Mike Mullen.

13:02.348 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs
of Staff from 2007 to 2011.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syria, first of all.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was the U.S. strike on that
airfield justified?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN, Former Joints
Chiefs Chairman:
I think it was justified.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it sent a pretty strong
message that
the use of chemical weapons,
which are banned

13:20.133 --> 13:23.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
globally, is not to be
tolerated.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that was the main
message.

13:25.972 --> 13:31.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What has been a little
surprising to me, anyway,
is to find out through media
that there actually

13:31.411 --> 13:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been several chemical
attacks recently.

13:35.114 --> 13:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, with some belief on my
part, and I think
a lot of people, that we thought
we got rid

13:40.787 --> 13:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the chemical weapons with the
regime that
President Obama and President
Putin put in

13:46.893 --> 13:48.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a bit of a surprise, but
I think we
have to send the message that
this is unacceptable.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that
message has
been received?

13:54.567 --> 13:55.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you think this
accomplished?

13:55.802 --> 13:56.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: I think the
message has been
received.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was really focused on
that.

14:00.807 --> 14:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I certainly have seen the
discussion that,
after the fact, that that air
base was back

14:06.446 --> 14:08.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in operations.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That didn't surprise me, but I
thought it
was proportional, which I think
is important.

14:11.617 --> 14:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was focused on the air force,
which has
been barrel bombing its people,
you know,

14:16.255 --> 14:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for some time, and, in that
regard, a pretty
strong message.

14:20.226 --> 14:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will it, in fact, be absorbed by
Assad and
others?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's what we're going
to have to
wait and see.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it
means that
if Assad uses chemical weapons
again, the

14:33.239 --> 14:34.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. will strike again?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: I don't know the
answer to
that.

14:37.610 --> 14:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, you know, from where
I sit, there's
an expectation that, if he
continues, obviously,

14:41.414 --> 14:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he will continue to pay a price
for that.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so we will see.

14:47.453 --> 14:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just such a tragedy to see
what he has
done to his own countrymen, you
know, the

14:52.959 --> 14:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians, the women, the
children, and just
the visible images of that
chemical strike.

14:58.664 --> 15:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think -- I think, in the
long run,
he loses if he continues to do
that.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How that happens, what the --
I'm not really
sure.

15:06.239 --> 15:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is it clear
to you, Admiral
Mullen, what the priority of the
Trump administration

15:11.944 --> 15:13.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is now toward Syria?

15:13.312 --> 15:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it mainly to continue the
fight against
ISIS?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it more now against President
Assad?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think many people are having
difficulty
understanding.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: Well, I think --
and I thought
General McMaster yesterday on
the Sunday show

15:27.960 --> 15:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was excellent in sort of framing
it, that
there is going to be some of
both, clearly.

15:34.267 --> 15:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The priority, it seems to me, is
ISIS, and
that was used for justification
for this attack,

15:39.438 --> 15:46.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in terms of supporting,
fighting ISIS,
and responding to the use of
chemical weapons.

15:46.913 --> 15:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My own personal view is, I
think, you know,
in the long run -- and I don't
know how long

15:50.516 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is, but I think it's a
while -- that
Assad doesn't have much of a
future in that

15:56.088 --> 15:57.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

15:57.256 --> 16:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worry a little bit about --
quote -- "regime
change."

16:00.893 --> 16:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't had a great deal of
success with
that in years.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's just really difficult.

16:06.532 --> 16:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, I think it's a strong
message,
at least from the Trump
administration, that

16:10.369 --> 16:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're not going to tolerate his
continuing
to certainly use these weapons.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will see where it goes
with respect
to the rest of Syria.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Associated Press is
reporting this afternoon
that, quoting a U.S. official as
saying they

16:24.550 --> 16:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now have concluded that Russia
knew about
that chemical weapons attack
before it happened,

16:29.488 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they may even have gone in
and bombed
the location of the attack in
order to hide

16:33.960 --> 16:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evidence that chemical weapons
were used.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that's the case, what can the
U.S. do about
it?

16:39.899 --> 16:41.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: Well, I think
just the strike
itself, our strike itself was a
pretty strong

16:44.937 --> 16:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signal to Russia in terms of
starting to draw
a line, if you will, in the sand
that there

16:53.713 --> 16:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are limits, first of all.

16:55.648 --> 17:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, I think it undermines
the use of
chemical weapons, certain
weapons, certainly

17:00.519 --> 17:01.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
undermined Putin.

17:01.821 --> 17:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know Secretary Tillerson is on
his way to
Moscow this week.

17:05.658 --> 17:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I expect -- I mean, I don't
know for a
fact, but I expect he will carry
a very strong

17:10.730 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
message to Russia.

17:13.599 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McMaster yesterday talked about
he thought
it was important that Russia, in
fact, asked

17:19.939 --> 17:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves what they're doing
and what they
hope to accomplish.

17:22.208 --> 17:29.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a considerable
amount of press
on deconflicting the U.S. and
Russia.

17:29.115 --> 17:34.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that will continue,
even though
Russia has called it off, per
se.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You think what
will continue?

17:35.254 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: I think the
deconfliction
between the forces will
continue, although

17:38.257 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a pretty mixed battlefield
on the ground.

17:41.827 --> 17:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect that the militaries
will figure
out a way to continue to do
that.

17:46.632 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think there's -- in the
long term, the
solution in Syria is politically
driven.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I put it in two big pieces.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is, we have to stop the
killing.

17:57.209 --> 18:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other is, we need to let
the refugees
-- we need to let Syrian
citizens go home.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that was part
of my question.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Can it be done?

18:05.418 --> 18:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can progress be made without
Russian participation
and Russian agreement?

18:09.455 --> 18:10.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MULLEN: No.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have believed for years that
Russia was
going to be part of the solution
even before

18:14.460 --> 18:15.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they went in.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, it became much more
evidence when
they did go in.

18:19.532 --> 18:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think there is any
way that this
can be solved without the U.S.
and Russia

18:25.004 --> 18:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting together and figuring
out politically
what the solution is.

18:28.874 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's going to be a need to
include other
political leaders in the region,
but certainly

18:32.878 --> 18:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and Russia are the two
key ones.

18:35.648 --> 18:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Admiral
Mullen, North
Korea, right now, there is a
U.S. carrier

18:39.518 --> 18:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group on the way to the Korean
Peninsula,
in the wake of North Korean
missile tests.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MULLEN: Yes.

18:48.728 --> 18:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were part
of a Council
on Foreign Relations report some
months ago

18:53.499 --> 18:58.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying that the next
administration had to
make getting China involved in
dealing with

18:58.337 --> 19:00.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
North Korea a priority.

19:00.806 --> 19:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it your sense that the
administration is
-- this administration is doing
that successfully?

19:06.212 --> 19:07.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that happening?

19:07.279 --> 19:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And do you think the Chinese can
make a difference?

19:09.248 --> 19:10.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: I think the
Chinese can make
a huge difference.

19:12.485 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, if they don't, and
without them,
that the options are pretty
drastic and pretty

19:19.492 --> 19:21.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bad pretty quickly.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I do think the Trump
administration has taken
a more regular approach.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see reported that there have
been National
Security Council meetings on
this, so there

19:29.935 --> 19:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly is a planning process
which is going
on.

19:32.605 --> 19:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the message from the
president, the
North Korean leadership, and the
rest of the

19:37.143 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world is that there are limits
on what he's
going to tolerate.

19:41.580 --> 19:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was clearly priority
message in his meeting
with Xi Jinping, President Xi
Jinping, from

19:46.719 --> 19:49.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
China on Thursday.

19:49.288 --> 19:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of those steps, I think, are
positive
in, again, what is an enormously
complex problem.

19:55.694 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got nuclear weapons that
are buried deeply,
that are very difficult to
impossible to hit.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's emerging on more and more
capability.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the longer -- this is a very
tough solution
set, no matter what you do.

20:11.310 --> 20:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do believe, the longer we
wait, the
more challenging the solution
set becomes.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The longer the
U.S. waits to
do what?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

20:21.921 --> 20:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: The longer we
wait to take
some sort of action, whether
it's negotiations

20:26.158 --> 20:32.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or some kind of military
operation, depending
on what the president would
choose, the more

20:32.098 --> 20:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult those solution sets
will become,
back to where you -- where they
started, from

20:37.603 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the perspective of this solution
must go through
Beijing.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to incentivize Beijing
to do this.

20:45.111 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to figure out, if we
can, how to incentivize
the leadership in North Korea,
if there is

20:49.949 --> 20:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a possibility to do that -- and
I'm not sure
it is -- to avoid what will be a
potentially

20:55.754 --> 21:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drastic capability that allows
that very uncertain
leader in North Korea the
ability to strike

21:03.796 --> 21:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States of America
with a nuclear
weapon.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Serious problems
in all these
directions.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: There are.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Admiral Mike
Mullen, we thank
you very much for coming by.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

21:15.641 --> 21:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MULLEN: Thanks, Judy.

21:21.947 --> 21:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the domestic
front, as we
reported, the Supreme Court
today welcomed

21:28.787 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its newest member, Neil Gorsuch,
who brings
the court back to its full
compliment of nine

21:34.660 --> 21:35.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
justices.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown takes it from
there.

21:37.563 --> 21:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now that he's
officially Justice
Gorsuch, we confront the
question of how he

21:41.700 --> 21:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might influence the high court
and its work
going forward.

21:44.770 --> 21:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that, we turn, as we
always do, to
Marcia Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent

21:50.009 --> 21:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for "The National Law Journal."

21:51.944 --> 21:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Marcia, on one hand you have
a conservative
justice replacing another
conservative justice,

21:57.416 --> 21:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so you wouldn't expect major
ideological shifts.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, that's right, Jeff.

22:01.820 --> 22:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is true that Justice
Gorsuch will
not change the conservative
direction of the

22:08.727 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court, but that doesn't
mean that
his vote is going to be
insignificant.

22:13.899 --> 22:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we saw that just
last term, for
example, with Justice Scalia's
death.

22:19.838 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court split 4-4 in a major
immigration
case affecting millions of
people.

22:26.545 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also divided 4-4 in a major
labor union
case affecting thousands of
union and non-union

22:33.519 --> 22:34.486 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which may well
come back.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.

22:37.489 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an agenda case on the part
of a conservative
organization that already is
pushing another

22:42.461 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
case toward the Supreme Court.

22:44.597 --> 22:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this court has been divided
ideologically,
and Justice Gorsuch will play a
role in the

22:51.370 --> 22:53.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcome of some very important
cases.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and
let's look at
some of them.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most immediately would be even
this week,
right, where he for the first
time takes part

22:59.011 --> 23:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that decision-making of which
cases will
go forward.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices will meet Thursday
in a private
conference.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they go over petitions that
have been
submitted to the court in which
parties are

23:12.024 --> 23:14.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asking the court to hear their
case.

23:14.793 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are actually two
petitions that
he may play an important role in
whether the

23:20.633 --> 23:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court takes or doesn't take
them.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is a case from his home
state, Colorado.

23:25.804 --> 23:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It involves a baker who feels
that it's against
his religious beliefs to bake a
cake for a

23:32.811 --> 23:34.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gay couple's wedding.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That one got a
lot of attention
early on, right?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It did.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's been hanging in the
court since early
December.

23:39.285 --> 23:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're not quite sure what
the court plans
to do with it.

23:43.188 --> 23:47.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then another case,
interesting case, out
of California involves the
Second Amendment

23:48.027 --> 23:56.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and California's law that
requires a very
good reason for you to have a
concealed carry

23:56.502 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gun, a permit for that.

23:58.671 --> 24:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and
then, next week,
he starts hearing cases for the
first time,

24:02.141 --> 24:03.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the biggest
one next week
is a church and state separation
case out

24:07.680 --> 24:09.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Missouri.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right, and
it involves
Trinity Lutheran Church of
Missouri, which

24:12.751 --> 24:19.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is challenging an amendment to
Missouri's
constitution, state
constitution, that prohibits

24:19.792 --> 24:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
direct and indirect support of
religious organizations
and institutions.

24:26.632 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trinity Lutheran Church operates
a playground,
day care center, and it wanted
to participate

24:32.338 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a state grant program that
allows organizations
to refurbish playgrounds with
recycled tires.

24:40.612 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Trinity Lutheran was turned
down because
it is a religious institution.

24:44.983 --> 24:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's claiming that that state
constitutional
amendment violates our First
Amendment free

24:51.357 --> 24:53.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exercise of religion clause.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
then we start
to look at the longer term.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even as I say that, I
realize he's a younger
man, so the longer term for him
could be a

25:00.099 --> 25:01.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very long time, right?

25:01.900 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the more -- the closer
long term, one
of the possible cases would be,
well, for

25:09.007 --> 25:12.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
example, Donald Trump's
immigration case,
right?

25:12.544 --> 25:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Immigration.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right, the executive order on
immigration.

25:15.514 --> 25:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is percolating in a number
of courts
around the country, federal
appellate courts

25:20.719 --> 25:23.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that could rule soon.

25:23.756 --> 25:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think some of them are
hearing arguments
in May.

25:27.359 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may see decisions from those
courts this
summer, depending on the urgency
of the government

25:33.465 --> 25:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in getting the Supreme Court to
take a look
at this.

25:36.034 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the government loses, or if
the other side
loses, either way, that's going
to get to

25:41.306 --> 25:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court, undoubtedly.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just in our last
minute, let
me put you on the spot a little
bit.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have talked about this in the
past.

25:47.513 --> 25:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we have -- we just went
through a
process with a lot of questions
about impact

25:51.250 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Senate, right, of going
through the
so-called nuclear option.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

25:56.021 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But also lasting
questions
about impact on the court itself
-- a partisan

25:59.124 --> 26:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country, a polarized country.

26:02.194 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what degree can we say that
this has had
any impact that you might see
about a polarized,

26:08.667 --> 26:09.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
partisan court?

26:10.002 --> 26:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: This court is
ideologically
divided right now.

26:13.572 --> 26:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether it's partisan may depend
on your point
of view.

26:17.075 --> 26:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tend to think that ideology is
stronger
here than any desire to reach
decisions in

26:25.551 --> 26:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order to benefit a particular
political party.

26:28.854 --> 26:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it all comes down to
eventually, Jeff,
is that presidential elections
are very important,

26:34.159 --> 26:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if you agree with what the
court is doing,
the justices and the majority,
or you don't,

26:41.834 --> 26:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you really have to pay attention
to who you
elect as president.

26:44.803 --> 26:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marcia Coyle of
"The National
Law Journal," thank you, as
always.

26:52.811 --> 26:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Jeff.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:02.521 --> 27:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
university
in Ghana aims to educate
students about corruption;

27:08.861 --> 27:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our Monday duo looks ahead to
the week in
politics; and the last show for
the famed

27:15.133 --> 27:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sometimes controversial
Ringling Brothers.

27:19.571 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: some eye-popping news
in the automotive
world.

27:23.208 --> 27:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The market value of Tesla, the
manufacturer
of high-end electric cars, has
actually surpassed

27:29.681 --> 27:36.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that of Ford and General Motors,
both of which
sell millions more cars than
Tesla does.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes a closer
look.

27:37.723 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Here are some
head-scratching
numbers to consider.

27:41.527 --> 27:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tesla's market value is $50
billion, yet Tesla
may lose nearly a billion
dollars this year,

27:48.300 --> 27:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whereas, combined, Ford and GM
are expected
to earn more than $15 billion.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last year, Tesla sold just about
80,000 vehicles.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ford and GM?

27:57.409 --> 27:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They sold nearly 17 million.

27:59.945 --> 28:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Stewart is a business
columnist for
The New York Times and a staff
writer for

28:03.315 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The New Yorker," and he's here
to help us
understand why Tesla's value is
skyrocketing.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Stewart, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

28:10.322 --> 28:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know these numbers very,
very well.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is going on here?

28:14.560 --> 28:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEWART, The New York
Times: Well, these
numbers are pretty amazing.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They make no rational sense,
really.

28:20.532 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Tesla is what I call the
sort of ultimate
story stock, which means
investors care about

28:27.239 --> 28:28.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the story.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't care about the
numbers.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not care that it's
losing.

28:31.176 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have lost over $500 million
last year,
may lose a billion this year.

28:34.479 --> 28:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they don't really care that
GM and Ford
are making billions of dollars
in profit.

28:38.951 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story with Tesla is that
they are going
to dominate the auto market,
that they are

28:43.155 --> 28:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to create the world's
safest car, that
they are going to take over the
battery market,

28:50.762 --> 28:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that they are going to
dominate and reinvent
the electric grid.

28:54.833 --> 28:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are all huge
markets, and they
think Tesla is going to dominate
every one

28:59.137 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of them.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you wrote
in a recent
column in The New York Times,
there have been

29:03.275 --> 29:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of story stock and story
companies that
the story turned out to be a lot
more fiction

29:08.647 --> 29:09.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than fact.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we know whether Tesla is
going to be
one of those?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES STEWART: Well, we don't.

29:14.219 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most story stocks which
trade at these
astronomical levels end up very
badly.

29:20.192 --> 29:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were scores of these in
the dot-com
boom now forgotten, worthless.

29:24.963 --> 29:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, more recently, the Amazon
story has caused
investors to be very excited.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amazon didn't make any money for
years.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It plowed all its revenues back
into R&amp;D.

29:36.475 --> 29:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the story is, it was going
to dominate
the vast global retail market.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It still hasn't achieved that.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It still is not making huge
amounts of money.

29:44.716 --> 29:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But investors in Amazon have
done very, very
well over a period that's now
going on to

29:49.921 --> 29:51.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, stock investors in Tesla can
do well as
long as the story holds.

29:54.359 --> 29:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, every time you see a bit of
data that
confirms the story, the stock
surges.

29:58.597 --> 30:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, it had modestly better
sales in the
last quarter than expected.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The stock was up 7 percent.

30:03.835 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I will say for Tesla, it
also has delivered
a product that people love.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's quality.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It looks great.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It performs great.

30:13.779 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far, it has actually met
its promises,
even though they seemed
farfetched at one

30:18.984 --> 30:20.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, I
would agree with
you, all those
characterizations.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a beautiful car.

30:22.988 --> 30:23.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have ridden in one.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a fantastic vehicle to be
in.

30:26.725 --> 30:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there have been some quality
and reliability
issues.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And primarily their customers
have been luxury
market customers.

30:32.597 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know Tesla is now trying to
roll out a more
mid-market car.

30:37.803 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they have those same
reliability problems,
do you worry that that could
really dent their

30:42.240 --> 30:44.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
image?

30:44.176 --> 30:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES STEWART: Well, I have to
say, in Tesla's
defense, that, yes, there have
been some issues,

30:48.180 --> 30:50.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but nothing out of the ordinary.

30:50.115 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I think, just in
January, the federal
monitors gave it its highest
safest evaluation.

30:56.121 --> 31:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the stories that
people are so
excited about is that its
autonomous driving

31:00.559 --> 31:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology is going to make the
car incredibly
safe.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we will see.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the high-end customer so
far that is
driving the sales.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a big, big step for them is
when they
try to expand that market by
moving into more

31:13.004 --> 31:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the mass market car with this
3 model at
a much higher production level.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can they keep the quality levels
up?

31:20.145 --> 31:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can they keep the consumer
satisfaction levels
up?

31:23.148 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, though, I have to say,
Tesla was very
smart.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They start at the high end.

31:27.252 --> 31:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They develop incredible brand
allure, and
now they're moving down market.

31:32.224 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GM, I think, had a terrific car
first with
the Volt, now the Bolt, but they
buried in

31:37.262 --> 31:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Chevy name plate, and it
didn't take on
any allure whatsoever for
consumers.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What are the
other automakers
saying about this?

31:43.935 --> 31:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This must make them livid.

31:45.804 --> 31:49.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES STEWART: Well, they won't
say it publicly
about a competitor, but they're
tearing their

31:49.674 --> 31:51.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hair out.

31:51.676 --> 31:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't get it at all,
because Tesla gets
the benefit of every possible
doubt from investors.

31:56.815 --> 32:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get the benefit of none.

32:00.185 --> 32:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tesla doesn't have profits, so
you can't measure
its stock compared to profits.

32:03.722 --> 32:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But profit-to-earning ratio,
which is a common
stock measure, Ford and GM have
some of the

32:08.693 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lowest in the stock market.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Tesla trades at like seven
times the revenue,
Ford, when I looked this week,
was trading

32:15.600 --> 32:18.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at 0.3 times revenue.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I do feel kind of bad
for them.

32:20.672 --> 32:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People feel the sun has set on
the traditional
auto industry, and they just are
not getting

32:25.343 --> 32:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any benefit of the doubt.

32:27.245 --> 32:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
James B. Stewart,
thank you very much.

32:31.883 --> 32:38.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEWART: Sure.

32:39.024 --> 32:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The continent of
Africa does
not now hold many
internationally well-known

32:48.667 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
universities, but one man is
trying to change
that, a one-time Microsoft
executive who was

32:54.239 --> 32:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
educated in the United States,
Patrick Awuah.

32:56.975 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro
reports, as part of his Agents
for Change

33:02.447 --> 33:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series, one special focus of
classes is to
teach Africa's next generation
of leaders

33:08.253 --> 33:10.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about ethics.

33:10.055 --> 33:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It looks
like a pretty
typical college campus, with
students working

33:15.193 --> 33:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in computer labs, studying at
the library,
or hanging out with friends.

33:19.564 --> 33:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Ashesi University, in the
West African
nation of Ghana, has embarked on
an experiment

33:25.370 --> 33:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which its founder hopes will
help start to
fundamentally change the entire
continent.

33:30.275 --> 33:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH, President, Ashesi
University:
In the next three decades or so,
the population

33:35.914 --> 33:41.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Africa is going to double,
and something
like 40 percent of working-age
people are

33:41.987 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be Africans in the
world.

33:43.989 --> 33:47.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of jobs need to be
created.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we need to be educating
the next bench
in a way that they're going to
go create those

33:51.029 --> 33:53.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs and create those
opportunities for people.

33:53.198 --> 33:57.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Patrick
Awuah was born
and raised in Ghana, but came to
the United

33:57.402 --> 34:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States on scholarship to get an
undergraduate
degree in engineering from
Swarthmore and

34:02.974 --> 34:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an MBA from the University of
California,
Berkeley.

34:06.344 --> 34:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went on to become a program
manager at
Microsoft.

34:12.183 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he decided to return to his
homeland,
he assumed he would start a
software company,

34:17.088 --> 34:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but quickly realized the system
of higher
education was so poor, there
wasn't a competent

34:22.160 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work force to hire.

34:24.429 --> 34:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Experts say the problem with
education in
Africa is not so much that there
aren't enough

34:28.867 --> 34:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
institutions, but, rather, it's
in what students
are taught and how they're
taught it, with

34:33.972 --> 34:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an emphasis much more on rote
learning and
memorization, much less on
critical thinking,

34:38.810 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on thinking for oneself.

34:40.812 --> 34:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: Under colonial
rule, the educational
system was really designed for
that, to educate

34:47.185 --> 34:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to follow instructions
and to do things
in a very consistent way.

34:51.222 --> 34:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, Awuah
decided he had
to start his own university.

34:55.460 --> 35:01.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With money from American
friends, colleagues
and foundations, he raised $2.5
million to

35:01.232 --> 35:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open a school with an initial
class of 30
freshman in 2002.

35:07.005 --> 35:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ashesi has now grown to a campus
of nearly
800 students.

35:10.909 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guiding principle throughout
has been
a laser-like focus on three
principles: ethical

35:17.015 --> 35:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leadership, innovation and
entrepreneurship.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: We need a lot of
innovation.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need people who are trained
to drive that.

35:25.090 --> 35:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need people who are going
to be working
on the government side, who are
going to create

35:30.261 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an enabling environment for
that.

35:32.197 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ghana, like
most countries
in Africa, has been plagued by
government-related

35:36.935 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corruption, which has hampered
job growth.

35:39.004 --> 35:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD, Professor, Ashesi
University: For
the next three to four minutes,
come up with

35:44.876 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a list of things that a brick
can be used
for.

35:47.912 --> 35:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ashesi's
goal is to teach
students to fight against the
temptations

35:52.117 --> 35:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of corruption and think outside
the box.

35:55.086 --> 36:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It begins almost from the moment
a freshman
arrives on campus and takes a
mandatory course

36:00.358 --> 36:03.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called Foundations of Design and
Entrepreneurship.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: How many do you have?

36:05.263 --> 36:06.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Twenty-nine.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROSE DODD: Twenty-nine.

36:07.532 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:09.367 --> 36:15.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: The instructor
says, you go
find a problem that you think is
worth solving,

36:16.007 --> 36:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then come up with an answer
to problem.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very open-ended and then...

36:21.346 --> 36:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And scary in
part, I imagine.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PATRICK AWUAH: Scary.

36:25.617 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels like you have been
thrown into this
kind of weird world, where you
can't plant

36:32.791 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your feet on the ground.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very different way of
approaching education.

36:37.395 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: When you see a
problem, your first
human instinct is to think of
the first, easiest

36:44.769 --> 36:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
solution that comes to mind.

36:46.571 --> 36:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Professor
Rose Dodd, an
Ashesi alumna herself, says she
hopes the

36:50.742 --> 36:55.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
class will encourage her
students to take
on the entrenched establishments
in Ghana.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: Don't be limited.

36:57.115 --> 37:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't feel that whatever the
system is limits
you.

37:01.719 --> 37:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about whatever else could
be and then
try it out.

37:06.057 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the goal, the end
goal should
be to make life better for
everybody around

37:13.698 --> 37:14.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

37:14.699 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Look at the question on the
board.

37:16.568 --> 37:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Indeed, many
Ashesi graduates
have gone on to do some form of
public service,

37:21.206 --> 37:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's teaching in rural
elementary
or secondary schools, or
mentoring the next

37:26.144 --> 37:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generation of young women.

37:30.548 --> 37:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yawa Hansen-Quao became the
first female student
council president at Ashesi in
2006.

37:39.524 --> 37:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While in college, she began
thinking about
a way to help women grow into
leadership positions,

37:44.362 --> 37:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a goal that she made a reality
with the founding
of Leading Ladies' Network.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAWA HANSEN-QUAO, Leading
Ladies' Network:
Our goal as an organization is
to help women

37:52.904 --> 37:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get out of themselves and their
problems and
to start thinking of what kind
of change they

37:57.375 --> 37:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can bring to the community
around them.

37:59.244 --> 38:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One young
woman that Quao
has mentored is Narkie Agbettor,
another Ashesi

38:04.516 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grad.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has just started her own
small business,
selling virgin coconut oil
products.

38:09.954 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while she's enthusiastic
about her company,
she admits it's not always easy
dealing with

38:14.626 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government bureaucracy and
seeing competitors
resort to bribery.

38:18.363 --> 38:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARKIE AGBETTOR, Business Owner:
There are
solutions to every problem out
there.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It requires thinking.

38:24.736 --> 38:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you want to be successful
and you want
to be ethical as well.

38:31.042 --> 38:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Patrick
Awuah knows that
his young, idealistic graduates,
many who

38:36.414 --> 38:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from families of modest
means, will be
severely tested out in the real
world.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he hopes the lessons they
have learned
at Ashesi will help guide them.

38:45.490 --> 38:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: Are some alumni
probably not
holding the line?

38:49.360 --> 38:51.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Probably.

38:51.162 --> 38:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would hope that even those
who are not
holding the line are thinking
twice about

38:58.236 --> 39:00.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing it.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The other
cultural problem
that Awuah hopes to change is
stopping the

39:03.441 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so-called brain drain, where,
after college,
people leave the continent to
seek careers

39:08.880 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in developed countries.

39:10.848 --> 39:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, 90 percent of Ashesi
grads have stayed
and work in Africa.

39:16.521 --> 39:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Fred
de Sam Lazaro
in Accra, Ghana.

39:21.359 --> 39:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

39:26.664 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

39:36.708 --> 39:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

39:42.180 --> 39:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Monday, in other words,
time for Politics
Monday with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

39:47.218 --> 39:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR,
who joins
us today from California.

39:52.957 --> 39:53.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tam, I just said California.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to tell us where in
California.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:58.396 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Southern
California.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That narrows it down a lot.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:02.133 --> 40:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: A little bit.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All right, the L.A. area.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let's start by talking
about a very
serious subject, and that is the
decision

40:09.407 --> 40:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the United States to strike
the airfield
in Syria last week.

40:15.647 --> 40:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Amy, we're still dealing
with the strategic,
the military repercussions from
this, but

40:20.785 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what about the political?

40:21.953 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is the public reacting?

40:24.322 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I want to ask you both
about Congress.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

40:27.058 --> 40:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congress seems to be giving
somewhat a
mixed message on how they feel
about what

40:32.430 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened in Syria over the
weekend.

40:34.299 --> 40:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been at three polls
that have come
out since the strikes happened.

40:38.636 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A majority of Americans say they
approve of
this decision, anywhere from 51
to 57 percent.

40:44.375 --> 40:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, when you ask them the
next question,
which is, should we do more
things like this,

40:48.546 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the majority of Americans say,
we don't want
to see any more airstrikes.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when you ask the
question -- and
I think this is also really
important -- about

40:56.020 --> 41:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the impact has been on the
president,
did Americans rally around the
president,

41:00.391 --> 41:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did this bump up his approval
rating, it really
hasn't done much at all.

41:04.662 --> 41:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His approval rating still stands
somewhere
around 40 percent.

41:08.032 --> 41:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have a public that is
basically, there
are a small majority agreeing
with the strike,

41:15.206 --> 41:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they don't want to see much
more.

41:17.442 --> 41:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it hasn't really benefited
the president,
nor has it made people less
likely to support

41:22.980 --> 41:24.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's still basically at the same
place he's
always been, which again comes
back to something

41:26.884 --> 41:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we talk about almost every week,
is our deep
polarization in this country.

41:31.222 --> 41:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so much of
this, Tam, I
think, is people -- a matter of
people comparing

41:35.226 --> 41:40.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how this president is handling
Syria and the
Middle East, that part of the
world, vs. the

41:40.164 --> 41:41.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way President Obama handled it.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's right.

41:43.468 --> 41:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in terms of Congress, when
President
Obama went to Congress in 2013
and asked for

41:50.041 --> 41:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorization to take similar
action back
in 2013, Congress was kind of,
like, wait,

41:55.913 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a hot potato, we don't
necessarily
want this hot potato.

41:58.816 --> 42:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found an out that sort of
let them off
the hook with this deal with
Russia to dispose

42:05.323 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the chemical weapons, which,
clearly, in
retrospect, they're not all gone
somehow.

42:11.629 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Congress has frequently
wanted to have
some ability to weigh in, but
then when it

42:18.636 --> 42:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes time to actually weigh in
to authorize
the use of military force in a
formal way,

42:24.575 --> 42:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have had a lot of trouble
agreeing on
something.

42:28.012 --> 42:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, as Tam
just said,
this is exactly what President
Obama...

42:32.984 --> 42:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're talking
three years later.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Different.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's what he
was concerned
about, too, and led to the
decision not to.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It feels very
familiar.

42:41.459 --> 42:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot that too is the fact
that Americans
feel very similar to the
situation in Syria

42:47.265 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today as they did back in 2013.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a ABC poll.

42:50.401 --> 42:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fifty-four percent said they
oppose using
additional airstrikes.

42:54.605 --> 42:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look back at where we
were in the
fall of 2013, when then
President Obama was

42:59.110 --> 43:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about airstrikes, about
60 percent
opposed doing that.

43:02.547 --> 43:08.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the public isn't any more --
looking forward
anymore today than they were
back then to

43:08.286 --> 43:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting more deeply involved in
that part
of the world.

43:10.655 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, speaking
of Congress,
members going home, went home
this weekend

43:15.092 --> 43:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for two-week Easter recess.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they likely to hear much
from the public
about Syria?

43:20.031 --> 43:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are people still talking about
health care?

43:21.966 --> 43:24.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are we expecting in that
regard?

43:24.569 --> 43:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think that
health care is
something they're far more
likely to hear

43:29.507 --> 43:30.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

43:30.908 --> 43:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Town halls, if they're happening
-- and fewer
of them are happening.

43:34.345 --> 43:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are more tele-town halls,
and Facebook
town halls, and any sort of town
hall that

43:39.150 --> 43:44.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't allow the same sort of
video images
that dominated during the rise
of the Tea

43:44.989 --> 43:46.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

43:46.224 --> 43:48.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Absolutely, they are going to
hear about health
care.

43:48.593 --> 43:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's an interesting time for
the health
care legislation.

43:53.130 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans in Congress,
realizing they're
about to go home, and not
wanting to say,

43:57.668 --> 44:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wow, we have completely failed
to repeal and
replace the Affordable Care Act,
did some

44:01.772 --> 44:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amendments at the very end,
right before they
left for recess, so that
Republican members

44:06.944 --> 44:10.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Congress could go to
Republican districts
and say, well, we're still
working on it,

44:10.982 --> 44:13.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care is not dead.

44:13.084 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrats are trying
to put a lot
of pressure.

44:16.787 --> 44:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the left side, progressives
are really
pushing members of Congress and
trying to

44:22.527 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make sure that this effort
doesn't come back
to life.

44:25.696 --> 44:29.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
about that,
Amy, but I also want to get to
another way

44:29.934 --> 44:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of gauging public reaction to
what's going
on in Washington, and that is
these special

44:35.039 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
congressional elections that are
taking place
in the next couple of weeks.

44:38.109 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very interesting, Republicans
worried about
some of these special
congressional...

44:41.979 --> 44:43.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: They are.

44:43.848 --> 44:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have one coming up tomorrow
in Kansas and
then the next week in Georgia in
two districts

44:47.418 --> 44:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are heavily Republican.

44:49.253 --> 44:53.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These districts are special
elections because
their Republican members are now
sitting in

44:53.491 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Cabinet.

44:55.560 --> 45:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this goes to the issue
really of enthusiasm,
and the enthusiasm gap between
Democrats and

45:01.632 --> 45:02.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

45:02.733 --> 45:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what Republicans are
very fearful
about.

45:04.502 --> 45:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not seeing that energy
around their
candidates in the same way that
Democrats

45:09.941 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

45:11.876 --> 45:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that energy equals
turnout, especially
when you have a special
election, where not

45:14.879 --> 45:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a whole lot of people are coming
out and voting.

45:17.315 --> 45:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're going to be looking at
these special
elections, first of all, to see
if there's

45:21.352 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an upset.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This would be a very big deal,
especially
in Kansas.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a district...

45:25.456 --> 45:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are red,
very red places.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: These are red, red
districts.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This district in Kansas went for
Trump by
almost 30 points.

45:32.029 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, in fact, now is
making recorded
calls, sending those in right
now.

45:36.934 --> 45:42.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz, is
out there,
again, trying to get people
excited, energized.

45:42.106 --> 45:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's Democrats who are
energized.

45:44.175 --> 45:50.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The anti-Trump momentum, you can
feel both
in the -- how voters are
reacting in these

45:50.715 --> 45:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of places, as well as the
fund-raising.

45:53.684 --> 45:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrat in Georgia -- this,
again, a
very Republican district outside
of Atlanta,

45:57.888 --> 46:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a district that Tom Price, the
now HHS secretary,
won easily, very, very close
there -- he's

46:04.095 --> 46:07.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raised over $8 million as an
unknown candidate.

46:07.865 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not a celebrity.

46:09.567 --> 46:13.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that shows the fervor and
energy out there
on the side of Democrats.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it, Tam, kind
of the Tea
Party with the shoe on the other
foot now?

46:16.874 --> 46:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It is certainly
sort of a 180-degree
turnaround.

46:21.512 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, next weekend,
there is going
to be a Tax Day protest.

46:25.483 --> 46:31.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is exactly eight years
after the last
Tax Day protest that was really
the kickoff

46:31.088 --> 46:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Tea Party movement.

46:32.690 --> 46:37.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, these special
elections are
special for a reason.

46:37.228 --> 46:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can be sort of -- they
aren't necessarily
good indicators of what's to
some.

46:42.066 --> 46:49.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats won a special election
in April
of 2010, and then that fall were
completely

46:49.473 --> 46:51.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knocked out, lost something like
63 seats.

46:51.575 --> 46:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The important thing
about the
special elections -- Tam's point
is correct,

46:56.080 --> 46:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you don't want to read too much
into them.

46:57.381 --> 46:59.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

46:59.183 --> 47:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But a success for
the Democrats
would be that they do very well,
i.e., they

47:03.020 --> 47:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win, or come close enough that
it impacts
their ability to recruit
candidates to run

47:08.392 --> 47:10.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2018.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People get excited when they see
that you're
getting really close to
Republican seats.

47:12.930 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it helps with fund-raising.

47:14.465 --> 47:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we never
get tired of
talking about elections here.

47:16.767 --> 47:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's only been five months since
that big
one, when the earth shook.

47:20.371 --> 47:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And then we get
midterms, Judy.

47:22.039 --> 47:24.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when we get
the midterms
coming up.

47:24.375 --> 47:28.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith,
Politics Monday,
thank you both.

47:28.379 --> 47:34.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

47:35.019 --> 47:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

47:41.625 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For many years,
146, to be
exact, Ringling Bros. and Barnum
&amp; Bailey

47:48.499 --> 47:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Circus has been awing crowds
with acrobatic
feats and animal stunts.

47:53.504 --> 47:57.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Greatest Show on Earth
is coming to
an end next month.

47:57.274 --> 48:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its parent company made the
decision after
ticket sales had been dropping
for years.

48:02.146 --> 48:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The circus also struggled with a
long court
battle over the treatment of
animals, particularly

48:07.184 --> 48:08.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the elephants.

48:08.652 --> 48:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The circus won in court, but the
elephants
were dropped from the show.

48:13.124 --> 48:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up as Ringling Bros.
rolled through
Washington, D.C., one more time,
and spoke

48:18.562 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with longtime performers and
their families.

JOHNATHAN LEE IVERSON, Ringling
Bros.: My
name is Johnathan Lee Iverson,
ringmaster

48:34.879 --> 48:37.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey.

48:37.448 --> 48:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just pure, unadulterated,
unapologetic
entertainment.

48:41.786 --> 48:50.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where everything you look at now
is sort of
defiled, circus is the last bit
of magic in

48:50.394 --> 48:53.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, and your children's
imaginations
are safe there.

48:53.964 --> 48:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Your imagination is safe here.

48:56.233 --> 49:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TATIANA TCHALABAEV, Ringling
Bros.: Well,
in this amazing show, I'm
playing the character

49:02.640 --> 49:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Queen Tatiana of the
Circus of Fire.

49:05.142 --> 49:06.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are artists.

49:06.310 --> 49:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are performers, like the
people in the
movies.

49:09.413 --> 49:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're coming out there and
they are doing
the shot.

49:14.218 --> 49:16.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are doing live.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have no repeats.

49:17.822 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We basically have to perform our
stunts.

49:19.924 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNATHAN LEE IVERSON: It's all
about the
impossible.

49:24.195 --> 49:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's all about really art at its
highest level.

49:27.531 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are flying.

49:29.099 --> 49:31.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're talking to animals.

49:31.669 --> 49:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRELL WALKER, Father: Kids
love the clowns,
the animals, the cotton candy,
the popcorn,

49:37.241 --> 49:38.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all that stuff.

49:38.342 --> 49:39.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we have a great time.

49:39.844 --> 49:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHY ALMASSY, Circus Goer:
We're extremely
disappointed to see it end.

49:41.245 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand the concerns, but
we're very,
very sad.

49:42.246 --> 49:44.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sad to see it end.

49:44.114 --> 49:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM, Circus Goer: I'm not
very happy about
it, because I love coming here,
and it's really

49:45.349 --> 49:46.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nice and fun for me and my
family to hang
out together.

49:46.517 --> 49:56.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DERRELL WALKER: I like the lions
and the tigers.

49:56.961 --> 49:59.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I like the suspense.

49:59.463 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I like the danger that's
involved.

50:02.733 --> 50:07.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's just -- and they're
beautiful
animals.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're very beautiful animals,
very, very
majestic.

50:10.774 --> 50:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNALISE, Circus Goer: I like
the animals,
like how they're colorful.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN PAYNE, Vice President,
Ringling Bros.:
Have the animal rights disputes
hurt Ringling

50:18.482 --> 50:19.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bros.?

50:19.483 --> 50:20.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, it was a factor.

50:20.484 --> 50:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it wasn't the only factor.

50:21.886 --> 50:26.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won in court, and we won in
most legislative
fights that we have.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Stephen Payne.

50:28.225 --> 50:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm the vice president of
corporate communications
for Feld Entertainment.

50:30.594 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we transitioned the
elephants off of
the circus last year, we knew we
were going

50:35.499 --> 50:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see some decline in ticket
sales.

50:37.167 --> 50:39.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The entertainment landscape has
changed.

50:39.536 --> 50:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Ringling Bros. started,
there wasn't
TV.

50:42.673 --> 50:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now there's 1,000 stations.

50:44.608 --> 50:46.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There wasn't iPhones.

50:46.443 --> 50:51.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a huge, huge undertaking
that requires
an immense number of talented
crew members

50:51.448 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pull off.

50:53.150 --> 50:54.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER LACEY, Ringling Bros.:
You have
to be completely dedicated to
the animals.

50:54.852 --> 50:56.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to love doing what
you're doing.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's what keeps you safe.

50:57.421 --> 51:00.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been doing it now for
22 years
solid.

51:00.658 --> 51:05.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Alexander Lacey, the
big cat trainer
and presenter here on the
Ringling Bros. and

51:05.596 --> 51:07.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Barnum &amp; Bailey.

51:07.498 --> 51:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, everybody wants to
see the lion-tiger
trainer get eaten, so I have a
point in my

51:11.302 --> 51:15.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
act where the lions attack on
command, which
is quite a highlight, because
people think

51:15.973 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have suddenly gone out of
control.

51:17.107 --> 51:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's a trained movement.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVIS VASSALLO, Ringling Bros.:
When you go
to a show, you don't think about
your problem

51:22.012 --> 51:23.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at home.

51:23.747 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You just enjoy the show you, and
you have
a nice time, and you feel like
children again.

51:27.151 --> 51:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Davis Vassallo.

51:30.554 --> 51:37.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am the highlight clown of
Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &amp; Bailey.

51:37.061 --> 51:40.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My grandfather was a clown.

51:40.531 --> 51:41.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My father was a clown.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just have fun.

51:43.300 --> 51:45.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I become like children.

51:45.269 --> 51:50.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, for the
people, watching
a clown is a little bit like
watching children.

51:50.274 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can you not smile when you
see children,
a little bit goofy, falling
down, do some

51:56.213 --> 51:57.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
funny things?

51:57.481 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in this moment, you don't
think about
anything else.

51:59.750 --> 52:04.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TATIANA TCHALABAEV: For us it's
our home.

52:04.188 --> 52:06.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's our life.

52:06.056 --> 52:07.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's our love.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's our heart.

52:09.793 --> 52:11.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's everything.

52:11.562 --> 52:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When, in the end, our announcer
is saying
it for the last time, enjoy
Ringling Bros.

52:17.234 --> 52:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, my
tears are coming
out.

52:21.338 --> 52:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNATHAN LEE IVERSON: When
those curtains
close, it -- you know, a part of
a part of

52:27.044 --> 52:33.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us ends in America.

52:33.884 --> 52:48.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Starting tonight
on PBS, "American
Experience" presents a
three-night series

52:48.332 --> 52:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the war that at the time
was thought
to be the war to end all wars.

52:53.537 --> 52:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Great War" explores the
reluctance of
President Woodrow Wilson to lead
the United

52:58.375 --> 53:04.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States into the deadly conflict,
the experiences
of African-American and Latino
soldiers as

53:04.348 --> 53:06.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they fought for their country
and their rights.

53:06.984 --> 53:12.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it probes one of the most
oppressive domestic
crackdowns, as suspected German
supporters

53:12.322 --> 53:13.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were rounded up.

53:13.891 --> 53:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"The Great War" airs starting
tonight through
Wednesday on most PBS stations.

53:19.463 --> 53:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

today, including novelist Colson
Whitehead

53:28.739 --> 53:30.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

administration's war on drugs.

53:47.091 --> 53:48.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.
