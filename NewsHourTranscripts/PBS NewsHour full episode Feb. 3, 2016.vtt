GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Candidates
try to win over New Hampshire,
as Hillary

00:11.945 --> 00:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and Bernie Sanders
prepare for a town
hall forum tonight.

00:16.216 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
A rare case of the Zika virus,
possibly being

00:21.655 --> 00:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexually transmitted in Texas,
raises new
questions and concerns.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And a violent
response to refugees
in Sweden, as the right wing
rallies against

00:32.866 --> 00:34.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an influx of thousands.

00:34.668 --> 00:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK HAGBERG, Nordic Youth:
It's chaos
in Sweden. It's getting worse by
the minute.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like the gates of hell is
open.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.379 --> 00:49.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:49.583 --> 01:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
political
wars are escalating, as the New
Hampshire

01:01.929 --> 01:08.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
primary draws another day
closer. Democrats
traded charges today over who's
more progressive,

01:09.002 --> 01:14.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and two Republicans quit the
field, as their
rivals wrangled over the outcome
in Iowa.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It's, honestly, really, really
dishonest.

01:18.078 --> 01:23.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump was
one of two
Republicans who kept their fire
trained on

01:23.250 --> 01:29.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz for something that
happened on caucus
night. In a string of tweets
today, Trump

01:29.890 --> 01:34.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said: "Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa.
He stole
it."

01:34.261 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He charged Cruz supporters with
spreading
rumors as the caucuses got under
way that

01:39.433 --> 01:45.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another rival, Ben Carson, was
dropping out.
Trump called it fraud and
insisted -- quote

01:45.505 --> 01:50.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "Either a new election should
take place,
or the Cruz results nullified."

01:50.277 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Cruz spokesman denied the
campaign officially
sanctioned the rumors, but said
the Texas

01:56.516 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senator has apologized to
Carson.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He spoke himself today in
Washington.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Senator
Cruz told me that he wasn't
aware of that

02:05.359 --> 02:12.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I talked to him, and that
he didn't agree
with that kind of thing. And we
will wait

02:12.366 --> 02:15.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and see what he does to
demonstrate that.

02:15.669 --> 02:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The results from
Iowa also
sealed the fate of two more
Republicans.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate:
Today, I will suspend my
campaign for the

02:23.744 --> 02:25.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rand Paul, who
finished fifth,
said he's dropping out.

02:28.515 --> 02:33.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: I'm proud of our
principled
campaign, and the thousands of
young people

02:33.120 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been energized by our
message of
limited constitutional
government.

02:37.391 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Rick
Santorum, who finished
11th, is following him out the
door. Meanwhile,

02:44.231 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio, a surprisingly
strong third in
Iowa, focused on Democrats.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
We cannot afford to wake up in
November to

02:51.471 --> 02:55.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the news that we have a
president named Bernie
Sanders or a president named
Hillary Clinton.

02:55.642 --> 03:00.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Rubio also
faced criticism
again from Chris Christie, who
charged the

03:00.981 --> 03:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Florida senator won't give
straight answers
to New Hampshire voters.

03:06.386 --> 03:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the Democratic side, the talk
was all about
liberal credentials.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It began with this yesterday
from Bernie Sanders:

03:13.393 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you think Hillary
Clinton is
a progressive?

03:15.829 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Some days, yes, except when she
announces

03:19.666 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she is a proud moderate,
and then I guess
she's not a progressive.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton shot back
today at
a rally in Derry, New Hampshire.

03:27.808 --> 03:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I think it was a good day for
progressives

03:32.612 --> 03:36.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I helped to get eight
million kids health
care under the Children's Health
Insurance

03:36.783 --> 03:37.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Program.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:39.219 --> 03:44.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And I
think it was
a good day for progressives when
I joined

03:44.558 --> 03:49.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with colleagues in the Senate to
stop George
W. Bush from privatizing Social
Security.

03:49.696 --> 03:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton and
Sanders will appear
separately tonight at a CNN town
hall.

03:54.901 --> 04:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news, oil prices
reversed course again and jumped
8 percent,

04:01.374 --> 04:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and stocks mostly followed suit.
The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 183
points to close

04:07.614 --> 04:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 16336. The Nasdaq lost 12
points and the
S&amp;P 500 added nine.

04:13.620 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Syrian peace
talks in Geneva
came to a halt today, just two
days after

04:19.092 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being convened. The opposition
had demanded
humanitarian moves take place
first, while

04:25.031 --> 04:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Assad regime focused on the
makeup of
the opposition side. Given the
impasse, the

04:30.637 --> 04:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special U.N. envoy said it's
time to take
a break and resume February 25.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: I have
therefore taken this

04:38.678 --> 04:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision to bring a temporary
pause, temporary
pause. This is not the end, and
it is not

04:45.886 --> 04:53.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the failure of the talks. Why?
They came and
they stayed, not only, but both
sides insisted

04:53.560 --> 04:58.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on the fact that they are
interested in having
the political process started.

04:58.465 --> 05:03.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
came as Syrian
government ground forces, backed
by Russian

05:03.503 --> 05:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes, broke a long-running
siege by
the opposition of two villages
near Aleppo,

05:09.976 --> 05:11.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syria's largest city.

05:11.912 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The near-daily
Palestinian attacks
on Israelis escalated today.
Police say three

05:16.850 --> 05:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palestinians armed with guns,
knives and bombs
killed one border security
officer and wounded

05:22.455 --> 05:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another in Jerusalem. Police
then shot and
killed the attackers.
Authorities say the

05:28.161 --> 05:31.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians were planning a
larger-scale
assault on civilians.

05:31.765 --> 05:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
Taliban gunmen
have killed a 10-year-old boy
who had fought

05:37.637 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the militants. Wasil Ahmad
became a local
hero last year for joining a
militia when

05:43.343 --> 05:49.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his father was killed. Police
say he was shot
twice in the head Monday in
Uruzgan province

05:49.783 --> 05:52.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as he left home near the
provincial capital.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: North Korea's
neighbors warned
the communist state today to
abandon plans

05:57.090 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for launching a satellite this
month. South
Korea said the North will pay --
quote -- "a

06:01.895 --> 06:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severe price" if it goes ahead.

06:04.497 --> 06:10.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Japan's military deployed
missile interceptors
in Tokyo, as Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe urged

06:10.704 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
North Korea to show restraint.

06:12.539 --> 06:17.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, President
Obama paid his first visit to an
American

06:17.577 --> 06:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosque. He spoke at the Islamic
Society of
Baltimore and argued that the
U.S. has no

06:23.383 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place for bigotry, and that
Muslims are too
often blamed -- quote -- "for
the violent

06:28.488 --> 06:30.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acts of the very few."

06:30.390 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
When any religious group is
targeted, we all

06:33.627 --> 06:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a responsibility to speak
up, and we
have to reject a politics that
seeks to manipulate

06:43.403 --> 06:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prejudice or bias and targets
people because
of religion.

06:47.507 --> 06:53.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
visit followed
Islamist attacks in Paris and
San Bernardino,

06:53.847 --> 06:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California, and a growing number
of criticisms
of American Muslims.

06:57.617 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there's word
that two more
NFL football stars, both
quarterbacks, had

07:03.623 --> 07:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the brain disease CTE. Ken
Stabler and the
Oakland Raiders won the Super
Bowl in 1977.

07:10.163 --> 07:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He died last year. And Boston
University researchers
now say he had widespread brain
damage. And

07:16.503 --> 07:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earl Morrall's family says he,
too, had advanced
CTE at his death in 2014. He won
a Super Bowl

07:23.743 --> 07:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Baltimore Colts in
1971.

07:25.712 --> 07:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
addressing the root cause of the
Zika virus

07:31.051 --> 07:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outbreak; the rise of Sweden's
radical right,
a backlash against refugees; a
struggling

07:38.024 --> 07:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yahoo slashes jobs; and much
more.

07:43.830 --> 07:57.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Anxiety over the
Zika virus continues
to build. In Florida, where
there are at least

07:57.477 --> 08:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nine cases of the illness,
Governor Rick Scott
declared a health emergency in
four counties

08:03.049 --> 08:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, including Miami-Dade.
Zika has been
found in more than 25 countries
in the Americas

08:08.955 --> 08:10.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Caribbean.

08:10.824 --> 08:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly all cases come from
mosquitoes. And
the CDC issued a new travel
advisory today

08:16.329 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Jamaica. At the same time,
public health
officials say they want to learn
more about

08:20.900 --> 08:25.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a reported case of sexual
transmission of
Zika in Texas.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at some of the central
questions with
Dr. Michael Osterholm, director
of the Center

08:29.476 --> 08:34.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Infectious Disease Research
and Policy
at the University of Minnesota.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for joining us.

08:36.783 --> 08:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How worried should we be with
these new reports
every day, these new
classifications every

08:41.654 --> 08:43.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
day of this new virus?

08:43.490 --> 08:46.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, Director,
University
of Minnesota Center for
Infectious Disease

08:46.326 --> 08:50.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Research: Well, first of all,
the fact that
there's been a case now
documented of sexual

08:50.697 --> 08:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transmissions doesn't surprise
us. That's
already happened before.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, how often it
will occur?
And at this point, we don't have
any evidence

08:57.437 --> 09:02.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a frequent occurrence, but
clearly for
those who travel from the United
States to

09:02.342 --> 09:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of these affected countries
and a male
coming back having sex with his
female partner

09:07.247 --> 09:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who either may be pregnant or
could become
pregnant is a concern. And in
that sense,

09:11.084 --> 09:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's what we need to be most
worried about.

09:12.819 --> 09:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How significant is a
WHO call
or declaration of emergency in
this case?

09:19.592 --> 09:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well,
first of all,
to really understand this
concept of emergency,

09:24.197 --> 09:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it really does is, it just
helps prioritize
the kind of resources and the
importance to

09:29.469 --> 09:31.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world that this is.

09:31.271 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shouldn't mean that people
should panic
or that people should somehow do
something

09:35.508 --> 09:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very, very different. What we
need to do -- and
we know how to do it, actually
-- is what

09:39.446 --> 09:43.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do, what we call source
reduction for the
mosquitoes in the Americas,
meaning let's

09:43.750 --> 09:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get rid of the breeding sites.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This particular mosquito is
really what I
call the Norway rat of
mosquitoes. It lives

09:49.055 --> 09:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with humans. It loves to life in
the human
home. It breeds in water bodies
that occur,

09:54.394 --> 10:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, in a pop cap or a
piece of discarded
tinfoil, non-biodegradable
material, tires.

10:01.468 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we clean up the solid waste,
the garbage,
really, around our communities
in those counties

10:06.940 --> 10:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and countries where this is
occurring, we
can have a great impact on the
transmission

10:11.711 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this virus by this mosquito.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, focusing on the
mosquitoes
is what they call vector
control. How much

10:16.983 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should attention be spent on
that and how
much on developing a vaccine?

10:20.220 --> 10:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well,
first of all,
there is no one answer. It's all
of the answers.

10:25.859 --> 10:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to do as much as can
with the source
reduction, meaning get rid of
where they breed.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This type of mosquito is very
different than,
for example, the one that causes
malaria,

10:34.901 --> 10:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in most instances, which might
be in large
bodes of water, in rice fields
and so forth.

10:39.639 --> 10:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is really breeding in very,
very small
bodies of water, as I said, such
as might

10:44.177 --> 10:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in a discarded wrapper,
inside a tire.
The second thing is, you want to
make sure

10:48.414 --> 10:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you can kill the adults who
do that,
but that by itself is not
enough. That's often

10:53.052 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great photo opportunity to
show someone
out with a spraying machine, but
that is truly

10:57.657 --> 10:59.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not it.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to do all of that, plus
you want
to work on vaccines. You want to
look at,

11:02.729 --> 11:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can you use genetically modified
mosquitoes?
So, all of these are things that
should be

11:06.533 --> 11:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought to bear. And I think the
point that
has been missed here in this
country is that

11:10.637 --> 11:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this mosquito has already been
causing very
serious death, disease and
death, in South

11:16.509 --> 11:21.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
America, Central America,
already, with dengue
and another virus called
chikungunya.

11:21.915 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so by taking care of the
Zika virus, we
actually end up taking care of
all these other

11:26.953 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ones.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So this is similar,
rather than
different, from something like
the dengue

11:30.523 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
virus, which last we were
talking about that
was in 2013, I think?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Right,
exactly.

11:36.262 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you know, on this very
program, there
has been discussion about how
many thousands

11:40.934 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people have died, how many
people had serious
illness. In a sense, if you take
care of dealing

11:47.040 --> 11:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with any one of these viruses,
you take care
of all of them.

11:51.344 --> 11:55.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so while -- what has
happened really is
because of the issue with
microcephaly, and

11:55.815 --> 12:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this very, very horrible image
of these children
with these very small heads, the
world has

12:01.788 --> 12:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now paid attention. This has now
become a
photo opportunity kind of
crisis.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, now that the
world is paying...

12:07.427 --> 12:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: And that
wasn't the
case with dengue.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now that the world is paying
attention,
what are the questions that
should be getting

12:13.199 --> 12:14.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asked which are not yet?

12:15.068 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well,
first of all,
we have to find out just how bad
this disease

12:19.472 --> 12:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really is, meaning in terms of
number of cases.

12:22.141 --> 12:27.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's no doubt that
microcephaly, or these
small heads, in newborns, as --
and small

12:27.113 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
brains, as well as the
Guillain-Barre syndrome,
this type of paralysis disease,
is occurring

12:33.252 --> 12:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of Zika. What we have to
understand
is in fact how frequently it's
occurring,

12:38.458 --> 12:40.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where it's occurring.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, much of Brazil has
not been impacted.
So, when we come up with these
country-wide

12:43.930 --> 12:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers, it doesn't mean much.
What we have
to do is look at where it's
going to unfold.

12:48.134 --> 12:53.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just as an example, the
chikungunya virus,
which came into St. Martin in
December of

12:53.172 --> 12:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2013, is still unfolding across
the Americas.
Expect the same thing with the
Zika virus.

12:58.745 --> 13:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the next two years, we are
just going
to just see this continue wave
after wave

13:02.348 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go through these communities.

13:04.250 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Dr. Michael
Osterholm of the University
of Minnesota, thank you very
much.

13:11.791 --> 13:27.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sweden is
struggling to accommodate
165,000 people who've applied
for asylum there

13:27.473 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amid the refugee crisis. Now, in
a reversal
of its open door policy, the
government says

13:32.879 --> 13:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as many as half could face
deportation.

13:36.082 --> 13:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A growing right-wing reaction to
the migrant
influx has fueled tensions.

13:41.187 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Stockholm, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

13:44.724 --> 13:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sweden fashions
itself as
the world's humanitarian
conscience and safe

13:49.629 --> 13:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harbor for more refugees per
capita than any
other European nation, but it
has been shaken

13:55.034 --> 13:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a series of incidents that
have ruptured
that image.

13:59.038 --> 14:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGNUS RANSTORP, Sweden National
Defense College:
I would say that Sweden's social
structures

14:09.248 --> 14:10.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are under severe stress.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Magnus Ranstorp
is an expert
on extremism in Scandinavia.

14:14.320 --> 14:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGNUS RANSTORP: It's a cocktail
of various
ingredients which makes society
extremely

14:19.025 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polarized. And the government is
having a
really difficult time dealing
with this.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MORAD, Refugee Advocate: As
a refugee
here, I would say it's pretty
hostile.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Tina Morad is a
Kurdish political
scientist who fled from Northern
Iraq as a

14:29.969 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
child, and now advocates on
behalf of fellow
refugees.

14:32.905 --> 14:38.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MORAD: We have noticed a
lot of activities
for the past week at least where
you have

14:38.277 --> 14:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nazis and racists crossing the
street and
demonstrating against the
refugees arriving

14:45.051 --> 14:48.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Sweden.

14:48.287 --> 14:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These are
right-wing vigilantes,
including football hooligans,
apparently attacking

14:55.762 --> 15:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants. This precinct is
where young Moroccans
hang out. Many have acquired a
reputation

15:05.271 --> 15:08.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as petty criminals and
troublemakers.

15:08.241 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack happened a few days
after a murder
at a young asylum seeker's
hostel in Western

15:12.979 --> 15:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sweden. A 22-year-old worker,
Alexandra Mezher,
originally from Lebanon, was
stabbed to death,

15:18.818 --> 15:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegedly by a young Somali,
after trying
to intervene in a fight. The
murder intensified

15:23.856 --> 15:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure on Prime Minister
Stefan Loven, whose
popularity has slumped despite
U-turns over

15:29.462 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his open door migration policy.

15:31.864 --> 15:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LOVEN, Swedish Prime
Minister (through
translator): I believe quite a
few people

15:36.903 --> 15:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Sweden now feel a great
worry there
will be more similar cases, as
Sweden accepts

15:41.507 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many unaccompanied minors.
Many of those
who come here to Sweden have had
traumatic

15:46.179 --> 15:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experiences, and there are no
simple answers.

15:49.015 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Fredrik Hagberg
is a leading
member of a far-right activist
group called

15:54.420 --> 15:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nordic Youth. He admits to
feeling sympathetic
towards the vigilantes.

15:58.224 --> 16:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK HAGBERG, Nordic Youth:
It's chaos
in Sweden. It's getting worse by
the minute.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like the gates of hell is
open. More
and more immigrants than we can
take care

16:07.333 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of is coming every day. The
violence is getting
more and more. Hatred against
Swedes, people

16:13.105 --> 16:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are getting bigger and bigger.
The women and
children are getting harassed
every day.

16:18.711 --> 16:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police can't be everywhere
at once. The
people need to do something by
themselves

16:23.149 --> 16:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if something is going to change.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It sounds like
you might
be advocating violence?

16:27.386 --> 16:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK HAGBERG: No, not at all,
not at all.
Our movement has always stood
against violence,

16:33.059 --> 16:35.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political violence, but I
believe in self-defense.

16:35.494 --> 16:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And this is one
of his organization's
videos.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Are you Nazis?

16:46.405 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREDRIK HAGBERG: No, not at all.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: How can you
prove that?

16:50.176 --> 16:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK HAGBERG: It's proved by
my actions,
or you just walk around. Look at
our Web site.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a program there,
manifest.

17:00.019 --> 17:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGNUS RANSTORP: I think the
greatest threat
Sweden is facing is that we have
an equal

17:06.025 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of extremism. We have a
lot of right-wing
extremism and, of course,
left-wing extremism.

17:11.230 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a sort of reciprocal
radicalization
going on. They are feeding and
fueling each

17:17.136 --> 17:18.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

17:18.971 --> 17:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is another
video which
has shed a light on the
atmosphere inside

17:22.108 --> 17:28.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some of the homes that
accommodate some 3,500
unaccompanied minors taken in by
Sweden. It

17:28.648 --> 17:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows the aftermath of an attack
on one young
boy. This is just one of what
the police say

17:33.352 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been 5,000 incidents at
asylum centers
that they have been called to
attend.

17:39.292 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anna Nellberg Dennis, deputy
chair of Sweden's
police union, says there have
been recent

17:43.930 --> 17:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problems west of Stockholm in
Vasteras.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA NELLBERG DENNIS, Deputy
Chair, Swedish
Police Union: We were down on
our knees, work-wise

17:48.868 --> 17:53.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and workload-wise, already long
before this
migration crisis and the terror
-- increased

17:53.239 --> 17:54.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorist threats.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I have about three cases in
the area
of Vastmanland where the biggest
city is Vasteras,

17:58.978 --> 18:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where police officers have been
forced to
push the alarm button because
they are surrounded

18:02.682 --> 18:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by angry immigrants that are
fighting each
other. The nice, secure and safe
country that

18:08.454 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we once had is not really that
nice anymore.

MALCOLM BRABANT: The area around
Stockholm's
central station is a magnet for
the Moroccans

18:15.962 --> 18:21.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and other asylum seekers.
Several hundred
young North Africans are facing
imminent deportation

18:21.434 --> 18:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after Sweden struck a deal with
the government
in Morocco.

18:24.971 --> 18:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to Europe's Criminal
Intelligence
Agency, at least 10,000
unaccompanied child

18:29.375 --> 18:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees have disappeared since
arriving in
the E.U. Many are feared to be
in the hands

18:34.280 --> 18:38.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of traffickers, or other
predators, according
to terrorism expert Magnus
Ranstorp.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGNUS RANSTORP: There is some
recruitment
by Islamic extremists at train
stations.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Today, Sweden's
Interior
Minister Anders Ygeman was
trying to project

18:47.526 --> 18:49.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an image of calm and control.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERS YGEMAN, Swedish Interior
Minister:
I think we have been bad
prepared for this

18:52.031 --> 19:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation. Our social system is
not made to
meet the demands from this
group. And we also

19:00.339 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a problem with returning
them to Morocco
if they don't have the right to
be in Sweden.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So how do you
think you're
doing?

19:09.548 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDERS YGEMAN: In the overall
picture, we're
doing quite well.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But that's not
what the police
union are saying. They say that
this is no

19:14.887 --> 19:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
longer the nice society it used
to be.

19:16.822 --> 19:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERS YGEMAN: Well, I think
even the police
union should look forward and
not backwards,

19:22.495 --> 19:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but if we want to compare the
figures and
stats backwards, we could say
that we haven't

19:28.300 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had this many policemen in 35
years.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: They say that
you need an
extra 4,000, and you're not
going to give

19:33.806 --> 19:35.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them enough.

19:35.641 --> 19:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERS YGEMAN: We have never had
this much
policemen. We have never had
this much money

19:39.745 --> 19:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fund the police as we have
now. And we
have a lower crime rate.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the wake of
these disturbances,
the Swedish government is to
launch a task

19:47.486 --> 19:51.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
force to crack down on
vigilantes who might
be thinking about taking the law
into their

19:51.957 --> 19:53.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own hands.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And to soften the blow of
deporting the young
North Africans, the government
is promising

19:57.630 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to set up a special center in
Morocco to house
them in safety and security.

20:02.768 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tina Morad is disturbed by the
sudden change
in Swedish policies.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MORAD: We have built up our
reputation
internationally of being this
humanitarian

20:10.109 --> 20:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role model. To change it that
drastically,
I don't believe that the
government has thought

20:14.713 --> 20:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through it properly, and I don't
believe that
they have any expectations of
how this might

20:19.518 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
affect Sweden in the near
future.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Iraqi civil
servant Adel
Ali Qatani has decided to return
to Baghdad

20:28.060 --> 20:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of new rules making it
more difficult
for refugees to bring over their
families.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADEL ALI QATANI, Refugee
(through translator):
I see no solution. I can't wait
for three

20:37.803 --> 20:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, because, at the end of
the day, I have
a problem about reuniting with
my son. In

20:42.541 --> 20:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three years, he will be an
adult. The laws
complicate matters.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although I'm very grateful for
all the help
I have been given, I feel very
frustrated

20:50.349 --> 20:54.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and insecure because of all the
uncertainty
the government is going through,
all these

20:54.320 --> 20:58.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different changes. It's better
to return to
my family and endure the
hardship with them,

20:59.058 --> 21:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than leaving them alone
there.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The migration
debate is dominating
the political landscape, and the
latest polls

21:04.697 --> 21:09.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
show rises for the main
center-right opposition
party, and in the lead are the
anti-immigrant

21:09.935 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Sweden Democrats. Their
integration spokesman
is Markus Wiechel.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARKUS WIECHEL, Sweden
Democrats: Well, society
is pretty much falling apart.
The government

21:16.976 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually taking money from
the foreign
aid budgets to fund refugees
coming to Sweden.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure I'm going to
call them refugees,
actually, because they have
crossed seven

21:26.919 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or eight more safe countries on
their way
to Sweden. They're economic
migrants. And

21:31.757 --> 21:38.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then it's not defendable to take
foreign aid
money to spend on the refugees.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Swedish
government is
hoping there will soon be a thaw
in widespread

21:42.168 --> 21:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European resistance towards
sharing what it
sees as its migrant burden. But,
if anything,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the climate towards refugees is
growing colder.

21:50.643 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Stockholm.

21:59.818 --> 22:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:07.760 --> 22:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
ethics of
creating three-parent babies;
when data and

22:13.732 --> 22:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money decides who gets medical
care and who
doesn't; and broad influence, a
look at how

22:20.339 --> 22:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women are changing the way
America works.
Yahoo

22:23.342 --> 22:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first: the tech giant Yahoo
in serious
trouble.

22:27.913 --> 22:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For months, and years, by some
accounts, the
company has struggled to
successfully define

22:32.885 --> 22:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a strategy to satisfy investors,
consumers
and the markets. Yesterday,
Yahoo CEO Marissa

22:39.358 --> 22:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayer said the company would
consider offers
for buying its core assets and
announced that

22:44.730 --> 22:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 percent of the work force
would be laid
off.

Douglas MacMillan of The Wall
Street Journal
joins me now.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to the program.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how much trouble is Yahoo.
in?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS MACMILLAN, The Wall
Street Journal:
It looks like we might be
finally entering

22:58.043 --> 23:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of the final chapter of
what is really
one of the most iconic companies
in Silicon

23:03.549 --> 23:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Valley and in the Internet.

23:05.417 --> 23:10.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yahoo began as kind of one of
the kind of
tentpoles of the Internet, the
place where

23:10.289 --> 23:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of people would go on
kind of find,
you know, news and sports and
information

23:14.893 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Web. But, as the world
has shifted
to kind of an Internet that's
focused around

23:19.698 --> 23:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
search and around mobile phones
and around
social networks, Yahoo has
really struggled

23:24.870 --> 23:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to kind of find an identity and
find, you
know, a business model in this
kind of new

23:29.875 --> 23:31.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
era of the Internet.

23:31.877 --> 23:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, particularly, the CEO the
past three-and-a-half
years, Marissa Mayer, has
struggled to kind

23:36.749 --> 23:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of reinvent Yahoo for kind of
this new era.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is a
company that
has, what, a billion people a
month going

23:44.723 --> 23:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to its Web site, using e-mail
and other services.
How does that square with all
these problems?

23:50.562 --> 23:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS MACMILLAN: Yes, they
have a billion
people collectively visiting
their Web properties,

23:54.800 --> 24:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, you know, not many of them
are regularly
checking in with Yahoo on their
mobile phones

24:01.006 --> 24:02.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a consistent basis.

24:02.908 --> 24:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, as we have seen with
Google and
with Facebook and with other
Internet companies

24:07.246 --> 24:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have successfully kind of
made the jump
to the mobile phone era, is
becoming kind

24:12.718 --> 24:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the basis of a successful,
you know, business
plan in 2016.

24:17.423 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned the
CEO, Marissa
Mayer. We quoted her, what she
said, a minute

24:23.962 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. How much of had is being
blamed on her?
We know some of the investors
are calling

24:29.168 --> 24:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her to be removed, but how
much of it
is her, and how much of it is
just this is

24:33.605 --> 24:38.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a sector that it's very
difficult to survive,
as you just described, in this
climate?

24:38.477 --> 24:43.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS MACMILLAN: Yes,
particularly I think
there's something to be said for
how difficult

24:43.949 --> 24:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a task it is to turn around an
Internet company,
a technology company that is in
decline, that

24:49.888 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is in freefall.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really almost never been
done in this
industry. So, perhaps, you know,
Marissa Mayer

24:55.761 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inherited or, you know, took on
an impossible
task. But, on the other hand,
when she did

25:00.299 --> 25:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
join the company three years
ago, there was
a lot of excitement, there was a
lot of enthusiasm

25:04.636 --> 25:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she brought to the company,
and people
wanted to work at Yahoo for the
first time

25:08.674 --> 25:10.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in over a decade.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think what we're seeing
right now, as
we're potentially neither the
end of kind

25:14.012 --> 25:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her tenure and the end of
Yahoo as an independent
company, is there's just a lot
of disappointment

25:20.252 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in what could have been, and,
you know, could
she have, you know, potentially
turned around

25:25.491 --> 25:27.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this company?

25:27.426 --> 25:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear, you know, what she
could have
done differently.

25:30.162 --> 25:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She's still
saying that it's
going to turn around.

25:33.232 --> 25:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS MACMILLAN: So it's
interesting what
she says and kind of what the
board is saying

25:38.804 --> 25:40.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

25:40.806 --> 25:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement yesterday that
Yahoo's pursuing
strategic alternatives seems to
indicate that

25:45.177 --> 25:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are seriously considering
putting this
company up for sale. And,
indeed, there are

25:51.116 --> 25:56.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bankers circling this company,
and potential
acquirers, who would like to buy
Yahoo, circling

25:57.055 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this company.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, whether it's just
for optics,
whether she's just putting on a
show, or wherever,

26:02.761 --> 26:06.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, Marissa really
believes she can
still turn this company around,
she has put

26:06.565 --> 26:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together a go-forward plan that
has reduced
some of the expenses. She cut --
she has planned

26:13.205 --> 26:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cut 15 percent of the work
force. She's
planned to close a few different
individual

26:18.110 --> 26:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
small business units, close a
few remote offices.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS MACMILLAN: But what
she's essentially
doing amounts to kind of
cleaning out the

26:24.516 --> 26:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attic, when what we're really
talking about
is a sale of the whole house.

26:28.120 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas MacMillan
of The Wall
Street Journal, thanks very
much.

DOUGLAS MACMILLAN: Thank you.

26:41.934 --> 26:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to questions
surrounding a
significant advance in
reproductive technology

26:50.309 --> 26:52.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with DNA and embryos.

26:52.444 --> 26:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The change on the horizon was
pioneered and
approved in England and it is
now being considered

26:57.149 --> 27:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for use in the U.S. Proponents
believe it
may eliminate dangerous disease
in children,

27:02.888 --> 27:05.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but others have raised ethical
concerns.

27:05.424 --> 27:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the National Academy of
Sciences recommended
that clinical trials go forward
in the U.S.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our look.

27:12.965 --> 27:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This new
technology is called
mitochondrial replacement
technique, or MRT

27:17.870 --> 27:19.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for shot.

27:19.705 --> 27:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitochondria are tiny structures
that exist
in nearly all the cells in our
bodies, and

27:23.108 --> 27:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have their own unique DNA. The
problem is,
a very small number of women
have defective

27:27.813 --> 27:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mitochondria, and if they have
children, those
kids inherit their mom's
mitochondria and

27:32.918 --> 27:37.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can suffer terrible, sometimes
fatal, problems,
including brain damage and heart
failure.

27:37.756 --> 27:42.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This new technology would, in
essence, replace
that original mitochondria in
either the mother's

27:42.494 --> 27:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
egg or in the parents' embryo
with healthy
mitochondria from a third
person. A child

27:47.766 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
born this way would then be
carrying the DNA
of three different people.

27:51.503 --> 27:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier today, patient advocate
Laurie Strongin
told us why the advance was so
important for

27:56.475 --> 27:58.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a small group of parents.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURIE STRONGIN, Patient
Advocate: One of
the things that we have found is
that parents'

28:01.413 --> 28:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desire to have genetically
related offspring
is a widely held desire. It's
not universal,

28:09.388 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it's widely held.

28:11.690 --> 28:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the potential to use MRT to
have offspring
who are genetically related to
both parents

28:23.335 --> 28:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something that families who
carry mtDNA
disease really want. And not
everyone is going

28:30.642 --> 28:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pursue it, but for the family
for whom
having children who are -- who
have a nuclear

28:37.249 --> 28:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genetic connection to them, this
is something
that will just be one of
numerous options

28:42.955 --> 28:44.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
available to them.

28:44.823 --> 28:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Joining me now
to discuss
the technology and its
implications are Johns

28:48.393 --> 28:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hopkins bioethics Professor
Jeffrey Kahn,
who chairs the panel at the
National Academy

28:52.798 --> 28:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Medicine that recommended
moving forward
with the technology, and Marcy
Darnovsky,

28:57.903 --> 29:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who writes widely on these
issues and is the
executive director of the Center
for Genetics

29:01.807 --> 29:02.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Society.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Jeffrey Kahn, I would like
to start with
you.

29:04.943 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if you could just tell
us a little
bit more about this technology.
To my ear,

29:09.281 --> 29:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this sounds like what we know of
as some sort
of modified version of in vitro
fertilization.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us a little bit
more? What is
this technology?

29:16.922 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY KAHN, Johns Hopkins
University: Yes.

29:18.857 --> 29:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, in fact, a modified
version of in vitro
fertilization, as you noted.
However, it's

29:23.829 --> 29:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picking up the nuclear DNA, the
DNA that we
think of as creating the traits
that make

29:30.369 --> 29:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us who we are, and picking that
up and putting
it into a healthy environment of
mitochondria.

29:34.473 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you noted in the intro, there
are women
who suffer from mutations in
addition those

29:40.479 --> 29:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mitochondrial DNA that will
cause really terrible
diseases in their offspring. So,
this is a

29:45.217 --> 29:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to avoid that and preserve
the genetic
relationship. The difference, or
the challenges,

29:51.523 --> 29:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this has never before been done
in a human.

29:54.426 --> 30:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the FDA, which is charged
with regulating
license applications in new
areas like this,

30:01.600 --> 30:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked the National Academy of
Medicine to
hold the consensus committee to
evaluate the

30:06.672 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ethics, social, and policy
issues related
to this technology.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the report that was
released today.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, just so --
I know there
are some viewers who are
wondering. We're

30:15.947 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not talking about tweaking the
DNA that affects
our hair color or our
intelligence or things

30:21.119 --> 30:21.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY KAHN: No, that's right.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the mitochondria actually
are quite
important. Otherwise, there
wouldn't be this

30:26.892 --> 30:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need, because people who have
defective mitochondria
have terrible disease issues.
So, mitochondria

30:32.631 --> 30:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create energy for every cell in
our body.
And they also have some other
implications

30:37.369 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the cellular development
level.

30:39.638 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, no, it isn't actually a
way to change
the things we think of as making
us who we

30:45.610 --> 30:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, eye color, hair color. You
mentioned
intelligence, athletic ability,
all the kinds

30:50.649 --> 30:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things we might think of in
the so-called
designer baby problems. It
wouldn't do that.

30:55.253 --> 30:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really picking up a healthy
population
of mitochondria and replacing
that for those

30:59.124 --> 31:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are diseased, and a way
forward which
we think we have crafted which
allows a responsible,

31:05.931 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ethically acceptable way
forward, but with
great precaution and numerous
restrictions.

31:12.571 --> 31:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm just
curious. We mentioned
this is a relatively small
number of people

31:16.208 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who would use this. How many
people are we
talking about?

31:17.976 --> 31:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY KAHN: In the hundreds of
people, so
not -- across the entire
country. And part

31:22.948 --> 31:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that is because it's a very
homogeneous
disease.

31:25.884 --> 31:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really hard to detect and
diagnose, and
only a small number of people
have a severe

31:31.656 --> 31:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough version that we know for
sure that
they're going to pass it on and
that the children

31:35.360 --> 31:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are born will be affected.
That said,
they very desperately want to
have a way to

31:41.133 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have children who are related to
them.

31:43.235 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The alternative for those
individuals, otherwise,
is adoption, not having
children, or egg donation.

31:49.207 --> 31:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is a different thing
for those individuals.
And it's an area we thought
needed to be respected

31:53.678 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the part of people who wanted
it.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Marcy Darnovsky,
I want to turn to you.

31:57.716 --> 32:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you have some concerns
about this technology.
What is it that troubles you?

32:01.153 --> 32:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY DARNOVSKY, Center for
Genetics and Society:
Well, I think for people who are
in the situation

32:06.024 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has just been described,
they have to
make a very difficult decision
about whether

32:11.062 --> 32:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to subject their future child to
the risks
of what's really a quite
biologically extreme

32:17.536 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
procedure, whether that's worth
what their
-- their preference to have a
genetically

32:23.308 --> 32:25.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
related child is.

32:25.243 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All people that have this
problem, this terrible
problem, can have healthy
children, children

32:30.582 --> 32:35.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are not affected by these
mitochondrial
diseases, in the ways that Jeff
just mentioned,

32:35.854 --> 32:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some of them can actually
use an embryo
screening technology as well.
And that would

32:39.724 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
further reduce the number of
people who would
be candidates for this
procedure.

32:44.462 --> 32:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for the rest of us, I
think we have
to weigh the preferences of
those -- that

32:49.901 --> 32:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small number of people for a
genetically related
child against -- which is a
benefit, but it's

32:55.907 --> 33:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a social benefit, not really a
medical benefit,
because it's not about healthy
children.

33:01.413 --> 33:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to weigh that against
the big deal
it is to do this for the first
time, to make

33:07.586 --> 33:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes that would be passed
down to future
generations. And this problem of
whether we

33:13.692 --> 33:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should do it or not is a subject
right now
of huge controversy around a
different technique

33:19.264 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called gene editing.

33:21.700 --> 33:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on that technique, the
conclusion of a
500-person meeting that was held
in December

33:26.771 --> 33:32.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was that it would be
irresponsible to proceed
unless and until there was a
broad, societal

33:32.477 --> 33:34.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consensus that it would be OK.

33:34.746 --> 33:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, the
committee, although
I appreciate very much the
cautions and the

33:40.018 --> 33:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limitations that they have
recommended, but
this committee is saying it's OK
to go forward

33:44.923 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jeffrey, what
do you make
of that? Is this the slippery
slope to gene

33:48.927 --> 33:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
editing or some of these more
troubling outcomes?

33:51.396 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY KAHN: I would say no,
and here's why.

33:55.667 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Marcy rightly pointed out,
there are real
concerns about crossing the germ
line, so

34:00.205 --> 34:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creating genetic modifications
that could
be inherited by future
generations. And among

34:05.143 --> 34:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recommendations in our
report was that
the initial investigations be
limited to the

34:09.514 --> 34:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
implantation of male embryos,
because the
mitochondrial DNA is only passed
from mother

34:14.753 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to offspring.

34:16.621 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So by limiting the offspring to
males, you
wouldn't allow that germ line
modification

34:21.192 --> 34:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to happen. There would be no
possibility of
passing those alterations to
future generations.

34:26.498 --> 34:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we thought we could find a
way to allow
people who very much wanted to
have genetically

34:32.270 --> 34:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
related offspring to pursue a
new reproductive
technology.

34:36.207 --> 34:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
say there are
many new reproductive
technologies introduced

34:40.045 --> 34:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country and around the
world that
do not get this level of
scrutiny. This is

34:44.115 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first time the Food and Drug
Administration
in our country has, from the
beginning, prior

34:48.386 --> 34:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the initial investigation of
a new reproductive
technology, has asked for this
level of scrutiny,

34:54.192 --> 34:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, depending on what they do
with the recommendations
from this report, implement them
in a way

34:58.196 --> 35:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will really control the
introduction
of a new technology of this
sort.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marcy, what do
you make
of that? Do you feel that the
conditions can

35:06.037 --> 35:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be placed on this technology to
keep it in
check that would make you
comfortable with

35:10.375 --> 35:12.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

35:12.210 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY DARNOVSKY: Well, the
condition that
I would like to see placed on
this before

35:15.981 --> 35:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we go forward would be for the
United States
to join the dozens of other
countries around

35:21.219 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world that have actually
written laws
saying that we're not going to
alter the nuclear

35:25.957 --> 35:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DNA that's passed down to our
children and
future generations.

35:29.861 --> 35:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that would make us able
to evaluate
this technology in a better way.
And the limitations

35:37.669 --> 35:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are better than nothing, but
they are temporary,
as the report notes, and I think
we're already

35:43.975 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing this approval being
characterized as
a green light for going ahead,
and it's being

35:51.683 --> 35:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used as an argument for doing
the full-out
kinds of genetic engineering
that would create

35:57.922 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the designer baby scenarios.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
this is a very
interesting discussion.

36:02.093 --> 36:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marcy Darnovsky and Jeffrey
Kahn, thank you
both very much for being here.

36:06.898 --> 36:11.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY KAHN: Thank you.

36:11.703 --> 36:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCY DARNOVSKY: Thank you.

36:16.474 --> 36:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: using big
data to assess
medical treatments and
interventions and whether

36:24.482 --> 36:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
decisions for individual
patients are the
right choice for all of society.

36:29.421 --> 36:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not necessarily seen as
the right way
of making decisions in science
and medicine

36:34.159 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when lives are at stake. But
some believe
it's a critical consideration.

36:38.797 --> 36:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent Miles
O'Brien looks
at how some thinkers in the
field are challenging

36:44.436 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long-held assumptions.

36:46.271 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The story was produced in
collaboration with
the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting.

36:52.977 --> 37:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is where the
line between
life and death is drawn, an
operating room

37:02.153 --> 37:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a hospital in a remote part
of Nepal.

37:05.523 --> 37:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Shree Ram Tiwari is
performing one of
the first C-sections in this
part of the world,

37:12.230 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping to save the lives of Muna
Buhl (ph)
and her unborn child. It's not
going smoothly.

37:21.806 --> 37:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHREE RAM TIWARI, Physician
(through translator):
The power cut out at such an
important time,

37:28.880 --> 37:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the baby should keep
crying after
it's born, but it wasn't. We
needed power

37:35.854 --> 37:38.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the suction machine.

37:38.189 --> 37:43.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bringing
C-sections to this
remote corner comes not only
with risks, but

37:43.795 --> 37:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also a hefty price tag. The
bills are paid
by Possible, the American
charity that runs

37:50.101 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hospital.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHREE RAM TIWARI (through
translator):
Nepal's constitution talks about
health rights,

37:54.873 --> 38:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that every person should have
access to health
care. But that is not
implemented.

38:00.512 --> 38:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While mother and
child remain
the focus for Dr. Tiwari as he
copes with

38:07.051 --> 38:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the power failure, the global
health community
tries to shed light on whether
this surgery

38:13.658 --> 38:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should have happened at all.

38:17.896 --> 38:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical ethicist Peter Singer is
a professor
at Princeton University. He is a
leading proponent

38:23.835 --> 38:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a philosophy called effective
altruism.

38:26.237 --> 38:29.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER SINGER, Princeton
University: Effective
altruists look for those health
care programs

38:29.841 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
worldwide that offer the
low-hanging fruit.
Where can you save lives most
cheaply?

38:35.480 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Effective
altruists like Dr.
Singer compare different
interventions, and

38:40.285 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choose the one that provides the
most bang
for the buck. They might elect
to pay for

38:45.089 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community health workers, rather
than operating
rooms.

38:48.760 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But human beings are not wired
to respond
in this dispassionate,
systematic manner.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is why commercial appeals
for charities
often look like this:

38:58.736 --> 39:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Tiny, vulnerable Aisha
won't eat
tonight or tomorrow. She is
slowly dying.

39:06.511 --> 39:12.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER SINGER: We are
psychologically adapted
to respond to individuals who we
can see.

39:12.217 --> 39:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But health care is a scarce
resource. So,
data is absolutely critical. We
can't know

39:17.455 --> 39:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're using our resources
in the best
way possible without data.

39:22.026 --> 39:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Chris Murray
agrees. That's
why he is crunching the numbers,
in an unprecedented

39:29.667 --> 39:31.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY, Founder
and Director,
Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation:

39:33.037 --> 39:34.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have a 20,000-core
supercomputer, which
is pretty ginormous.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Big data meets
modern medicine.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY: If you
could identify
all the bits of information out
there, then

39:40.945 --> 39:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would be in the strongest
possible position
to empower people to make better
decisions.

39:46.384 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Murray is founder
and director
of the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation,

39:52.590 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a nonprofit that caters to other
nonprofits
seeking to place smart bets.

39:58.129 --> 40:04.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's the global health
equivalent of legendary
baseball manager Billy Beane,
who first applied

40:04.369 --> 40:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big data to the Major Leagues, a
story told
in the 2011 movie "Moneyball."

40:09.540 --> 40:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You don't put a team
together with
a computer, Billy.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD PITT, Actor: No?

40:14.379 --> 40:16.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: No. Baseball isn't just
numbers.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD PITT: Adapt or die.

40:18.683 --> 40:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY: The
difference is
we're not worried about winning
the World

40:22.253 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Series. We're interested in, how
do you make
people healthier?

40:25.590 --> 40:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The data shows
that, globally,
infectious diseases, the red
boxes, are on

40:31.162 --> 40:37.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the decline. The U.S. was
declared free of
polio back in 1979. But some
countries continue

40:37.935 --> 40:39.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to lag far behind.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY: Go to
Niger. Whoa.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wow.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY: Let's
see. There you
go. There's where...

40:44.242 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's as
dramatic as it gets,
huh?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY: We know
how to get
rid of infectious diseases,
right, whether

40:48.446 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through public health or through
medicine.
And so this is addressable.

40:52.050 --> 40:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Quantity is one
thing, but
it's harder to measure a
person's quality

40:56.854 --> 41:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life. So, Murray created a
new metric,
the Disability-Adjusted Life
Year, or DALY.

41:04.495 --> 41:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The equation is simple, the
number of years
lost to a premature death, plus
the number

41:09.834 --> 41:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of years of good health lost to
a disease
or injury. DALYs make it
possible to measure

41:16.607 --> 41:22.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the impact of different
interventions and
show that some hit a lot more
home runs.

41:22.714 --> 41:27.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY:
Individual clinical
care is great for that patient.
You change

41:27.452 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their lives. But you don't
change the circumstances
of their health, and if you want
to do that,

41:31.956 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have got to see the bigger
picture.

41:33.825 --> 41:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the U.S., the
Affordable
Care Act prohibits Medicare from
using tools

41:38.796 --> 41:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the DALY to ration health
care. Rationing
is considered a dirty word, but
Dr. Singer

41:45.203 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says the U.S. system is infused
with it.

41:48.172 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SINGER: We don't call it
that. We deny
it. But, I mean, I think it's a
crazy system.

41:53.478 --> 41:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He offers the
story of Martin
Shkreli as a case in point. In
September,

41:58.583 --> 42:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pharmaceutical executive
became a poster
boy for greed in U.S. medical
care when he

42:03.688 --> 42:11.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
raised the price of an
anti-parasitic drug
from $13.50 to $750 per pill.

42:11.929 --> 42:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SINGER: By denying the
existence of
rationing, we're just writing a
blank check

42:15.700 --> 42:22.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to whatever financial
sharpshooter comes in
and sees an opportunity to make
outrageous

42:22.173 --> 42:23.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
profits.

42:24.008 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Outside the U.S.,
there is
less concern about applying big
data to medicine

42:27.512 --> 42:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the form of DALYs. Mexico was
an early
adopter.

42:32.850 --> 42:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Studies showed they should focus
on things
that may not kill, but cause a
great deal

42:36.587 --> 42:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ill health, like depression
and traffic
injuries. And, in Africa, there
has been a

42:42.226 --> 42:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dramatic decline in the DALYs
lost to malaria.

42:45.229 --> 42:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SINGER: This has saved
millions of lives,
and that has been largely
data-driven.

42:51.135 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But on the front
lines, a statistic
becomes a patient, and things
are less cut

42:57.742 --> 42:59.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and dried.

42:59.977 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Guatemala, Crecencia Buch
(ph) is battling
for her life, threatened by
cervical cancer.

43:05.450 --> 43:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRECENCIA BUCH, Cancer Sufferer
(through translator):
I was told I have cancer, and I
only have

43:12.290 --> 43:14.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seven months to live.

43:14.325 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That was back in
2012. An American
NGO, the Maya Health Alliance,
has since spent

43:21.232 --> 43:28.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost $10,000 on radiation
therapy, buying
Crecencia few extra years with
her children,

43:28.773 --> 43:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and now her grandchildren.

43:32.310 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the sort of heartwarming
image that
has most donors diving for their
wallets.

43:37.615 --> 43:41.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But Peter Singer and the
effective altruists
remain unmoved.

43:41.118 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SINGER: If you have data
showing that
you will save more lives through
doing something

43:47.458 --> 43:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else, then you should do the
most good you
can.

43:50.561 --> 43:54.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The DALY bottom
line suggests
the money would have had more
impact if it

43:55.032 --> 44:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been spent on something
else, like Pap
smears to catch cervical cancer
early.

44:01.539 --> 44:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some say DALYs are nothing
more than a
magic bullet approach that is
destined to

44:08.713 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fail.
DR. Peter Rohloff is founder of
the Maya Health
Alliance. He made the call to
fund Crecencia's

44:16.120 --> 44:17.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PETER ROHLOFF, Founder, Maya
Health Alliance:
Giving a mother four years with
her children

44:20.024 --> 44:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is precisely a conversation
about living and
not a conversation just about
not dying.

44:26.097 --> 44:30.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Rohloff
believes not everything
can be captured by numbers.

44:30.434 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PETER ROHLOFF: We should use
big data,
right? We should be making smart
decisions

44:33.237 --> 44:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how we spend our money.
But the other
half of the global health
equation is the

44:38.042 --> 44:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right to health care. Dreaming
about your
life and where you want your
life to go is

44:43.848 --> 44:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a basic human right, and we need
to, I think,
include that in our algorithm,
if such a thing

44:49.520 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were possible, right?

44:51.455 --> 44:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Back in Nepal,
Shree Ram Tiwari
works to resuscitate Muna's baby
without power.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHREE RAM TIWARI (through
translator):
When there is no power, we have
a manually

45:00.898 --> 45:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operated suction device which
works by breathing
with your mouth.

45:05.202 --> 45:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The baby's lungs
fill with
air, and a cry echoes through
the operating

45:11.208 --> 45:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room. The lives of both mother
and child are
saved, just as the lights come
back on.

45:22.019 --> 45:28.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, a year-and-a-half on,
we received
this photo of Muna's baby,
Malishka (ph).

45:28.125 --> 45:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She may soon have a sibling, as
Muna is pregnant
again. There are no numbers that
can adequately

45:36.567 --> 45:43.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
convey the value of this
hospital, in this
place, for this family.

45:43.174 --> 45:50.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour."

45:50.715 --> 45:58.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

45:59.090 --> 46:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recently sat down with Jay
Newton-Small.
She is a Washington
correspondent for "TIME,"

46:04.662 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
magazine and she's author of
"Broad Influence:
How Women Are Changing the Way
America Works."

46:12.169 --> 46:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jay Newton-Small, welcome.

46:14.071 --> 46:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL, Author, "Broad
Influence:
How Women Are Changing the Way
America Works":

46:14.605 --> 46:16.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I guess there's
no confusing
what broad refers to here,
right?

46:18.342 --> 46:20.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:20.277 --> 46:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: No. It's
actually referring
to women. And I don't know if
you knew this,

46:22.279 --> 46:26.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but broad used to be a pretty
derogatory term
for women, which we're hoping to
sort of reclaim

46:26.851 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it a little bit, but it used to
apply to our
hips, because we have broad
hips, because

46:31.522 --> 46:32.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we bear children.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And of course we bear children.
We should
be proud of that fact.

46:34.859 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I
absolutely remember
when it was considered a
derogatory term.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But times are changing.

46:40.498 --> 46:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jay Newton-Small, you do a lot
of reporting
here on how women are doing.
What's really

46:45.636 --> 46:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting, though, is how you
document women
have to reach a certain level, a
critical

46:51.676 --> 46:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mass, so to speak, before things
really change.
And you reported on the U.S.
Congress. Talk

46:56.781 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about that and what you found.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: Sure.

46:59.917 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the book actually grew from
a story that
I did for "TIME" magazine about
two years

47:03.421 --> 47:08.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ago during the government
shutdown, where
the 20 women at that point of
the 100-member

47:08.759 --> 47:13.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Senate got together and
restarted the
negotiations to reopen the
government, when

47:13.597 --> 47:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
none of the men would talk to
each other.

47:15.633 --> 47:21.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that -- I really was
interested in that
session, because those 20 women
ended up producing

47:21.405 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 75 percent of the
major legislation
that passed that session. They
really batted

47:25.376 --> 47:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well above they are weight. And
I got -- it
turns out there's this theory of
critical

47:31.382 --> 47:33.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mass.

47:33.350 --> 47:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, somewhere between 20 percent
and 30 percent,
women really begin to change an
institution,

47:37.121 --> 47:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's a legislature or a
corporate
board, a Navy ship or an
appellate court.

47:41.726 --> 47:45.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I started looking at
all those corners
and finding other areas where
women had reached

47:45.629 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this sort of tipping point, and
they were
really beginning to change the
way we govern,

47:49.300 --> 47:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change the way we manage, change
the way we
command.

47:51.435 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it about
the 20 or
30 percent? Why isn't it 50
percent?

47:55.706 --> 48:00.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: So, it's
interesting. You
know, one woman really is a
token. Two or

48:00.678 --> 48:05.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 percent -- or, like, sort of
less than
20 percent are considered kind
of a pair.

48:05.282 --> 48:08.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's -- there have been a
ton of studies
that show -- or at least two
studies that

48:08.552 --> 48:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can think of that show that
pairs are actually
worse than either having one or
three, because

48:12.590 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either the women are considered
conspiratorial
or they're considered sort of
archenemies.

48:17.762 --> 48:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's this strange kind of, I
don't know
what's going on with the two.

48:20.965 --> 48:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you start getting a
plurality of
the women, three or more,
depending on the

48:25.069 --> 48:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size of the institution, that's
when you really
begin -- women's voices are
considered less

48:30.541 --> 48:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exceptional, and it's not this
weird thing,
like, where are you coming from?
And it becomes

48:34.011 --> 48:38.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
less -- sort of less
objectifying them, and
more sort of normal, like
brother and sister

48:38.115 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or normal work areas.

48:39.984 --> 48:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what did you
find that
women want to do differently
from men? Where

48:44.922 --> 48:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does the policy change or the
direction of
an organization change because
of women who

48:50.995 --> 48:52.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are making decisions?

48:52.129 --> 48:54.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: It depends on
the organization.

48:54.431 --> 48:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's been a lot of great
research,
one that shows that women tend
to be a lot

48:58.202 --> 49:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more prepared than men. They
tend to really
want to dig in on an issue.
Women ask the

49:02.006 --> 49:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard questions and say, where's
the accounting?
Where's the money going? How is
it being spent?

49:07.678 --> 49:11.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women also tend to be more
collaborative.
They tend to look for win-win
situations,

49:11.949 --> 49:17.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where everybody can win,
everyone can advance
together, whereas men can be --
not all men,

49:17.421 --> 49:21.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but a lot of men can be sort of
zero-sum game,
I win, you lose.

49:21.425 --> 49:24.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, those are two sort of very
common aspects
of...

49:24.361 --> 49:26.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:26.197 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's not as
if all women
agree on the direction things
should go.

49:28.265 --> 49:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: No, and -- not
at all.

49:30.201 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, you see that in
the Senate.
For example, you had Senator
Kirsten Gillibrand

49:34.839 --> 49:39.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from New York and Claire
McCaskill from Missouri
disagreeing over how to do
sexual assault

49:39.677 --> 49:41.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the military bill.

49:41.579 --> 49:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is the great joy of
having enough
women to disagree. Right? You
don't have to

49:45.516 --> 49:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all be on the same page to go
places. But
what you have to do is respect
each other.

49:49.320 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, notably, when they
disagreed, they
agreed not to recriminate each
other, not

49:53.457 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to like sling accusations or
insults. They
just said, we disagree, but we
still appreciate

49:59.797 --> 50:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
each other's perspectives.

50:01.699 --> 50:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was struck that
the one area
where you said there doesn't
seem to be change

50:04.735 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they get to critical mass
is the private
sector. And you looked at the
financial industry.

50:08.672 --> 50:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a quote from a
woman who had
been on several corporate
boards. She said:

50:13.077 --> 50:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"There's a trend. When women and
money penetrate
a sector, the money and power
leaves it."

50:19.550 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said: "When women finally
got into investment
banking, all the money went to
private equity.

50:23.320 --> 50:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When women got into private
equity, it went
to hedge funds."

50:27.124 --> 50:29.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, why is it different?

50:29.560 --> 50:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: I don't know
that it's the
men are -- I can't say that
they're, like,

50:33.764 --> 50:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conspiring -- conspiring to keep
women out
of it.

50:36.834 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what -- it is the sense
that, when you
are diversifying, when the power
structure

50:42.873 --> 50:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no longer the people that
look exactly
like you, it moves beyond the
sort of core

50:47.678 --> 50:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of a certain number of
people, that
that makes some people
uncomfortable. It makes

50:52.750 --> 50:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many -- certain people leave,
start different
industries, start to do
different things.

50:58.055 --> 51:01.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are chasing the money,
but, to some
degree -- like, you see this
also in medicine,

51:01.525 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example. When women weren't
allowed into
medicine, and then they were
finally allowed

51:05.296 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into pediatrics, right, and all
the, like,
money left pediatrics. And then
women were

51:09.199 --> 51:12.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finally allowed into some kind
of surgery,
but the kinds of surgery they're
in are not

51:12.636 --> 51:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the kinds that all the money is
made.

51:14.505 --> 51:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is striking. It's an
interesting
phenomenon. And I don't know
what that says

51:19.076 --> 51:20.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about our culture.

51:20.344 --> 51:23.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it raises
some interesting
questions.

51:23.380 --> 51:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, Jay Newton-Small, you
say you're
hopeful about the future. Why?

51:28.152 --> 51:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: Well, so, it
was economic
necessity that first brought
women into the

51:32.523 --> 51:35.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
work force with Rosie the
Riveter during World
War II.

51:35.759 --> 51:39.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it wasn't until 1970 that
all of the laws
banning married women from
working without

51:39.897 --> 51:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their husband's permission were
fully repealed.
And I think it will be economic
necessity

51:44.268 --> 51:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that brings women to the work
force now, fully.
And you see that. We're right on
the cusp

51:48.305 --> 51:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it. So, by 2030, the baby
boomer generation
will fully retire and we will be
short 26

51:53.944 --> 51:55.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
million workers.

51:55.879 --> 51:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's only two ways to make up
that shortfall.
One, you bring in a ton of new
immigrants,

51:58.382 --> 52:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is really hard to imagine
with this
Congress. Or, two, you bring
women up to full

52:02.586 --> 52:06.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employment. And that is a lot
easier -- much
more easily done. There's plenty
of qualified

52:06.957 --> 52:10.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women who can do it. We make up
more than
half of the college degrees
already. And so

52:10.961 --> 52:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it will be easy to -- much
easier to do that.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's 15
years away, but
maybe things will change in the
meantime.

52:16.033 --> 52:17.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: I'm betting on
it.

52:17.534 --> 52:18.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:18.302 --> 52:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jay Newton-Small.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The book is "Broad Influence."

52:21.839 --> 52:23.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

52:23.841 --> 52:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY NEWTON-SMALL: Thank you,
Judy.

52:31.982 --> 52:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
