JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a health
care story about providing
help to those who need it most.

00:04.766 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even as the debate over
replacing the Affordable
Care Act continues,
one California city has

00:11.266 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
come up with an
innovative solution to
an intractable problem.

00:14.833 --> 00:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent
Kathleen McCleery reports
from Alameda County.

00:18.733 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: On the south
edge of the city of Hayward sits
a neighborhood with especially

00:25.033 --> 00:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high rates of poverty,
unemployment and violent crime.

00:28.233 --> 00:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are sicker, too.

00:30.100 --> 00:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many suffer from
diabetes, obesity, asthma
and other ailments.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Options for care
here are limited.

00:36.166 --> 00:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just one hospital,
and few doctors welcome
Medicaid patients.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some call it a
health care desert.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE, Former Director,
Alameda County Health Care
Services: South Hayward is the

00:45.700 --> 00:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poster child for lack of
access to primary care.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: When Alex
Briscoe was with Alameda County
Health Care Services -- he

00:51.433 --> 00:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was agency director for six
years -- he hunted for ways
to improve access to care.

00:58.466 --> 01:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, as he coped with the
swine flu, or H1N1, epidemic,
Briscoe had a light bulb moment.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: Firefighters
joined our public health nurses
and many other providers, and

01:09.333 --> 01:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we very successfully
vaccinated, immunized hundreds
of thousands of people.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Airway aids
and tracheal tubes.

01:16.533 --> 01:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Briscoe
wondered if firefighters
skilled as trained
paramedics could help solve

01:22.733 --> 01:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another piece of the
health care puzzle.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: This H1N1
experience, combined with our
already robust relationship with

01:28.600 --> 01:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fire on the EMS system,
it's kind of like peanut
butter and chocolate.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do these two ideas go together,
and is there a way for us
to use this already existing

01:37.400 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resource and preexisting
trust as well?

01:40.500 --> 01:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Trust,
because approval ratings for
firefighters far exceed other

01:45.066 --> 01:47.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public servants.

01:47.200 --> 01:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That got officials here
thinking about how to leverage
manpower and location.

01:54.066 --> 01:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kristel Acacio runs special
projects for the county agency.

01:56.766 --> 01:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO, Alameda County
Health Care Services Agency:
Fire stations, firefighters

01:59.666 --> 02:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are strategically located
in every community.

02:02.766 --> 02:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we saw this as an existing,
but perhaps untapped resource
to serve our patient population.

02:11.233 --> 02:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Around the fire station,
there is a concentration
of low-income residents.

02:15.533 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: When Acacio
examined data about that
population, she discovered that

02:22.533 --> 02:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the neediest area was just
where the county planned to
build a new fire station.

02:24.900 --> 02:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO: And what we
can see in this map is that
in Hayward, and in particular

02:28.933 --> 02:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in South Hayward, that
the concentration of
avoidable emergency
department visits is 1.5

02:35.566 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
times or greater
the county rate.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: County
health officials seized the
chance to collaborate with the

02:41.033 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city, a community health center
and a nonprofit architectural
firm to design and build two

02:46.966 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
structures on the same campus.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They opened in late 2015.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The clinic is right in
front of us, and the fire
station is right here.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS, Hayward Fire
Chief: Yes, the same style.

02:57.500 --> 03:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look integrated, and
basically taking advantage of
that sort of known trust and

03:03.333 --> 03:05.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
location.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Fire
chief Garrett Contreras was
a supporter from the start.

03:08.766 --> 03:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS: Upwards of
70 percent of our 911 calls
in the Hayward Fire Department

03:13.033 --> 03:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are for medical emergencies.

03:15.100 --> 03:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of these more routine-type
medical problems can be treated
at a much lower-cost setting

03:21.900 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and keep the emergency
room beds available for
our most critical patients.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Reducing
the number of transports to
the E.R. is one way to measure

03:30.333 --> 03:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success, says David B.
Vliet, CEO of the Tiburcio
Vasquez Health Center,
which runs eight community

03:37.166 --> 03:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clinics, including this one.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID B. VLIET, CEO, Tiburcio
Vasquez Health Center: Because
we have delivered 6,000 urgent

03:41.866 --> 03:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care, convenient care visits
here, those are visits that
didn't go to the E.R., so right

03:48.466 --> 03:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
away we know we have
kept that volume out
of the emergency room.

03:50.866 --> 03:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: But
not everything went
according to plan.

03:53.566 --> 03:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO: Initially, what
we wanted the firefighters to
do was that we could possibly

03:58.333 --> 04:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dedicate a couple paramedics
to actually work in the clinic.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: That idea
was quickly squelched by the
California Nurses Association.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Karen Rothblatt has been
a nurse for 30 years.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN ROTHBLATT, California
Nurses Association: You wouldn't
want me to come and respond to

04:13.866 --> 04:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you in that critical
first moment.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not what my
training is about.

04:19.133 --> 04:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Same, turn that around, I
think you could say that a
paramedic hasn't been trained to

04:24.066 --> 04:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do what a nurse has been
trained to do, so why would
you have them do that?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it would be
putting people at risk.

04:31.666 --> 04:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: My first thought
is the "Family Feud sound.

04:35.266 --> 04:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, no nurse would say that
while a paramedic is trache-ing
them or starting an I.V. line

04:42.166 --> 04:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paramedics are extremely highly
trained, and highly skilled,
and I think that they can

04:44.800 --> 04:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do far more than what they're
currently doing, if we remember
that the point of our health

04:49.800 --> 04:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care delivery system is to
serve people, not to protect
health care market share.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN ROTHBLATT: Well, I find
that insulting, actually.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are jobs out
there for nurses.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not about that.

05:01.233 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really, really about
making sure that that clinic
really functions in a way that

05:07.333 --> 05:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is best for the patients
that arrive there.

05:09.866 --> 05:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: At
the clinic, patients
are seen by a nurse
practitioner or physician's

05:17.666 --> 05:19.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assistant.

05:19.366 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
No doctor is on staff
yet, but they say they
are hiring one soon.

05:25.866 --> 05:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Firefighters are close by if
the clinic needs lifesaving
care for heart attacks, strokes

05:28.666 --> 05:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or to get patients to a
fully staffed emergency room.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And proximity promotes
communication, too.

05:36.633 --> 05:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those in the field, like Captain
LaShon Earnest, encourage
people to use the clinic.

05:41.066 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CAPT.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LASHON EARNEST, Hayward
Fire Department: We go on
a lot of calls where we
can make a determination

05:46.200 --> 05:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where somebody who doesn't
necessarily need to go
to the emergency room,
the tax the system.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For something -- say,
for a stubbed toe, this
is someone that could
probably use the clinic.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, did you know the
clinic was right next
door to the firehouse?

05:56.533 --> 05:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, I didn't know that.

05:58.266 --> 05:59.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, maybe I'm fine
right now, I don't need
to go to the hospital.

06:01.466 --> 06:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will have my mother drive
me tomorrow to the clinic.

06:04.933 --> 06:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Tina
Greives lost her insurance
after an on-the- job
injury as a long-distance

06:10.666 --> 06:12.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trucker.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For her, the location, next to
the fire station, is convenient.

06:15.400 --> 06:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA GREIVES, Patient: I don't
have a vehicle, which is unusual
for somebody in California.

06:20.333 --> 06:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one is just seriously
within walking distance if
I'm doing good, or a 15-minute

06:25.933 --> 06:26.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bus ride.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's in a perfect location.

06:28.866 --> 06:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Greives,
like most treated in this
clinic, qualifies for Medicaid.

06:35.633 --> 06:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 120,000 people in
Alameda County were added to
the rolls with the passage of

06:39.600 --> 06:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

06:41.666 --> 06:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The uncertainty over health
care in Washington is causing
worry here in South Hayward.

06:46.200 --> 06:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuts to Medicaid could reduce
a key funding stream for this
clinic, keeping it from being

06:51.133 --> 06:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
self-sustaining in
the coming years.

06:53.766 --> 06:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a concern for
providers and patients alike.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA GREIVES: I wouldn't
be covered by the new bill.

07:00.433 --> 07:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's all there is to it, and
it's just like, holy dirty word.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's an uncertainty,
and it's scary.

07:09.833 --> 07:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID B. VLIET: Ultimately, it
means that more folks cannot
be seen in a health center

07:16.366 --> 07:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like this, and would
not have a paying source
in order to do that.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The
partnership of firefighters
and health care workers
is a first for California.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: The attempt to
bridge the 911 system and the
primary care system, I think

07:29.200 --> 07:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's a unique experiment.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS: I do
believe it can be a model.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do believe it will
be -- can be repeated.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not easy.

07:38.033 --> 07:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not so easy to do to get
multiple governmental
agencies to work together,
drop the boundaries,

07:43.533 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drop the egos, drop the who said
what, who's doing what, who's
getting credit for anything,

07:49.866 --> 07:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and just do it because
it's the right thing
to do and it'll improve
service to the community.

07:52.100 --> 07:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: I'm Kathleen
McCleery for the "PBS NewsHour"
in Hayward, California.
