FORWARD.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MORE MEANS TO USE FOR ITS TERROR

03:17.000 --> 03:18.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:09.800 --> 04:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER TODAY, NOT UNRELATED TO

04:13.133 --> 04:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TIMING OF YESTERDAY, THE

04:14.767 --> 04:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. TREASURY IMPOSED NEW

04:16.600 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS ON 11 IRANIAN

04:19.433 --> 04:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE, PEOPLE

04:21.800 --> 04:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN, AND

04:24.000 --> 04:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REASON FOR THOSE NEW

04:25.400 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS IS BECAUSE OF IRAN'S

04:26.967 --> 04:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE 2010 THE U.N. SECURITY

04:31.600 --> 04:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNCIL HAS REQUIRED THAT IRAN

04:32.800 --> 04:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT DEVELOP OR TEST BALLISTIC

04:35.400 --> 04:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSILES THAT COULD BE USED TO

04:37.567 --> 04:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUNCH NEW CLEAR WEAPONS, BUT OF

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, THOSE TESTS HAVE

04:40.400 --> 04:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUED AS RECENTLY AS LAST

04:41.433 --> 04:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTH.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO TO CLARIFY,

04:44.400 --> 04:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED

04:45.767 --> 04:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES, WHAT HAPPENS?

04:46.967 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISN'T LIKE OPENING OR

04:50.000 --> 04:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMALIZING OF RELATIONS WITH

04:51.200 --> 04:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBA.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA USED

04:53.933 --> 04:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ANALOGY WHEN HE SPOKE TODAY

04:55.633 --> 04:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE CABINET ROOM OF THE WHITE

04:57.467 --> 04:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSE, IN IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

04:58.900 --> 05:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBA BECAUSE WHILE THE U.S. DOES

05:00.200 --> 05:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW HAVE OFFICIAL DIPLOMATIC

05:02.300 --> 05:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONS WITH CUBA, IT DOES NOT

05:03.633 --> 05:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR IRAN.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR U.S. BUSINESSES THERE IS

05:06.900 --> 05:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL A LOT OF CAUTION AND

05:08.333 --> 05:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIMITATIONS.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY THE ONE SECTOR THAT

05:10.600 --> 05:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS MOST FOR THE U.S. IS

05:12.800 --> 05:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVIATION BECAUSE THE NEW CLEAR

05:14.000 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL THAT WAS REACHED LAST

05:16.300 --> 05:18.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUMMER INCLUDED A CARVE OUT FOR

05:18.067 --> 05:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIRPLANE PRODUCTION AND AIRPLANE

05:19.767 --> 05:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEASING AND PARTS TO SERVICE

05:20.767 --> 05:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INDUSTRY.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT OTHER INDUSTRIES,

05:23.167 --> 05:24.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL SERVICES

05:24.067 --> 05:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE STILL EXTREMELY LIMITED AND

05:26.367 --> 05:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE REASON TO BE VERY, VERY

05:28.100 --> 05:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUTIOUS WHEN THEY PROCEED WITH

05:29.600 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN BECAUSE OF THE SANCTIONS

05:31.533 --> 05:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCH AS WE SAW FROM THIS

05:32.567 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORNING, THAT ARE STILL IN

05:33.700 --> 05:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

05:35.967 --> 05:37.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPTICS OF IT?

05:37.467 --> 05:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE IRAN SAYS THEY ARE

05:40.000 --> 05:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BUY A BUNCH OF PLANES,

05:41.867 --> 05:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT FROM AIRBUS, IS BOEING AT A

05:44.033 --> 05:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISADVANTAGE THAT THEY COULDN'T

05:44.933 --> 05:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SELL NEARLY AS FAST BUT AT THE

05:46.800 --> 05:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME TIME WE HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL

05:48.333 --> 05:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACE THAT IS HAPPENING.

05:49.333 --> 05:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

05:49.967 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A LOT OF QUESTION

05:50.933 --> 05:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKS.

05:51.733 --> 05:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIRBUS DID ANNOUNCE-- ANNOUNCE

05:54.000 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR DEAL WITH TEHRAN YESTERDAY

05:55.633 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BOEING STILL HAS TO GO

05:57.833 --> 05:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH SOME HOOPS TO BE ABLE TO

05:59.367 --> 06:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LICENSE TO SELL TO IRAN.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF

06:02.033 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOWING.

06:03.233 --> 06:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN HAS GREAT PLANE DEMAND.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AVERAGE AGE OF THEIR PLANES

06:06.300 --> 06:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS 27 YEARS OLD FOR IRAN AIR.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR

06:10.400 --> 06:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVIATION.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE ARE RISKS IN PART

06:13.767 --> 06:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF OBJECTS.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN IS INDEED NOT A FRIEND OF

06:16.933 --> 06:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. AND THE OBAMA

06:18.800 --> 06:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION MADE CLEAR THERE

06:20.467 --> 06:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HUMAN

06:22.000 --> 06:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS, RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL

06:22.767 --> 06:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER ALLIES OF THE U.S. IN

06:25.133 --> 06:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND COMPANIES THAT WANT TO DO

06:27.100 --> 06:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS WITH IRAN DO HAVE THAT

06:28.700 --> 06:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW GOOD DOES IT LOOK TO BE

06:31.567 --> 06:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COZYING UP WITH IRAN AND THEN

06:33.467 --> 06:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A QUESTION MARK OF WHAT

06:34.967 --> 06:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS IF A REPUBLICAN IS

06:36.600 --> 06:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED TO SUCCEED OBAMA, WILL

06:38.467 --> 06:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEAL STILL BE IN PLACE?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL THE AGREEMENT STAND.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON THE LEADING

06:44.567 --> 06:46.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, OF COURSE,

06:46.067 --> 06:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY

06:47.100 --> 06:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF STATE.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF SHE IS TO WIN THE

06:49.200 --> 06:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THERE IS

06:50.467 --> 06:51.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE AGREEMENT

06:51.667 --> 06:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD STAY IN PLACE BECAUSE SHE

06:53.200 --> 06:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELPED NEGOTIATE THE EARLY

06:54.500 --> 06:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAGES OF IT.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IRAN ALSO SAYS

06:56.600 --> 06:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO START

06:59.233 --> 07:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCTION AND I GUESS, SELLING

07:01.767 --> 07:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
500,000 BARRELS OF OIL.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW THE U.S. HAS VERY,

07:05.333 --> 07:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY LOW OIL PRICES.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT MEAN THE BASIC

07:08.200 --> 07:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMICS, THEY INCREASE SUPPLY,

07:10.000 --> 07:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECREASE DEMAND, DOES THAT MEAN

07:11.867 --> 07:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE PRICES FALL FURTHER OR

07:13.200 --> 07:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT A REAL DROP IN THE BUCKET

07:14.900 --> 07:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU THINK OF GLOBAL OIL?

07:17.133 --> 07:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, IRAN IS A MAJOR OIL

07:18.567 --> 07:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCER.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY USED TO BE THE SECOND

07:21.267 --> 07:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGEST PRODUCER IN OPEC SO THE

07:23.233 --> 07:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN

07:24.567 --> 07:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCTION ON THE WORLD OIL

07:26.200 --> 07:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKETS COULD BE LARGE.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR IRAN, WHILE IT'S A GREAT

07:29.767 --> 07:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO EARN

07:31.300 --> 07:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE MONEY AND PRODUCE MORE, IT

07:33.467 --> 07:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY COULDN'T COME AT A WORSE

07:36.100 --> 07:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORLDWIDE PRICE OF A BARREL

07:38.467 --> 07:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF OIL FELL BELOW $30 AT THE

07:40.667 --> 07:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE ON FRIDAY.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS AGO WE

07:44.000 --> 07:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE LOOKING AT $100 BARRELS OF

07:45.867 --> 07:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OIL TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF IRAN IS TO INCREASE

07:49.567 --> 07:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCTION AND THEREFORE

07:50.467 --> 07:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASE SUPPLY WORLDWIDE, BASIC

07:52.500 --> 07:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMICS TELLS YOU THAT THAT

07:54.700 --> 07:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL SERVE LIKELY TO DEPRESS

07:56.067 --> 07:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
