WHICH ENDED THIS SIEGE.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.500
MICHEL CATALANO, THE OWNER OF

02:13.500 --> 02:15.135
THE BUSINESS WHO LET THE GUNMEN

02:15.135 --> 02:17.270
IN, AND HIS ACCOUNT WAS NOT WHAT

02:17.270 --> 02:18.772
YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.607
HE SAID THE BROTHERS WERE ALWAYS

02:20.607 --> 02:22.943
POLITE AND NEVER AGGRESSIVE,

02:22.943 --> 02:24.244
THAT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEY

02:24.244 --> 02:25.946
WOULD NOT HURT HIM, THAT HE

02:25.946 --> 02:27.948
OFFERED TO MAKE THEM A CUP OF

02:27.948 --> 02:30.183
COFFEE, AND THAT THEY TOLD HIM

02:30.183 --> 02:32.285
TO CALL IN THE POLICE.

STILL UNDER POLICE GUARD, MR.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.256
CATALANO APPEARED BRIEFLY

02:36.256 --> 02:37.924
OUTSIDE HIS HOME.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.760
THE BROTHERS LET HIM GO BEFORE

02:39.760 --> 02:41.762
THE BATTLE STARTED, BUT HE WAS

02:41.762 --> 02:43.130
STILL STRUGGLING WITH THE

02:43.130 --> 02:46.233
ENORMITY OF HOSTING FRANCE'S

02:46.233 --> 02:48.035
MOST DANGEROUS MEN.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.209
EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY, AND I

02:56.209 --> 02:57.711
THOUGHT I WAS IN A FILM.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.945
>> Reporter: IT'S NOW BELIEVED

02:58.945 --> 03:00.914

03:00.914 --> 03:03.250
KOUACHI HAD TRAVELED TO YEMEN.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.718
AND BEFORE THEY WERE KILLED, ONE

03:04.718 --> 03:06.586
OF THEM TOLD FRENCH TELEVISION

03:06.586 --> 03:07.988
THAT HE WAS PART OF AL QAEDA

03:07.988 --> 03:09.523
THERE.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.668
SO, THE JOURNEY FROM THESE

03:21.668 --> 03:23.804
FIGHTERS IN THE YEMENI MOUNTAINS

03:23.804 --> 03:25.739
TO A SMALL COMMUTER TOWN NEAR

03:25.739 --> 03:27.874

07:51.738 --> 07:53.239
BEEN EXPECTED TO DECIDE BY THE

07:53.239 --> 07:56.042
END OF 2014 WHETHER TO TRY AND

07:56.042 --> 07:57.444
SEEK AN INDICTMENT.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.446
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN, WHO, IN 2013,

07:59.446 --> 08:00.580
WAS ACQUITTED IN THE SHOOTING

08:00.580 --> 08:02.148
DEATH OF TRAYVON MARTIN, IS IN

08:02.148 --> 08:03.717
TROUBLE WITH THE LAW AGAIN.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.285
HE WAS ARRESTED LAST NIGHT FOR

08:05.285 --> 08:07.087
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT IN CONNECTION

08:07.087 --> 08:08.355
WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

08:08.355 --> 08:09.022
INCIDENT.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.690
DURING A COURT APPEARANCE THIS

08:10.690 --> 08:12.726
MORNING, BOND WAS SET AT $5,000.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
ZIMMERMAN WAS ALSO ORDERED TO

08:14.127 --> 08:15.695
STAY AWAY FROM THE WOMAN

08:15.695 --> 08:16.496
INVOLVED.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.964
HE REPORTEDLY WAS INVOLVED IN

08:17.964 --> 08:20.633
TWO SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN 2013,

08:20.633 --> 08:22.369
BUT NO FORMAL CHARGES WERE EVER

08:22.369 --> 08:23.336
BROUGHT.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.304
A JUDGE IN SANTA BARBARA,

08:24.304 --> 08:25.705
CALIFORNIA, HAS ADMITTED INTO

08:25.705 --> 08:27.440
EVIDENCE INTERNAL FILES FROM THE

08:27.440 --> 08:29.042
BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA

08:29.042 --> 08:30.543
DOCUMENTING SEXUAL ABUSE

08:30.543 --> 08:31.678
ALLEGATIONS WITHIN THE

08:31.678 --> 08:33.413
ORGANIZATION, WHICH MEANS THEY

08:33.413 --> 08:34.814
COULD BECOME PUBLIC.

08:34.814 --> 08:36.316
THE JUDGE IS PRESIDING OVER A

08:36.316 --> 08:37.884
LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY A MAN WHO

08:37.884 --> 08:40.453
ALLEGES HE WAS MOLESTED SEXUALLY

08:40.453 --> 08:42.555
WHEN HE WAS A 13-YEAR-OLD SCOUT.

08:42.555 --> 08:43.723
INTERNAL BOY SCOUT FILES

08:43.723 --> 08:45.592
PREVIOUSLY MADE PUBLIC SHOWED

08:45.592 --> 08:46.659
THAT THE ORGANIZATION FAILED TO

08:46.659 --> 08:48.728
REPORT A THIRD OF ALL ABUSE

08:48.728 --> 08:50.930
ALLEGATIONS TO POLICE.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.766
THE PROPOSED TAKEOVER OF FAMILY

08:52.766 --> 08:54.100
DOLLAR STORES BY RIVAL

08:54.100 --> 08:55.602
DISCOUNTERS IS RUNNING INTO

08:55.602 --> 08:56.603
OPPOSITION.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.705
ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 20 STATES

08:58.705 --> 09:00.540
HAVE JOINED A FEDERAL ANTITRUST

09:00.540 --> 09:02.642
INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE

09:02.642 --> 09:04.511
BUYOUT OF FAMILY DOLLAR BY

09:04.511 --> 09:07.781
DOLLAR GENERAL AND DOLLAR TREE.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.648
THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE

09:08.648 --> 09:09.682
EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THE

09:09.682 --> 09:11.317
PROPOSED DEAL COULD RESULT IN

09:11.317 --> 09:13.386
HIGHER PRICES FOR SHOPPERS, MANY

09:13.386 --> 09:15.155
OF WHOM ARE POOR.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.389
THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS

09:16.389 --> 09:18.158
WORKING AS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES

09:18.158 --> 09:20.260
IS NOW AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE

09:20.260 --> 09:22.195
1960, BACK WHEN DWIGHT

09:22.195 --> 09:23.863
EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT.

09:23.863 --> 09:24.898
THIS ACCORDING TO THE MOST

09:24.898 --> 09:26.633
RECENT JOBS REPORT RELEASED

09:26.633 --> 09:27.434
YESTERDAY.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.635
EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF

09:28.635 --> 09:30.236
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES IS UP OVER

09:30.236 --> 09:31.704
THE YEARS, GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

09:31.704 --> 09:33.373
AS A PERCENTAGE OF ALL WORKERS

09:33.373 --> 09:35.475
PEAKED IN THE MID-1970s.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.110
BACK THEN, IT WAS JUST SHORT OF

09:37.110 --> 09:41.181
20%; IT'S NOW 15.6%.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.749
TURNING OVERSEAS NOW, PROGRESS

09:42.749 --> 09:44.284
IS REPORTED IN THE INVESTIGATION

09:44.284 --> 09:46.286
INTO THE CRASH OF THAT AIRASIA

09:46.286 --> 09:48.288
JETLINER THAT WENT DOWN WITH 162

09:48.288 --> 09:49.656
ON BOARD TWO WEEKS AGO.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.257
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS RAISED

09:51.257 --> 09:52.759
THE TAIL OF THE AIRBUS FROM THE

09:52.759 --> 09:54.327
FLOOR OF THE JAVA SEA.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.995
IT HAD BEEN IN WATERS ABOUT 100

09:55.995 --> 09:56.863
FEET DEEP.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.198
HOWEVER, THE SO-CALLED "BLACK

09:58.198 --> 09:59.833
BOXES," THE PLANE'S FLIGHT DATA

09:59.833 --> 10:01.968
RECORDERS, STILL HAVE NOT BEEN

10:01.968 --> 10:02.902
RECOVERED.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.537
PINGS FROM THEM WERE DETECTED IN

10:04.537 --> 10:05.738
THE VICINITY OF THE TAIL

10:05.738 --> 10:07.040
YESTERDAY.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.308
NORTH KOREA OFFERED TODAY TO

10:08.308 --> 10:09.776
TEMPORARILY SUSPEND NUCLEAR

10:09.776 --> 10:11.444
TESTING IF THE U.S. AND SOUTH

10:11.444 --> 10:13.513
KOREA AGREE TO SCRAP JOINT

10:13.513 --> 10:15.515
MILITARY EXERCISES LATER THIS

10:15.515 --> 10:16.149
YEAR.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.384
NORTH KOREA HAS CONDUCTED THREE

10:18.384 --> 10:19.819
NUCLEAR TESTS IN THE PAST

10:19.819 --> 10:22.822
DECADE, THE LATEST IN 2013.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.324
THE U.S. RESPONDED, SAYING

10:24.324 --> 10:26.292
LINKING ITS MILITARY DRILLS TO A

10:26.292 --> 10:28.661
POSSIBLE NUCLEAR TEST WAS "AN

10:28.661 --> 10:30.697
IMPLICIT THREAT" BUT SAID IT IS

10:30.697 --> 10:32.665
OPEN TO A DIALOGUE WITH NORTH

10:32.665 --> 10:33.600
KOREA.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.101
AND SPACE X, THE PRIVATE SPACE

10:35.101 --> 10:36.669
EXPLORATION COMPANY FOUNDED BY

10:36.669 --> 10:37.904
BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK,

10:37.904 --> 10:39.539
SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED ANOTHER

10:39.539 --> 10:41.274
UNMANNED "FALCON 9" ROCKET FROM

10:41.274 --> 10:42.442
CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA, THIS

10:42.442 --> 10:43.142
MORNING.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.044
A CAPSULE WILL DELIVER SUPPLIES

10:45.044 --> 10:46.412
TO SIX ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE

10:46.412 --> 10:47.914
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.115
BUT THE FIRM'S REVOLUTIONARY

10:49.115 --> 10:51.150
ATTEMPT TO LAND A BOOSTER ROCKET

10:51.150 --> 10:53.052
ON AN OCEAN BARGE OFF FLORIDA

10:53.052 --> 10:54.420
CAME UP JUST SHORT.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.822
IT ACTUALLY HIT THE TARGET, BUT

10:55.822 --> 10:57.790
TOO HARD AND BROKE APART.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.192
A TWEET FROM ELON MUSK AFTER THE

10:59.192 --> 11:01.127
FAILED LANDING READ, "CLOSE, BUT

11:01.127 --> 11:03.162
NO CIGAR THIS TIME."

11:13.239 --> 11:14.507
>> Sreenivasan: WE WANT TO GO

11:14.507 --> 11:15.808
MUCH MORE DEEPLY NOW INTO THE

11:15.808 --> 11:16.976
EXTENT OF THE TERROR THREAT

11:16.976 --> 11:18.711
OVERSEAS AND EXAMINE WHAT

11:18.711 --> 11:20.346
DANGERS IT POSES HERE IN THE

11:20.346 --> 11:21.481
UNITED STATES.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.382
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE ARE

11:22.382 --> 11:23.449
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

11:23.449 --> 11:24.183
JOHN McLAUGHLIN.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.652
HE WAS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF

11:25.652 --> 11:27.153
THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

11:27.153 --> 11:28.488
FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.557
SO, AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE

11:30.557 --> 11:32.492
ABOUT HOW THIS ATTACK UNFOLDED,

11:32.492 --> 11:33.593
THE KIND OF TRAINING THESE

11:33.593 --> 11:35.395
INDIVIDUALS HAD, WHAT SHOULD THE

11:35.395 --> 11:39.465
U.S. BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

11:39.465 --> 11:40.867
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

11:40.867 --> 11:42.735
HERE THAT SHOULD CONCERN US IS

11:42.735 --> 11:45.038
THAT THERE ARE A LARGER NUMBER

11:45.038 --> 11:47.073
OF PEOPLE IN THE EXTREMIST

11:47.073 --> 11:49.375
MOVEMENT NOW WITH WESTERN

11:49.375 --> 11:52.145
PASSPORTS THAN AT ANY TIME IN

11:52.145 --> 11:53.613
HISTORY.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.515
LOOK AT JUST EUROPE ALONE--

11:55.515 --> 11:57.317
THERE ARE MORE THAN 1,200

11:57.317 --> 11:58.851
FRENCHMEN THERE, SOMETHING LIKE

11:58.851 --> 12:02.755
500 GERMANS, 300 OR 400 FROM THE

12:02.755 --> 12:05.158
U.K., AND THAT'S THE TIP OF THE

12:05.158 --> 12:06.459
ICEBERG.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.527
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

12:07.527 --> 12:11.497
AMERICANS-- PERHAPS 100 TO 200

12:11.497 --> 12:12.966
AMERICANS ARE THE FIGURES I'VE

12:12.966 --> 12:15.435
SEEN-- SOMEHOW INVOLVED WITH THE

12:15.435 --> 12:18.304
JIHAD IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.341
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE IS

12:21.341 --> 12:23.109
AN UNPRECEDENTED POTENTIAL FOR

12:23.109 --> 12:24.677
MOVEMENT TOWARD THE UNITED

12:24.677 --> 12:25.878
STATES AND, OF COURSE, INTO

12:25.878 --> 12:28.448
EUROPE AS WELL BY PASSPORT

12:28.448 --> 12:30.450
HOLDERS WHO CAN MOVE FREELY

12:30.450 --> 12:32.285
AMONG THE 27 COUNTRIES OF THE

12:32.285 --> 12:34.921
EUROPEAN UNION, AND, AS EUROPEAN

12:34.921 --> 12:37.357
UNION MEMBERS, IN MOST CASES BE

12:37.357 --> 12:38.291
ABLE TO COME TO THE UNITED

12:38.291 --> 12:39.959
STATES WITHOUT A VISA.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.362
SO, THAT IMPOSES ON THE UNITED

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
STATES AND OUR INTELLIGENCE

12:43.997 --> 12:45.498
SERVICES, OUR BORDER CONTROLS

12:45.498 --> 12:47.734
AND SO FORTH, A VERY HIGH

12:47.734 --> 12:50.370
STANDARD FOR DETECTING MOVEMENT

12:50.370 --> 12:52.372
INTO AND OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.606
>> Sreenivasan: ISN'T THERE...

12:53.606 --> 12:54.807
>> I'M SORRY.

12:54.807 --> 12:55.375
GO AHEAD.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.275
>> Sreenivasan: WOULDN'T THE

12:56.275 --> 12:57.810
UNITED STATES KNOW WHO SOME OF

12:57.810 --> 12:59.012
THESE PEOPLE ARE AND BE ABLE TO

12:59.012 --> 13:00.380
SORT OF CROSS-CHECK AGAINST A

13:00.380 --> 13:01.948
COUPLE OF LISTS SAYING, OKAY,

13:01.948 --> 13:03.316
THIS IS A GERMAN PASSPORT HOLDER

13:03.316 --> 13:04.751
BUT HE'S BEEN IN AN AREA IN

13:04.751 --> 13:07.286
YEMEN THAT IS KNOWN TO HAVE

13:07.286 --> 13:09.822
TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS?

13:09.822 --> 13:10.890
>> YES, WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT

13:10.890 --> 13:12.058
THAT.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.926
THE THING I WOULD SAY, THOUGH,

13:13.926 --> 13:15.128
IS THAT WE ARE DEALING HERE WITH

13:15.128 --> 13:16.529
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.464
NOW, THAT SAID, I THINK WE HAVE

13:18.464 --> 13:20.667
PROBABLY THE BEST... WHAT'S

13:20.667 --> 13:22.769
CALLED A WATCH LISTING SYSTEM IN

13:22.769 --> 13:23.569
THE WORLD.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.606
THAT IS TO SAY, WHO IS NOT

13:26.606 --> 13:28.941
AUTHORIZED TO GET ON AIRPLANES,

13:28.941 --> 13:30.943
WHO SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT

13:30.943 --> 13:32.845
IF NOT TO PREVENT THEM FROM

13:32.845 --> 13:34.380
GETTING ON PLANES, TO PULL THEM

13:34.380 --> 13:35.548
OUT OF LINE IF WE KNOW THEY'RE

13:35.548 --> 13:37.550
THERE AND DO SOME SECONDARY

13:37.550 --> 13:38.818
QUESTIONING FOR THEM.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.887
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THAT

13:40.887 --> 13:42.355
SINCE 9/11 THAT WE HAVE A VERY

13:42.355 --> 13:43.990
FINELY-TUNED SYSTEM FOR THAT.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.392
AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED NOW, A

13:46.392 --> 13:47.794
COUPLE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN

13:47.794 --> 13:49.796
FRANCE WERE ON OUR NO-FLY LIST.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.198
SO, HAD THEY GOTTEN ON AN

13:52.198 --> 13:53.733
AIRPLANE AND COME TO THE UNITED

13:53.733 --> 13:56.669
STATES, IN MANY CASES NOW, WE

13:56.669 --> 13:58.137
HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH AIRPORTS

13:58.137 --> 13:59.672
OVERSEAS TO HAVE THE MANIFESTS

13:59.672 --> 14:02.108
OF PLANES TRAVELING HERE.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.176
SOMEONE WOULD HAVE PICKED THEM

14:03.176 --> 14:05.178
OUT FROM THOSE MANIFESTS AS

14:05.178 --> 14:07.513
PEOPLE THAT WE NEEDED TO CATCH

14:07.513 --> 14:08.848
AT THE AIRPORT FOR FURTHER

14:08.848 --> 14:09.582
QUESTIONING.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.984
SO, WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THAT,

14:11.984 --> 14:14.821
BUT THE CAVEAT I WOULD SAY IS,

14:14.821 --> 14:16.289
WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT AN

14:16.289 --> 14:19.392
ENORMOUS VOLUME OF PEOPLE IN A

14:19.392 --> 14:22.762
FIELD OF INTELLIGENCE... RATHER,

14:22.762 --> 14:25.098
COUNTERTERRORISM, THAT IS, IN

14:25.098 --> 14:26.799
MY EXPERIENCE, THE MOST LABOR

14:26.799 --> 14:29.135
INTENSIVE PART OF INTELLIGENCE.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.536
IT'S NOT LIKE ESTIMATING A

14:30.536 --> 14:32.205
LARGE CONVENTIONAL MILITARY

14:32.205 --> 14:33.072
FORCE.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.874
THE BIG CHANGE HERE THAT I WOULD

14:34.874 --> 14:37.176
SAY SINCE, SAY, THE COLD WAR IS,

14:37.176 --> 14:38.444
BACK THEN WE HAD TO LOOK FOR

14:38.444 --> 14:40.913
VERY BIG THINGS IN THE WORLD--

14:40.913 --> 14:43.483
BOMBERS, SUBMARINES, WHOLE ARMY

14:43.483 --> 14:44.350
GROUPS.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.852
NOW, WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR VERY

14:45.852 --> 14:48.154
SMALL THINGS-- A SINGLE PERSON,

14:48.154 --> 14:50.356
A BOMB IN A SUITCASE, LIQUID

14:50.356 --> 14:52.658
ON A PLANE.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.327
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE MUCH HIGHER

14:54.327 --> 14:55.728
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SOMEONE

14:55.728 --> 14:58.097
SLIPPING THROUGH IS VERY HIGH.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.198
AND WE'VE HAD SOME INCIDENTS OF

14:59.198 --> 15:00.900
THIS IN OUR COUNTRY, THE

15:00.900 --> 15:03.069
ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF NEW YORK...

15:03.069 --> 15:04.804
TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK AND SO

15:04.804 --> 15:05.438
FORTH.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.472
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT SORTS

15:06.472 --> 15:07.306
OF RESOURCES ARE WE TALKING

15:07.306 --> 15:08.341
ABOUT?

15:08.341 --> 15:09.809
IS THE UNITED STATES EQUIPPED TO

15:09.809 --> 15:11.677
TRY TO MAKE THAT NET AS TIGHT AS

15:11.677 --> 15:13.412
POSSIBLE?

15:13.412 --> 15:16.582
>> WELL, WE ARE, BUT, AGAIN, I

15:16.582 --> 15:18.785
HAVE TO SAY I EXPECT SOMEONE

15:18.785 --> 15:20.853
TO GET THROUGH HERE.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.021
I THINK WE'RE NOW IN AN ERA

15:22.021 --> 15:23.556
WHERE THE NEW NORMAL IS THIS

15:23.556 --> 15:26.626
KIND OF ATTACK, AND MOST

15:26.626 --> 15:28.060
INTELLIGENCE SPECIALISTS WILL

15:28.060 --> 15:29.762
TELL YOU TO EXPECT SOMETHING

15:29.762 --> 15:30.930
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE

15:30.930 --> 15:32.832
UNITED STATES AT SOME POINT.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.200
BUT WHAT DO WE DO TO STOP THAT,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.701
TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCES?

15:35.701 --> 15:38.204
WELL, THE FIRST REQUIREMENT I

15:38.204 --> 15:40.306
THINK OUT OF THE EVENTS IN PARIS

15:40.306 --> 15:42.742
IS FOR MUCH CLOSER... WE ALREADY

15:42.742 --> 15:44.110
HAVE CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH

15:44.110 --> 15:46.279
THESE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, BUT

15:46.279 --> 15:48.414
FOR MUCH CLOSER AND TIGHTER

15:48.414 --> 15:49.682
SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

15:49.682 --> 15:51.818
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ABOUT

15:51.818 --> 15:52.485
EVERYTHING.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.319
>> Sreenivasan: ISN'T THAT

15:53.319 --> 15:54.620
ALREADY HAPPENING?

15:54.620 --> 15:55.955
>> YES, IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.090
BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK AT

15:58.090 --> 15:59.559
IT IN THE AFTERMATH OF SOMETHING

15:59.559 --> 16:00.326
LIKE THIS.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.794
I DID A STUDY FOR THE DIRECTOR

16:01.794 --> 16:03.162
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AFTER

16:03.162 --> 16:04.697
THE FAILED CHRISTMAS BOMBER IN

16:04.697 --> 16:08.267
2009 AND 2010, AND, OF COURSE,

16:08.267 --> 16:10.570
BY THEN, OUR CONSULTATION WITH

16:10.570 --> 16:12.438
OTHER SERVICES WAS DRAMATICALLY

16:12.438 --> 16:13.606
BETTER THAN IT WAS AT THE TIME

16:13.606 --> 16:15.441
OF 9/11, BUT THERE WERE STILL

16:15.441 --> 16:16.375
SOME BARRIERS THAT WE

16:16.375 --> 16:18.144
RECOMMENDED BE REMOVED.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.545
I SUSPECT THERE ARE STILL SOME

16:19.545 --> 16:21.714
SEAMS, WHAT I CALL THEM AS

16:21.714 --> 16:22.548
SEAMS.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.517
THAT IS WHERE ONE SET OF

16:24.517 --> 16:25.818
AUTHORITIES BUMPS UP AGAINST

16:25.818 --> 16:27.220
ANOTHER SET OF AUTHORITIES.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.688
THE SIMPLEST EXAMPLE IS IN THE

16:28.688 --> 16:30.156
UNITED STATES, WHERE THE C.I.A.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.591
IS NOT PERMITTED TO OPERATE

16:31.591 --> 16:32.892
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

16:32.892 --> 16:33.626
LEGALLY.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.794
THE F.B.I. IS.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.629
THAT'S A SEAM, SO WE'VE WORKED

16:36.629 --> 16:38.130
VERY HARD TO BUILD BRIDGES

16:38.130 --> 16:39.665
ACROSS THAT SEAM QUITE

16:39.665 --> 16:41.234
SUCCESSFULLY.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.869
SO, YOU HAVE EQUIVALENT SEAMS

16:42.869 --> 16:44.370
THAT EXIST AMONG FOREIGN

16:44.370 --> 16:45.504
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.706
SAY AN INTELLIGENCE

16:46.706 --> 16:47.740
SERVICE IN EUROPE GETS

16:47.740 --> 16:49.609
INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER SERVICE

16:49.609 --> 16:52.278
IN EUROPE, CAN THAT SERVICE THEN

16:52.278 --> 16:54.380
GIVE THAT INFORMATION FROM A

16:54.380 --> 16:56.916
SECOND SERVICE TO US?

16:56.916 --> 16:59.318
OR DO THEY FIRST HAVE TO GO BACK

16:59.318 --> 17:00.586
AND ASK THE SERVICE FROM WHICH

17:00.586 --> 17:01.454
THEY GOT IT?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.722
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF SEAMS THAT

17:02.722 --> 17:04.724
WE OUGHT TO ATTACK NOW.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.392
WE'RE VERY GOOD AT THIS, BUT I

17:06.392 --> 17:08.127
THINK IN THE AFTERMATH OF

17:08.127 --> 17:09.595
SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU ALWAYS

17:09.595 --> 17:11.631
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND SAY WHAT

17:11.631 --> 17:12.665
HAPPENED HERE THAT WE CAN

17:12.665 --> 17:13.232
IMPROVE?

17:13.232 --> 17:14.233
AND I'M SURE WE ARE GOING TO DO

17:14.233 --> 17:14.967
THAT.

17:14.967 --> 17:15.902
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, SO

17:15.902 --> 17:17.403
THE HEAD OF THE MI5 RECENTLY

17:17.403 --> 17:19.138
SAID THAT HE'S CONCERNED WITH

17:19.138 --> 17:20.506
THE INCREASING LEVEL OF THREAT

17:20.506 --> 17:22.475
AND THE DECREASING AMOUNT OF

17:22.475 --> 17:23.976
CAPABILITY OR CAPACITY HE HAS

17:23.976 --> 17:26.145
TO DEAL WITH THOSE THREATS.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.179
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR

17:27.179 --> 17:28.447
IN THE U.S., AS WELL.

17:28.447 --> 17:30.549
BUT THAT SORT OF "INTEL SPEAK,"

17:30.549 --> 17:32.184
BREAK THAT DOWN FOR A U.S.

17:32.184 --> 17:32.985
AUDIENCE MEMBER.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.854
HOW IS IT THAT THEY SEE THESE

17:34.854 --> 17:35.888
THREATS AND THEY CAN'T SEEM TO

17:35.888 --> 17:38.090
FIGHT THEM OR KEEP UP?

17:38.090 --> 17:39.392
>> IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER OF

17:39.392 --> 17:40.760
VOLUME.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.929
THE VOLUME OF THREAT HAS GONE UP

17:42.929 --> 17:45.798
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FOUR

17:45.798 --> 17:48.234
YEARS, FIVE YEARS, IN PART FOR A

17:48.234 --> 17:49.435
WHOLE VARIETY OF COMPLEX

17:49.435 --> 17:50.136
REASONS.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.737
TERRORISTS NOW HAVE THE LARGEST

17:51.737 --> 17:53.272
SAFE HAVEN THAT THEY'VE HAD IN

17:53.272 --> 17:54.840
OVER A DECADE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

17:54.840 --> 17:57.209
THE AREA IN THE... ESSENTIALLY

17:57.209 --> 17:59.045
THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA

17:59.045 --> 18:00.813
AND THE LARGE UNGOVERNED SPACES.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.115
SO, MANY THINGS ARE BEHIND IT,

18:03.115 --> 18:04.450
BUT THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE

18:04.450 --> 18:05.851
PARTICIPATING IN JIHADIST

18:05.851 --> 18:07.820
OPERATIONS IS MUCH GREATER.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.388
SO, IN ORDER TO SURVEIL

18:09.388 --> 18:10.890
SOMEONE-- AND MANY COMMENTATORS

18:10.890 --> 18:12.124
HAVE MADE THIS POINT IN RECENT

18:12.124 --> 18:15.728
DAYS-- IT TAKES ANYWHERE BETWEEN

18:15.728 --> 18:17.930
A DOZEN AND 30 PEOPLE TO DO

18:17.930 --> 18:19.699
24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE ON AN

18:19.699 --> 18:21.100
INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THEY DON'T

18:21.100 --> 18:22.835
DETECT SOMEONE SURVEILLING THEM.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.437
SO, IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER OF

18:24.437 --> 18:27.974
VOLUME, AND YOU HAVE SO MANY...

18:27.974 --> 18:29.241
ONLY SO MANY INTELLIGENCE

18:29.241 --> 18:32.611
OFFICERS.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.146
I WOULD SAY WHEN YOU COMPARE THE

18:34.146 --> 18:35.848
NUMBERS OF INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS

18:35.848 --> 18:37.883
TO THE NUMBERS OF JIHADISTS FOR

18:37.883 --> 18:41.020
A COUNTRY LIKE BRITAIN, THEY ARE

18:41.020 --> 18:41.821
FAR OUT NUMBERED.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.788
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.290
>> I MEAN, THEY HAVE MAYBE 500

18:44.290 --> 18:45.558
CASES THAT THEY ARE WORKING AT

18:45.558 --> 18:48.627
ANY GIVEN TIME AT A VERY FINE

18:48.627 --> 18:49.729
LEVEL OF DETAIL.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.563
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, JOHN

18:50.563 --> 18:51.731
McLAUGHLIN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF

18:51.731 --> 18:53.399
THE C.I.A., THANKS FOR JOINING

18:53.399 --> 18:54.066
US.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.835
>> YOU BET.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.246
>> Sreenivasan: WE WANT TO

19:07.246 --> 19:08.280
RETURN NOW TO PARIS TO GET A

19:08.280 --> 19:09.448
BETTER SENSE OF THE MOOD THERE

19:09.448 --> 19:10.983
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS WEEK'S

19:10.983 --> 19:11.751
TERROR ATTACKS.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.785
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE ARE

19:12.785 --> 19:14.053
JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE BY RACHEL

19:14.053 --> 19:16.055
DONADIO OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

19:16.055 --> 19:18.357
SO, WHAT IS THE MOOD THERE ON

19:18.357 --> 19:20.793
THE STREETS OF PARIS?

19:20.793 --> 19:21.927
>> WELL, I WILL SAY IT'S PRETTY

19:21.927 --> 19:23.562
QUIET.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.830
I WALKED THIS MORNING THROUGH

19:24.830 --> 19:27.800
THE MARAIS, AN AREA THAT HAS A

19:27.800 --> 19:29.435
LARGE JEWISH POPULATION BUT ALSO

19:29.435 --> 19:30.803
A LOT OF SHOPS THAT ARE NORMALLY

19:30.803 --> 19:32.972
EXTREMELY CROWDED ON WEEKENDS,

19:32.972 --> 19:34.607
AND IT WAS VERY EMPTY.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.541
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT EERIE,

19:35.541 --> 19:36.175
FRANKLY.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.043
THERE WERE PEOPLE SITTING IN

19:37.043 --> 19:38.844
CAFES READING THE NEWSPAPER,

19:38.844 --> 19:40.079
TRYING TO TAKE STOCK OF WHAT'S

19:40.079 --> 19:40.946
HAPPENING.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.048
COLLEAGUES OF MINE WHO'VE

19:42.048 --> 19:43.582
BEEN OUT TO VINCENNES, WHICH IS

19:43.582 --> 19:45.351
WHERE THE SUPERMARKET, THE

19:45.351 --> 19:47.153
KOSHER SUPERMARKET HAD HOSTAGES

19:47.153 --> 19:48.387
TAKEN YESTERDAY, SAY THAT THE

19:48.387 --> 19:50.222
FEELING THERE IS EVEN WORSE.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.391
THERE'S JUST THIS SENSE OF

19:52.391 --> 19:54.360
SIEGE, REALLY, AND THIS FEELING

19:54.360 --> 19:56.262
THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL AT EASE.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.530
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S THIS

19:57.530 --> 19:58.697
SENSE THAT THERE ARE THESE

19:58.697 --> 20:00.099
KILLERS WHO COULD COME AT ANY

20:00.099 --> 20:02.268
TIME, AND IT PUTS PEOPLE REALLY

20:02.268 --> 20:03.235
VERY MUCH ON EDGE.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.270
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE ALSO

20:04.270 --> 20:05.471
SEEING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

20:05.471 --> 20:06.372
SOLIDARITY.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.873
THERE'S HUGE RALLY ORGANIZED

20:07.873 --> 20:08.340
TOMORROW.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.242
THERE'LL BE A HUGE RALLY WITH

20:10.242 --> 20:11.977
HEADS OF STATE FROM ACROSS

20:11.977 --> 20:13.312
EUROPE, PEOPLE COMING OUT AND

20:13.312 --> 20:14.647
EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY IN FAVOR

20:14.647 --> 20:16.348
OF DEMOCRACY, FREE SPEECH, ALL

20:16.348 --> 20:18.584
OF THESE VALUES THAT THESE

20:18.584 --> 20:20.853
RADICAL KILLERS WERE OPPOSED TO.

20:20.853 --> 20:21.687
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE A SENSE

20:21.687 --> 20:23.656
OF ANXIETY THAT THERE COULD BE

20:23.656 --> 20:24.924
MORE ATTACKS...

20:24.924 --> 20:25.858
>> ABSOLUTELY.

20:25.858 --> 20:26.725
>> Sreenivasan: ...THAT THERE'S

20:26.725 --> 20:27.893
A GREAT DEAL OF UNKNOWN, AND

20:27.893 --> 20:28.994
"HOW DID THESE GUYS GET THROUGH

20:28.994 --> 20:30.429
THE SECURITY SYSTEM?"

20:30.429 --> 20:31.697
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.799
I MEAN, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

20:33.799 --> 20:35.734
CLEARLY HAD A LOT OF TRAINING,

20:35.734 --> 20:37.303
IT SEEMS.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.671
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAS BEEN

20:38.671 --> 20:39.738
REPORTING THAT THEY WERE

20:39.738 --> 20:41.907
PROBABLY WERE TRAINED IN YEMEN.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.109
I MEAN, THEY'VE BEEN RADICALIZED

20:43.109 --> 20:44.543
AND HAVE GOOD TRAINING.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.611
AND YOU NEVER KNOW.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.879
I MEAN, THE FRENCH SECURITY

20:46.879 --> 20:48.347
APPARATUS CAN'T MONITOR

20:48.347 --> 20:50.049
EVERYBODY IN SIGHT.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.484
THERE'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT

20:51.484 --> 20:52.718
THE LIMITS SURVEILLANCE, THE

20:52.718 --> 20:54.320
LIMITS OF DEMOCRACY, BUT THERE

20:54.320 --> 20:55.821
REALLY IS THIS SENSE OF WHO

20:55.821 --> 20:57.189
KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

20:57.189 --> 20:57.690
NEXT.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.757
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY ANXIOUS-

20:58.757 --> 20:59.458
MAKING.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.960
PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO THEIR KIDS

21:00.960 --> 21:03.262
ABOUT THIS, TRYING TO EXPLAIN

21:03.262 --> 21:04.563
THEIR OWN ANXIETIES.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.665
THE KIDS WHO WERE IN SCHOOL WHEN

21:06.665 --> 21:07.666
THIS ALL HAPPENED, WHEN THE

21:07.666 --> 21:09.535
SHOOTING HAPPENED, WHETHER

21:09.535 --> 21:11.470
TEACHERS SHOULD EXPLAIN IT TO

21:11.470 --> 21:11.871
THEM.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.739
I MEAN, EVERYONE IS VERY, VERY

21:13.739 --> 21:14.573
ANXIOUS.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.508
IT'S A FEELING THAT THIS IS

21:15.508 --> 21:16.375
MAYBE THE BEGINNING OF

21:16.375 --> 21:17.877
SOMETHING.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.245
>> Sreenivasan: EARLIER, YOU HAD

21:19.245 --> 21:20.179
ALSO WRITTEN ABOUT THAT THERE IS

21:20.179 --> 21:21.247
ALREADY THIS CONVERSATION

21:21.247 --> 21:22.548
HAPPENING ABOUT THE PLACE OF

21:22.548 --> 21:24.250
IMMIGRANTS IN SOCIETY AND WHAT

21:24.250 --> 21:26.785
THEIR ROLE IS AND HOW FRANCE IS

21:26.785 --> 21:28.420
REALLY CHANGING OVER TIME.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.421
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.090
IT'S A SENSE WHERE MANY PEOPLE

21:31.090 --> 21:32.591
DO NOT FEEL AT HOME IN FRANCE.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.826
OBVIOUSLY, THE JEWS WHO WERE

21:33.826 --> 21:35.394
TARGETED IN THE SUPERMARKET

21:35.394 --> 21:37.363
YESTERDAY, THEY DO NOT FEEL VERY

21:37.363 --> 21:37.963
MUCH AT HOME.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.999
MAYBE SOME OF THESE MUSLIM GUYS

21:39.999 --> 21:41.200
WHO GREW UP IN FRANCE, HAVE

21:41.200 --> 21:42.501
FRENCH PASSPORTS, WENT TO

21:42.501 --> 21:44.203
STUDY JIHAD, THEY PROBABLY DON'T

21:44.203 --> 21:45.104
FEEL VERY MUCH AT HOME IN

21:45.104 --> 21:45.804
FRANCE.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.872
AND THEN, A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

21:46.872 --> 21:48.407
WHO LIVE IN FRANCE DON'T ALWAYS

21:48.407 --> 21:49.542
FEEL AT HOME IN FRANCE.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.809
THERE'S THIS SENSE THAT PEOPLE

21:50.809 --> 21:52.278
DON'T FEEL AT HOME AT HOME,

21:52.278 --> 21:53.479
WHETHER THAT MEANS YOU'RE

21:53.479 --> 21:55.748
JEWISH, MUSLIM OR TRYING TO COME

21:55.748 --> 21:57.616
TO TERMS WITH THESE LARGER

21:57.616 --> 21:58.551
DEBATES.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.351
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER

21:59.351 --> 22:01.120
IT'S KIND OF A CLASH OF

22:01.120 --> 22:02.521
CIVILIZATIONS, WHETHER IT'S JUST

22:02.521 --> 22:04.790
INDIVIDUALS WHO GO AND DO CRAZY

JOYOUS CHILD TO BECOMING ACUTELY

BURDENS THAT MY PARENTS HAD WERE
