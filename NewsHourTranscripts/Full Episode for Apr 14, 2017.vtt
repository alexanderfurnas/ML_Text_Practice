JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.474 --> 00:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: After
16 years
of U.S. military presence and
sacrifice in

00:12.345 --> 00:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan, and yesterday's
historic bomb
drop, where does that country
stand?

00:18.485 --> 00:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: As Easter approaches, we
go to Seville,
Spain, where the decline of
cloistered life

00:25.025 --> 00:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on full display in the city's
crumbling
convents.

00:28.328 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Convents like
Santa Ines here
in Seville are hidden treasures
from an earlier

00:33.633 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
era, once small, but bustling
communities
now with fewer inhabitants and
walls that

00:39.806 --> 00:40.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are decaying.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:42.609 --> 00:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the week's news.

00:46.946 --> 00:53.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.820 --> 00:56.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.656 --> 01:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea
issued a new warning
today to the United States.

01:06.032 --> 01:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came amid signs the North
might be getting
ready for another nuclear test.

01:10.970 --> 01:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vice foreign minister
charged that the
Trump administration is -- quote
-- "more

01:15.375 --> 01:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vicious and more aggressive"
than President
Obama's.

01:18.812 --> 01:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAN SONG RYOL, North Korean Vice
Foreign Minister
(through translator): We are
taking into account

01:24.384 --> 01:28.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the most aggressive and
dangerous option that
the U.S. might come up with, and
we have also

01:28.321 --> 01:32.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
got our options, our
countermeasures ready
in our hands, which means we
will go to war

01:32.459 --> 01:34.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if they choose.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's rising
speculation
that Pyongyang could carry out a
nuclear or

01:37.964 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a missile test tomorrow.

01:40.333 --> 01:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when the North marks the
105th anniversary
of the birth of Kim Il-Sung, who
founded the

01:46.072 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hard-line communist state in
1948.

01:49.175 --> 01:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, Syria and Iran say they
have sent
a -- quote -- "strong message"
to the U.S.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not to attack Syria again.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their foreign ministers met in
Moscow today.

01:59.519 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They warned that another U.S.
military strike
could have grave consequences
for regional

02:04.991 --> 02:07.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and global security.

02:07.060 --> 02:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump ordered a cruise
missile barrage
in Syria last week, after
accusing its government

02:12.432 --> 02:14.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a poison gas attack.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, voters headed toward
a momentous
decision: whether to approve
greatly expanded

02:19.839 --> 02:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
powers for President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan.

02:23.443 --> 02:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunday's referendum has sharply
divided the
country, and European election
observers say

02:29.315 --> 02:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government has tried to
intimidate the
opposition.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Erdogan lashed out at them
today.

02:35.155 --> 02:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Now they say, if
the result is

02:40.827 --> 02:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yes, that means there are a lot
of problems.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who are you?

02:44.731 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, you should know
your place.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not your duty.

02:48.101 --> 02:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't talk about what will
happen if the
result is yes or no.

02:51.504 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Erdogan has
carried out a sweeping
crackdown since an attempted
coup last year.

02:57.677 --> 03:02.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, death
penalty opponents
rallied in Little Rock,
Arkansas, against

03:02.315 --> 03:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans to execute seven death row
inmates by
the end of the month.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The protest featured celebrity
speakers and
hundreds of others.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first execution is scheduled
for Monday
night.

03:14.260 --> 03:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arkansas has not put anyone to
death since
2005, but officials say the
state's supply

03:19.666 --> 03:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a lethal injection drug is
about to pass
its expiration date.

03:25.071 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in San Francisco
is being
asked to block President Trump's
executive

03:29.976 --> 03:32.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order on so-called sanctuary
cities.

03:32.845 --> 03:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It withholds federal funding
from cities that
won't cooperate on deporting
undocumented

03:38.117 --> 03:39.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

03:39.919 --> 03:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Francisco and Santa Clara
counties argued
today for a nationwide
injunction against

03:45.592 --> 03:48.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enforcing the funding ban.

03:48.361 --> 03:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump White House says that
it will not
release logs of its visitors.

03:52.966 --> 03:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement was a break
from President
Obama's practice, but Trump
administration

03:57.503 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials say that it is in line
with what
previous presidents did.

04:01.374 --> 04:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cited privacy and national
security concerns.

04:06.179 --> 04:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Christians around the world
marked this
Good Friday with solemn
observances.

04:10.883 --> 04:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope Francis presided at the
traditional Way
of the Cross procession in Rome,
with thousands

04:16.789 --> 04:18.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in attendance.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this country, hundreds of
people walked
the Brooklyn Bridge in New York
behind a man

04:22.929 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
carrying a cross.

04:25.331 --> 04:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what a massive
bombing says about the U.S. role
in Afghanistan;

04:31.404 --> 04:38.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
decades of sexual abuse
uncovered at a prestigious
private boarding school;
preserving convents

04:38.344 --> 04:50.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Southern Spain; and much
more.

04:50.290 --> 04:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States' involvement
in Afghanistan
was brought into stark relief
yesterday with

04:57.664 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a massive airstrike in the
country's east.

05:00.900 --> 05:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After nearly 16 years, thousands
of casualties
and billions of dollars, where
does the American

05:06.673 --> 05:07.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effort stand?

05:08.007 --> 05:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And is the country any closer to
being stabilized?

05:11.411 --> 05:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage.

05:13.212 --> 05:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The video
shows a remote
mountain valley suddenly
consumed by a blast

05:18.651 --> 05:21.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
equal to 11 tons of TNT.

05:21.788 --> 05:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The weapon, called a Massive
Ordnance Air
Burst, or MOAB, was used for the
first time

05:26.359 --> 05:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the battlefield yesterday in
this strike
against Islamic State forces.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON, Commander U.S.
Forces, Afghanistan:
This was the right weapon
against this target.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Kabul
today, the top
American commander in
Afghanistan, Army General

05:37.603 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Nicholson, called its use a
tactical
decision, not a strategic change
in policy.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

05:44.544 --> 05:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON: The enemy had
created bunkers,
tunnels and extensive mine
fields, and this

05:48.481 --> 05:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapon was used to reduce those
obstacles,
so we can continue our
offensive.

05:53.619 --> 05:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The target
area was a district
in Nangarhar province, where
last weekend

05:57.523 --> 06:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a U.S. special forces soldier
was killed.

06:00.093 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It, along with neighboring Logar
and Kunar
provinces, are rife with Islamic
State activity.

06:06.132 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, the Taliban
also continues
to control and contest broad
swathes of the

06:11.237 --> 06:13.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Afghan countryside.

06:13.172 --> 06:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban and ISIS have
claimed responsibility
for a series of recent attacks
in Kabul that

06:17.844 --> 06:20.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have shaken the capital.

06:20.146 --> 06:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan officials say Thursday's
blast killed
36 Islamic State militants, but
no civilians.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS denied anyone was killed.

06:28.654 --> 06:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan citizens appeared divided
on using
the bomb against ISIS, or
Da'esh, as it's

06:33.459 --> 06:35.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also known.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
very happy,
and these kinds of bombs should
be used in

06:37.897 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future as well, so ISIS is
rooted out from
here.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED AMAN, Kabul Resident
(through translator):
Da'esh is the enemy of
Afghanistan.

06:44.937 --> 06:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are children there,
and they had
casualties from this bombing.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole world condemns this
action.

06:50.410 --> 06:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The U.S. still
has nearly
9,000 troops in Afghanistan, and
General Nicholson

06:55.681 --> 07:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said the NATO force there
needs a few
thousand more troops to train
and advise Afghan

07:00.987 --> 07:02.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

07:02.789 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's those local forces who
continue to take
major casualties in the fight
against the

07:07.293 --> 07:09.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insurgents.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That ongoing fight will surely
be on the agenda
when President Trump's national
security adviser,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
H.R. McMaster, visits Kabul in
the weeks ahead.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on all
of this, we
turn to Pamela Constable.

07:21.741 --> 07:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the Washington Post bureau
chief in
Kabul and Islamabad.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're watching -- catching her,
that is, on
one of her trips home.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pam, we're glad that you're here
to talk about
the developments of the last few
days, but

07:33.986 --> 07:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also to take a look at the
bigger picture
in Afghanistan.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, Kabul, capital
city, how stable
is it?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it feel like?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE, The Washington
Post: Well,
you know, it's a contradiction.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very busy, active city.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you walked around it in the
middle of the
day, you would think you were in
the middle

07:47.467 --> 07:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of any other big, poor, but busy
city.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's a great feeling of
uncertainty
and tension at this time.

07:56.609 --> 08:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a series of very
bad suicide
bombings, most recently the one
at the military

08:01.914 --> 08:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital last month, which was
extremely shocking,
I think, to Kabul residents, who
had gotten

08:07.787 --> 08:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used to a certain sense of
stability and security.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think a lot of that is
gone now.

08:13.392 --> 08:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also a city that really
shows the difficulties
Afghanistan's having
economically.

08:19.365 --> 08:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The streets are full of beggars,
full of drug
addicts, full of people who are
really struggling

08:24.804 --> 08:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and looking for jobs, so it's a
bit of a sad
picture.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
attribute it to?

08:29.675 --> 08:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Oh, that's a
big question.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a big
question.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Many things.

08:34.814 --> 08:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think first and foremost has
to be security.

08:37.483 --> 08:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have got a very
persistent, very
sophisticated Taliban
insurgency, which is

08:43.389 --> 08:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really doing lots and lots of
attacks across
the country, as well in the
capital.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And getting
stronger.

08:50.396 --> 08:56.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Well,
certainly holding
its own, certainly able to carry
out very

08:56.836 --> 09:02.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frightening and persistent
attacks, certainly
not close to winning, but
they're certainly

09:02.208 --> 09:04.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing pretty well.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you have ISIS, which is
known there as
Da'esh, which is a whole other
can of worms,

09:07.647 --> 09:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they say, a very different
sort of enemy,
more ruthless, less interested
in winning

09:13.553 --> 09:20.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hearts and minds, more
foreign-based, more
extreme compared to the Taliban,
and, obviously,

09:20.459 --> 09:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of greater concern to the
neighbors.

09:22.261 --> 09:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, for example, is very
concerned about
ISIS, and less so about the
Taliban, which

09:26.132 --> 09:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they appear to be reaching out
to in many
ways.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's number one.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then following that is a
long list.

09:33.239 --> 09:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's corruption, there's
poverty, there
is tribal and regional problems,
and there's

09:40.680 --> 09:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the persistent divisions within
the government
itself.

09:43.416 --> 09:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people are quite frustrated,
and I think
very disillusioned by the lack
of progress

09:50.256 --> 09:51.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a lot of fronts.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do -- many
people place
the blame there.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, do they blame the U.S.
for not keeping
more troops on the ground?

09:58.531 --> 10:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do they blame the Afghan
government?

10:01.133 --> 10:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: I mean,
there's a tendency
to always blame the guy in
charge.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, that's President
Ghani.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he deserves some of the
blame.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he probably took on more
than he could
chew.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he aimed very, very
high.

10:12.578 --> 10:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he created unrealistic
expectations
of what was possible, given all
the obstacles.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he's made a good-faith
effort.

10:19.251 --> 10:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's done a lot, but
he's also been
really bombarded by so many
problems, corruption

10:25.358 --> 10:32.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being a major one,
administrative lack of
capacity, and these terrible
struggles that

10:33.032 --> 10:37.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have gone on within the
government, because,
as you know, it wasn't an
elected government,

10:37.069 --> 10:38.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
per se.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was sort of a forged or
forced power-sharing
government.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's never really gone that
well.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that has really
hampered them.

10:45.611 --> 10:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, today, The
Washington
Post, one of your colleagues,
has a piece

10:49.715 --> 10:53.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today about the growing
involvement -- you
mentioned it a moment ago -- of
Russia and

10:53.786 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Right.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How is all that
affecting the
stability there?

10:58.391 --> 11:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: The interest
of Iran is
an old one.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran is a neighbor with lots of
trade and
traffic back and forth.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's obviously Shiite.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are many, many, many
Shiite Muslims
in Afghanistan.

11:08.801 --> 11:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a neighbor, but it's
always been
a neighbor that had lots of
political interest

11:14.707 --> 11:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in having influence of all
kinds.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not new.

11:19.745 --> 11:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's relatively new is Russia,
which obviously
is a much more powerful country,
not a neighbor,

11:23.282 --> 11:27.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but close enough, that's showing
every sign
of wanting to get involved, for
the first

11:27.987 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time since the '80s, when,
obviously, they
backed the government there.

11:32.224 --> 11:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you now have,
as William
reported, the U.S. commander
reportedly asking

11:35.961 --> 11:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for -- reportedly asking for
thousands more
U.S. troops to go in there.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there a sense that that could
make a difference?

11:42.535 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: I don't know
the answer
to that.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it certainly would make
an important
psychological difference.

11:49.575 --> 11:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You asked a minute ago about
what Afghans
want.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are very ambivalent.

11:54.680 --> 12:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Afghan administration, both
military and
civilian, very much want more
American military

12:00.586 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Particularly, what they want is
air combat
support, not necessarily ground
troops.

12:05.591 --> 12:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that, if they had
better combat air
support from NATO, from the
U.S., they could

12:11.464 --> 12:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
handle things on the ground.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, anyway, they certainly want
more help.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Afghan people are rather
ambivalent.

12:18.738 --> 12:23.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been -- there's a real
sort of leftover
bitterness and resentment and
sort of complicated

12:23.943 --> 12:27.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legacy of the Western
involvement there militarily.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, the jury is still out.

12:29.882 --> 12:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And after 16
years, it doesn't
get any simpler.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: No, it
doesn't.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Constable of
The Washington
Post, thank you very much.

12:36.722 --> 12:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Very glad to
be here.

12:45.164 --> 12:54.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now an
investigation that uncovered
decades of sexual abuse at one
of the nation's

12:54.974 --> 13:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elite private preparatory
schools, and the
extent to which the school
hushed it up.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story
from our New
York studios.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The report
released last
night focused on a dozen former
teachers at

13:08.754 --> 13:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prestigious boarding school
in Connecticut,
Choate Rosemary Hall.

13:12.858 --> 13:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It recounts the experiences of
24 adult alumni
who were allegedly abused
between 1963 and

13:19.899 --> 13:21.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators said the offenses
ranged from
kissing to groping to rape.

13:25.504 --> 13:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choate hired a law firm with no
previous ties
to the school to lead the
investigation.

13:30.676 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan Saltzman was part of
The Boston Globe
Spotlight team that helped break
the story.

13:35.247 --> 13:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Paul Mones is an attorney
who has represented
sexual abuse survivors at
private schools

13:39.919 --> 13:41.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other institutions.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is not involved in any of the
Choate cases.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jonathan, I want to start with
you.

13:45.558 --> 13:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and your team launched this
series a while
back about this happening at
elite prep schools

13:51.630 --> 13:52.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Northeast.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did this report reveal to
you?

13:55.634 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SALTZMAN, The Boston
Globe: Well,
we had reported on about 110
private schools

14:02.441 --> 14:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New England that had faced
allegations
of sexual abuse over the past 25
years.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we mentioned Choate.

14:11.450 --> 14:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this report was initiated in
response
to that story, and it laid out
in extremely

14:18.224 --> 14:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graphic detail the accounts of
about 24 survivors
of abuse.

14:24.263 --> 14:30.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as you said in your
introduction, some
of these are extraordinarily
graphic descriptions

14:30.769 --> 14:33.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of abuse, rape.

14:33.572 --> 14:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, the most startling
thing about
the report was that, first, the
school named

14:40.212 --> 14:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
12 teachers that they said had
abused kids.

14:45.317 --> 14:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's an extraordinary number,
and we haven't
seen that before in other
schools.

14:50.089 --> 14:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what they also did was
they essentially
owned up to the fact that they
had never reported

14:57.897 --> 15:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these cases of abuse to child
welfare authorities
in Connecticut, even though it
had been required.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is an
incident that
was mentioned in the report of
what would

15:09.742 --> 15:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely qualify of at least
attempted rape
that happened in a swimming pool
on a field

15:13.913 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trip in Costa Rica.

15:15.681 --> 15:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the headmaster to the board
of trustees
essentially labeled it --
pointed to heavy

15:21.020 --> 15:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drinking and inappropriate
behavior.

15:23.989 --> 15:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we find out that the
teacher in question
was still employed as a
principal at a different

15:29.194 --> 15:30.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school until last week.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SALTZMAN: That's right.

15:33.599 --> 15:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choate got in touch with that
public school
in Litchfield, Connecticut, very
recently.

15:41.907 --> 15:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I spoke to a lawyer for that
school district
in Litchfield last night.

15:48.580 --> 15:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said that they had --
that when this
teacher applied, he used a
slight variation

15:55.020 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his name, and that he never
mentioned that
he'd worked at Choate.

16:00.125 --> 16:05.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a running theme that
we found in
a number of our stories, this
whole passing

16:05.597 --> 16:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the trash syndrome, which is
that schools
let teachers go quietly, they
hush it up,

16:12.438 --> 16:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the teachers resurface
somewhere else.

16:14.573 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL MONES, Sexual Abuse
Attorney: What I
found particularly, if I could
just comment

16:18.310 --> 16:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly on it, particularly
interesting is
that the school only acted, only
acted after

16:24.416 --> 16:26.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Boston Globe story.

16:26.185 --> 16:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would have been comfortable
sitting on
their hands if The Boston Globe
didn't call.

16:31.256 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is typical of the behavior
of large institutions
wherein sexual abuse happens
among their ranks.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they follow the same
pattern as the
Catholic Church.

16:41.867 --> 16:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is one interesting part of
the report,
in fact, where, in the summer of
2012 -- 2002

16:50.743 --> 16:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I'm sorry -- it was reported
that they
received reports a teacher had
molested a

16:56.548 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
student.

16:58.350 --> 17:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They called that teacher back to
the school
and basically let this teacher
quietly leave,

17:03.822 --> 17:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, even say -- and I'm
sure you remember
this -- where the teacher would
then get a

17:08.961 --> 17:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recommendation to go work at a
boys school.

17:12.398 --> 17:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to remember that the
Boston Globe
stories on the Catholic Church,
where this

17:17.536 --> 17:21.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
identical behavior was
happening, was -- started
the criminal -- the review of
the criminal

17:21.840 --> 17:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cases in January or February of
2002.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's not like this
happened many years
ago.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we say, oh, in the
Boy Scout cases
I have had or the church cases,
oh, it was

17:31.984 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the '60s or the '70s.

17:33.919 --> 17:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are, like, super smart
people in an
elite institution, and you only
have to -- you

17:39.058 --> 17:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to believe they never read
The New York
Times or The Boston Globe or
listened to the

17:42.694 --> 17:48.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TV or had any knowledge
whatsoever of sexual
abuse to act in such an
opprobrious way to

17:48.867 --> 17:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the welfare of the children even
as late as
2002.

17:51.170 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Paul, you have
taken on
-- your clients have taken on a
lot of different

17:55.207 --> 17:56.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
types of institutions.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have described child
abuse as almost
a perfect crime.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Explain.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL MONES: Right.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a perfect crime because the
victims remain
silent.

18:05.984 --> 18:09.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The perpetrators -- we
underestimate the perpetrators,
because these are very smart
people.

18:09.822 --> 18:15.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the cases of private schools,
we know that
private schools survive or they
are best known

18:15.360 --> 18:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for congeniality, conviviality,
informal relationships,
calling the teachers by their
first name,

18:21.100 --> 18:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming over to the teacher's
house for studying,
maybe for a glass of wine, you
know, when

18:25.871 --> 18:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the kid is 16 -- 15 or 16 years
old.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's this breeding
ground.

18:30.476 --> 18:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these people are very --
perpetrators
are very smart, and they know
how to take

18:34.646 --> 18:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advantage of a place that
doesn't have many
boundaries.

18:38.183 --> 18:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon Saltzman,
we asked Choate
if they would appear, and they
said they would

18:42.054 --> 18:43.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they did send us a
statement.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It says: "We profoundly
apologize.

18:45.991 --> 18:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conduct of these adults
violated the foundation
of our community, the sacred
trust between

18:49.661 --> 18:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students and the adults charged
with their
care.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We honor and thank the survivors
of sexual
misconduct who came forward."

18:55.000 --> 18:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is part of their statement.

18:57.102 --> 19:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Considering that this report
only goes until
2010, what's happening now at
the school?

19:02.141 --> 19:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how are they trying to
prevent this from
happening again in the future?

19:05.878 --> 19:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN SALTZMAN: Well, it's a
good question.

19:08.447 --> 19:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school says that they are --
they have
heightened awareness about this,
that in one

19:16.989 --> 19:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the cases they reported --
there was one
case that they reported to child
welfare authorities.

19:22.661 --> 19:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this was around in 2010.

19:26.832 --> 19:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They discuss greater training,
things like
that.

19:32.704 --> 19:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I should point out that some
other attorneys
that I spoke to who said --
agree with Paul

19:41.146 --> 19:49.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that this is a litany of
horribles, did give
the school credit for being as
frank as they

19:49.087 --> 19:50.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were in this report.

19:50.956 --> 19:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke also to one of the
alumni, and -- who
is the only one identified as
being abused,

19:59.264 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because she came forward to us,
and she gave
them credit for being as frank
as they were.

20:06.238 --> 20:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will give you an example
of how frank
they are.

20:10.409 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This report -- I have never seen
this in another
report from a school -- has a
label on the

20:15.747 --> 20:22.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
top of it saying that it
contains graphic
material and is not suitable
reading for children.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a pretty telling thing to
put on a
report.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL MONES: Right.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I read that and I thought,
really?

20:28.660 --> 20:31.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it was good enough to
sweep under
the rug.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I understand that, but I
thought -- I
was turned of by that.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that, yes, it was that
graphic,
but now they're saying you have
to have -- you

20:39.938 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, keep it away from unwanted
eyes.

20:41.740 --> 20:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I viewed this as being a -- the
only reason,
as I said -- I will have to
reiterate this

20:48.113 --> 20:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- if The Globe didn't come
knocking, if there
wasn't a rising march of voices
of students

20:55.721 --> 21:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from private schools yelling for
relief, Horace
Mann School, St. George's School
around the

21:02.661 --> 21:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, they would have done
nothing at all.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
gentlemen, we
will see you on TV tonight.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL MONES: OK.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks a lot.

21:13.205 --> 21:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SALTZMAN: Thanks, Hari.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
week's news;

21:27.653 --> 21:33.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basketball great Oscar Robertson
on the man
who broke his triple-double
record that has

21:33.959 --> 21:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stood since 1962; and making the
case for
expertise.

21:38.630 --> 21:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Today is Good Friday,
when Christians
around the world commemorate the
crucifixion

21:46.104 --> 21:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Jesus Christ, ahead of Easter
Sunday.

21:49.408 --> 21:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the largest public
displays occurs
each year in Seville, Spain, but
declining

21:54.980 --> 22:00.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faith among the Spanish people
is threatening
a longtime pillar of the
Catholic Church,

22:00.686 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its cloistered convents.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our continuing
series Culture
at Risk.

22:07.726 --> 22:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Everywhere you
turn in Seville,
tradition and history, reminders
of a rich

22:13.699 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religious past.

22:15.734 --> 22:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But rarely seen, Seville's
cloistered convents,
cities within cities behind high
walls, a

22:23.208 --> 22:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece of the fabric of the
community, yet
separate and apart, places like
the convent

22:28.547 --> 22:36.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Santa Ines, founded in 1372
by Maria Coronel,
whose body still lies in repose
in the church's

22:36.088 --> 22:37.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chapel.

22:37.789 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prioress Maria Rebecca Cervantes
Cisneros
joined the sisterhood when she
was just 13

22:42.761 --> 22:44.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years old.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARIA REBECCA CERVANTES
CISNEROS, Prioress
(through translator): Many
people might say

22:46.898 --> 22:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a person doesn't know what
she's doing
at that age, but I think that it
is a gift

22:50.769 --> 22:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from God, and that he is free to
call for
you whenever he wishes.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to this day, I do not
regret having heeded
that call.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yet, in Spain
today, few women
heed that call.

23:02.347 --> 23:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only about 15 percent of the
population even
attends mass.

23:06.618 --> 23:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-five years ago, there
were 41 cloistered
convents in Seville, the highest
concentration

23:12.023 --> 23:13.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Spain.

23:13.759 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, just 15 active ones
remain, and at
Santa Ines, eight nuns,
practicing what's

23:19.464 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
known as their vocation, watch
over this entire
complex.

23:24.369 --> 23:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six of them come not from Spain,
but from
Mexico, including the prioress.

23:28.507 --> 23:33.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARIA REBECCA CERVANTES
CISNEROS: Here in
Europe, there's a very general
crisis of vocations.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Perhaps there's also a lack of
knowledge.

23:36.081 --> 23:40.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe we need to promote
ourselves more, because
people aren't very familiar with
us.

23:40.218 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people think that the life
of a contemplative
is like a useless life.

23:43.588 --> 23:48.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Convents like
Santa Ines here
in Seville are hidden treasures
from an earlier

23:48.560 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
era, once small, but bustling
communities,
now fewer inhabitants now, and
walls that

23:54.766 --> 23:56.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are decaying.

23:56.601 --> 24:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The murals lining the courtyard,
which illustrate
biblical stories and are said to
date to the

24:01.606 --> 24:04.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1400s, are cracking and flaking
away.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, too, are many of its Spanish
tiles.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some are held in place by
fabric.

24:10.215 --> 24:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The structural beams supporting
the entrance
to the outside world, through
which everyday

24:14.519 --> 24:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens enter daily to buy
sweets through
the turnstile, are cracked, in
danger of collapsing.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Weeds grow out of every nook.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO LONGORIA, World Monuments
Fund: This
is one of the two, three
convents that is

24:25.330 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in worst shape.

24:27.165 --> 24:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pablo Longoria
directs projects
in Spain for the world monuments
fund, which

24:31.002 --> 24:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year added Seville's
convents to its
endangered heritage watch list.

24:36.408 --> 24:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With his help, we were given
rare access during
the season of Lent.

24:40.412 --> 24:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even still, many of the nuns
preferred to
remain away from our cameras.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO LONGORIA: Convents are
very old buildings
that were usually kept by the
donation of

24:49.287 --> 24:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens, religious people that
would give
the convents money and products,
and by the

24:57.562 --> 24:58.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nuns.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, 50 years ago, you would have
80 nuns in
this convent.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now you have eight left.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With much less
support.

25:03.902 --> 25:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PABLO LONGORIA: With much less
support and
with many more years.

25:07.439 --> 25:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The average age must be 75 to 80
years.

25:10.308 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: While Santa Ines
has imported
its nuns from Mexico, at Santa
Paula, another

25:16.314 --> 25:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convent less than a mile away,
most of the
20 nuns are from India.

25:21.720 --> 25:27.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Santa Paula was established in
1473 by the
Order of Saint Jerome and,
thanks to the largess

25:27.959 --> 25:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the noble family of a former
prioress,
is in better shape.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is your
favorite?

25:33.131 --> 25:34.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: This.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This one?

25:35.934 --> 25:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nuns here sell their sweets
from a shop,
and even have a small museum
often open to

25:39.704 --> 25:41.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the public.

25:41.439 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with only about a third of
its former
population, the problem of
maintaining this

25:45.310 --> 25:48.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
huge place remains.

25:48.980 --> 25:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This massive church portal,
designed by Italian
sculptor Nicola Pisano and
dating to 1504,

25:55.320 --> 26:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
combines Gothic, Moorish and
Renaissance styles,
but it's been slowly destroyed
by water damage,

26:01.860 --> 26:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spiders nests, an overall lack
of care.

26:04.429 --> 26:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTA VILLANUEVA, Architect
(through translator):
It's more dark here.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's because of the water.

26:09.367 --> 26:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marta Villanueva
has been coming
here since she was a little
girl, and followed

26:12.837 --> 26:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her father into the field of
architectural
restoration.

26:16.608 --> 26:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's now working on a two-year
project to
restore this portal, funded by a
$200,000

26:22.180 --> 26:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grant from the U.S.-based
Annenberg Foundation.

26:25.283 --> 26:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTA VILLANUEVA (through
translator): This
facade is absolutely one of a
kind.

26:31.656 --> 26:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are no others like it in
all of Spain.

26:34.626 --> 26:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most unique aspect is the
capacity it
has to unite different currents,
both aesthetically

26:40.231 --> 26:41.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and in thought.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a synthesis of the culture
that was enriching
all of Seville.

26:44.836 --> 26:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, she says,
the needs of
this convent and others far
outstrip the means

26:49.708 --> 26:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the nuns' orders, which own
them.

26:51.910 --> 26:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTA VILLANUEVA (through
translator): This
type of monument needs continual
maintenance,

26:56.381 --> 26:58.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that requires means to see
them through.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The resources aren't always
there.

27:00.719 --> 27:04.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The World
Monuments Fund is
attempting to bring stakeholders
together

27:04.522 --> 27:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Seville, the religious
orders, the surrounding
communities and the regional
government, to

27:09.661 --> 27:12.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
catalogue the damage and
prioritize the greatest
needs.

27:12.831 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO LONGORIA: The best case
scenario is,
we find, through careful study
of the building,

27:19.170 --> 27:26.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way to make it sustainable
through time,
a way in which the nuns can
stay, they can

27:26.244 --> 27:28.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep their traditions.

27:28.046 --> 27:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many convents
have been lost
already, abandoned or converted
into offices

27:32.450 --> 27:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the municipal government,
museums or event
spaces.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAVIER RODRIGUEZ BARBERAN,
University of Seville:
You feel here like if you work
in a part of

27:39.557 --> 27:41.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the convent.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Javier Rodriguez
Barberan is
a professor of art history at
the University

27:44.763 --> 27:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Seville and, like many here,
grew up around
the convents.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAVIER RODRIGUEZ BARBERAN:
Imagine there are
no nuns inside the convent.

27:52.337 --> 27:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can see beautiful building,
you can see
beautiful works of art, but it's
no more a

27:57.509 --> 27:58.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
convent.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It would be a museum.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It would be a hotel.

28:00.845 --> 28:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be a restaurant, I
don't know, but
no more a convent.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which would mean
the life of
the place is gone.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAVIER RODRIGUEZ BARBERAN:
Exactly.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At Santa Ines,
Prioress Cervantes
is asking the regional
government to make

28:14.359 --> 28:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good on a decades-old pledge to
help restore
her convent.

28:18.463 --> 28:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She hopes they won't have to
close this sanctuary,
but is at peace in any case.

28:22.967 --> 28:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA REBECCA CERVANTES CISNEROS
(through
translator): Even though we are
concerned

28:25.503 --> 28:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the shortage of vocations
and such,
I think you simply forget the
present, leave

28:30.308 --> 28:34.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it aside and give your life and
devotion to
the vocation we have received as
a gift, and

28:34.713 --> 28:36.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest is up to God.

28:36.247 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Seville, Spain.

28:45.857 --> 28:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to
politics, starting
with the backlash some GOP
lawmakers are facing

28:57.268 --> 28:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their home districts this
week.

28:58.937 --> 28:59.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Answer it!

28:59.938 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Answer it!

29:01.906 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the second
major congressional
recess of the year, and
Republicans are again

29:07.278 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing tense encounters with
their constituents.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take last night's raucous town
hall in Mesa,
Arizona.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Shame on you!

29:14.586 --> 29:16.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Shame on you!

29:16.488 --> 29:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
Senator Jeff Flake
was booed lustily during an
exchange on health

29:21.993 --> 29:23.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

29:23.862 --> 29:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Mr. Flake, why is it
that, in Germany,
we have had a universal health
care system

29:32.437 --> 29:33.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
since...

29:33.605 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:37.108 --> 29:39.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Wait a minute.

29:39.644 --> 29:40.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Since 1871?

29:40.645 --> 29:41.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:41.813 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF FLAKE (R), Arizona: Well,
thank you for
that.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just -- I don't happen to
agree.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the free market
system...

29:49.687 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

29:50.755 --> 29:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in South
Carolina on Monday.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WILSON (R), South Carolina:
Obamacare
is denying services, delaying
services.

29:58.730 --> 30:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Joe Wilson heard
it from voters who parroted the
charge he

30:03.434 --> 30:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
once hurled at President Obama.

30:05.703 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: You lie!

30:07.338 --> 30:08.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You lie!

30:08.439 --> 30:10.341 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You lie!

30:10.375 --> 30:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wednesday night,
Colorado constituents
demanded that Representative
Mike Coffman

30:15.413 --> 30:17.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
break with President Trump.

30:17.248 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I would like to know when
you are going
to stop voting with the
president who has

30:21.052 --> 30:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a 35 percent approval rating,
and start fighting
for Coloradans?

30:24.455 --> 30:25.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

30:25.523 --> 30:27.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:27.192 --> 30:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE COFFMAN (R), Colorado: When
I disagree
with the president, I will speak
out with

30:30.361 --> 30:31.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

30:31.362 --> 30:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm not going to do it every
other day.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's when it's something
significant.

30:34.699 --> 30:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Attendees at that
event had
to show an I.D., and limit signs
to notebook

30:39.838 --> 30:41.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
size.

30:41.306 --> 30:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other Republicans have opted
against holding
mass voter events at all.

30:45.677 --> 30:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, some are conducting
tele-town halls
over the phone and social media.

30:50.882 --> 30:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A big question is, will the
anger translate
beyond town halls?

30:58.590 --> 31:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week in Kansas, in a
rock-solid Republican
district, the GOP only narrowly
won a special

31:05.530 --> 31:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election for the House seat
vacated by Mike
Pompeo, who's now director of
the CIA.

31:11.803 --> 31:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's another closely watched
special House
election next Tuesday in Georgia
to replace

31:18.176 --> 31:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Price, the new secretary of
health and
human services.

31:23.348 --> 31:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with that, we turn to the
analysis of
Shields and Brooks.

31:26.517 --> 31:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Welcome,
gentlemen.

31:32.590 --> 31:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, David, what do you make of
all this hostility
at some of the town halls?

31:37.695 --> 31:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think there
are two issues
here.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is the hostility of the town
hall.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure what to make of
that.

31:42.834 --> 31:48.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it means that
progressives are as
enraged as the Tea Party people
were of several

31:48.573 --> 31:50.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

31:50.308 --> 31:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The larger issue is the shift in
the polls
in that Kansas race and some of
the other

31:53.077 --> 31:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
races and the shift that we see
in the polls
generally.

31:55.813 --> 32:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's less -- that's not
only the fact
progressives are more energized,
but it's

32:00.852 --> 32:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also the drifting away of
Republicans from
the Trump administration.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not happening on a
state level, so
this is Trump-related.

32:07.825 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if I were a House member
with -- maybe
if I had won my last seat, and I
am Republican,

32:12.063 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by 10 or 15 points, I think I
would be more
nervous than ever before in my
career.

32:16.734 --> 32:19.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
attribute all this
to?

32:19.671 --> 32:24.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, Judy, the
Joe Wilson segment was
particularly appropriate,

32:24.676 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Carolina.

32:26.277 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was September 2009 where Joe
Wilson, I
think, changed American
politics.

32:32.116 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a member of the House of
Representatives
then, as he is now.

32:35.653 --> 32:40.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Barack Obama was
addressing the
Congress on Medicare, joint
session, and the

32:40.291 --> 32:45.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
president said illegal
undocumented immigrants
wouldn't be covered under the
health care

32:45.430 --> 32:47.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plan.

32:47.198 --> 32:53.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Joe Wilson broke all
customs, traditions
and stood up and said, "You lie,
you lie,"

32:53.638 --> 32:57.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and he was reprimanded
officially by the House
of Representatives.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He had to apologize.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He apologized personally.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He raised $1.5 million the next
week.

33:03.181 --> 33:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when it -- learned
that there wasn't
a consequence to such behavior.

33:09.454 --> 33:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it sort of, I think, really
raised to
a different level the
polarization and the

33:15.093 --> 33:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
personalization of our politics,
that anything
goes as long as you raise money.

33:19.297 --> 33:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was kind of a
turning point.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I really feel that
way.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I agree with David.

33:25.570 --> 33:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is energy, there's
no question,
and passion, just as there was
then against

33:31.009 --> 33:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama in 2009, 2010.

33:34.379 --> 33:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There isn't any trace of any
racial component
to the opposition to President
Trump, but

33:40.685 --> 33:42.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is passion.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's what you see.

33:44.155 --> 33:49.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I would be worried about,
Democrats should
be, that this looks
orchestrated, that it

33:49.227 --> 33:53.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
looks planned, that the
Democratic National
Committee sent out a message
saying, get in

33:53.798 --> 34:00.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Flake's grill, so that it's
not just
a question of spontaneity, of
people expressing

34:00.071 --> 34:06.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their own opposition or
criticism about policies,
but, instead, sort of
organizing.

34:07.011 --> 34:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it starts to ring of an
organized effort,
I think it hurts.

34:10.415 --> 34:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as the special House
elections, they're
always aberrational, but if the
Democrats

34:16.687 --> 34:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to win the House in
2018, they have
to win districts like the one in
Georgia,

34:21.592 --> 34:22.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
which...

34:22.593 --> 34:24.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The one that is
up next Tuesday.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... Mitt Romney
won by 20 points
and Donald Trump only won by
two.

34:27.031 --> 34:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's twice as college-educated a
population,
electorate as the reset of the
state.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the kind of place
they have to
break through.

34:34.338 --> 34:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What determines,
David, whether
Democrats stay energized or not?

34:39.177 --> 34:43.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, we have
learned that hatred
is the organizing -- the great
organizing

34:43.748 --> 34:45.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
principle in politics.

34:45.650 --> 34:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, they have done
so poorly in
the midterms because their
output, their turnout

34:50.388 --> 34:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tends to be low in those races.

34:53.591 --> 34:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, to me, it's very
hazardous to linearly
project out.

34:58.563 --> 35:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen in the last week
the Trump administration
shift in a radical way.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so something really bad
could happen,
something really good could
happen, but the

35:07.605 --> 35:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
odds that the future a year from
now will
look like the present, those
strike me as

35:11.409 --> 35:12.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
infinitesimally low.

35:12.877 --> 35:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in a position there is
just wide variance
on what could happen.

35:16.314 --> 35:21.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm not sure it makes
much sense to
think, what is 2018 going to
look like, because

35:21.052 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are probably -- as many
days as there
are between now and then, that's
how many

35:24.622 --> 35:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changes of directions we're
probably going
to see.

35:26.390 --> 35:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: One quick measure
of prospects
is the ability to translate that
enthusiasm

35:31.963 --> 35:33.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into contributions.

35:33.764 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Democratic candidate in
Georgia, Jon
Ossoff, who is really untried,
untested, I

35:39.170 --> 35:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, a young man, 30 years old,
with a very
thin resume, has raised over
$8.5 million.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of it from
out of state.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Most of it
overwhelmingly from
out of state.

35:49.947 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Democrats did last
capture the House
from the Republicans in 2006,
one of the reasons

35:55.186 --> 36:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they did is that the Democrats,
under Rahm
Emanuel's leadership, now the
mayor of Chicago,

36:00.992 --> 36:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devoted incredible effort to
recruiting candidates
who fit with the districts in
which they ran.

36:07.532 --> 36:12.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when they ran Blue Dog
Democrats, conservative
to moderate Democrats in
conservative to moderate

36:12.203 --> 36:13.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, they have kind of
turned over
the nominating process to
national liberal

36:16.941 --> 36:19.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
groups and whomever they
support.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's been a
mistake and I think
they have paid for it at the
polls.

36:22.747 --> 36:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: If I could make
one quick comment
about the town halls, I probably
wouldn't

36:25.683 --> 36:26.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go to them.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Like, I love political
discussion.

36:28.486 --> 36:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having people shout at each
other, even
if you agree, it's just -- I
think it's bad

36:32.924 --> 36:34.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in general.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether you agree with them or
not, it's just
not a conversation.

36:35.993 --> 36:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just umbrage and it's a
little bit theatrical.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they used to
be very quiet,
didn't they?

36:40.565 --> 36:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a big change.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, David, you mentioned a
minute ago something
that I do want to ask you both
about.

36:45.169 --> 36:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is what appears to be a
change in
position by the president on a
number of things,

36:50.841 --> 36:56.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around trade, around NAFTA, that
he's going
to declare China a currency
manipulator on

36:56.480 --> 36:59.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day one, that he's going to get
health care
passed.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a different issue,
that you have
to have Congress go along.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Janet Yellen at
the...

37:03.721 --> 37:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Janet Yellen, the
chairman
of the Federal Reserve.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's going on
here?

37:08.025 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are these genuine changes of
opinion?

37:10.394 --> 37:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What -- how do you see it?

37:11.629 --> 37:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Certainly struck
by it.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of data points
all of a sudden.

37:14.532 --> 37:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most people, if they --
especially if
you're an academic or an writer,
if you spend

37:18.936 --> 37:23.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many months arguing that China's
a manipulator,
a currency manipulator, you
don't just then

37:23.507 --> 37:24.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turn on a dime.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump is different.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a marketing guy.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a business guy, whatever is
working for
him at the moment.

37:30.414 --> 37:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems, from this many
data points,
he's making the conclusion that
the populism

37:35.119 --> 37:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Bannon-ism is not
working, and he's
going to go to something else.

37:38.723 --> 37:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what exactly that else
thing is, we don't
really know.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be sort of a
corporatism.

37:43.995 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could be, let me trust my
business guys,
let's go to the CEOs, and let's
-- those guys,

37:48.399 --> 37:50.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can trust.

37:50.234 --> 37:55.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There seems to be some
instinctual sense that
he's shifting teams of who he
wants to be

37:55.172 --> 37:56.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his key advisers.

37:56.841 --> 38:00.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with Trump, because he knows
so little,
it's not him personal initiating
policy.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crucial question is, who is
he listening
to?

38:02.813 --> 38:07.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a clear shift, at
least in one
week, that there has been a
radical shift

38:07.218 --> 38:09.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in his advisee team.

38:09.053 --> 38:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it is a
remarkable number
of issues that the president
appears, Mark,

38:16.594 --> 38:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be taking the opposite stand
from what
he said during the campaign.

38:20.164 --> 38:22.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, you're right,
Judy.

38:22.233 --> 38:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even during the campaign, when
he said things
that were inconsistent or
occasionally contradictory,

38:27.471 --> 38:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the defense, the rebuttal of
this on the part
of his supporters was, hey, he
may not always

38:33.444 --> 38:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be -- but he says what he means,
and he means
what he says, and the guy just
doesn't say

38:38.816 --> 38:42.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it all of the time with polish,
but he says
it with conviction.

38:42.520 --> 38:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, his convictions turned out
to have the
shelf life of a used kleenex.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They just disappear.

38:49.894 --> 38:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, now he's moved
toward orthodoxy,
sort of a Republican orthodoxy,
business -- pro-business

38:56.701 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
orthodoxy, international
responsibility, America
is the -- if not the policeman
of the world,

39:02.873 --> 39:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then certainly a projector of
force and influence
in maintaining security around
the world.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, just in
the last week,
the bomb that was dropped in
Afghanistan,

39:10.314 --> 39:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the strike in Syria, right.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The bomb in
Afghanistan.

39:13.651 --> 39:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in both Afghanistan and
Syria, there wasn't
any consequence of -- real
likely consequence

39:19.724 --> 39:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of any national retaliation to
the United
States.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were enormous acts.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they got the world's
attention.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
North Korea is different.

39:29.867 --> 39:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tough talk in North Korea is
not going
to stop Kim Jong-un from -- I
don't think,

39:35.506 --> 39:37.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from a nuclear test.

39:37.341 --> 39:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the consequences in
North Korea
and our dealing with North Korea
really are

39:44.215 --> 39:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormously consequential and
very, very serious,
and should be of concern to
everybody involved.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, the
president,
it seems to me, has been pretty
loose with

39:52.022 --> 39:53.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tweets.

39:53.791 --> 39:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been saying, if China
doesn't help us
get North Korea in line, we will
go it alone,

39:58.162 --> 39:59.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we will do it ourselves.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
One is always unnerved.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The North Korea situation is
unnerving.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have to say, I think the
president has
had a good week on the subject.

40:05.936 --> 40:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shift in China, the harsher
tone from
China toward North Korea, the,
in effect,

40:11.108 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drawing a red line against North
Korea and
also against us, that's a win.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a very significant
development, that
China is clearly upset, clearly
concerned

40:20.718 --> 40:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what's going on, and
they're willing
to step into North Korea and
say, don't cross

40:24.588 --> 40:25.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that line.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that is a significant
shift.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one has to give some credit
to Donald
Trump.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And two things have happened.

40:32.630 --> 40:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the Syria thing happened,
and the sense
that the U.S. is sort of active
again in the

40:37.201 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world, which it hasn't been for
many years.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, second -- and I made this
point last
week, and Mark didn't respond
favorably to

40:42.706 --> 40:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it -- which is, there is some
advantages and
disadvantages to having an
unpredictable guy

40:47.812 --> 40:48.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as president.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Disadvantages if
you're an ally,
but some advantages toward the
enemy, because

40:52.383 --> 40:54.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they don't know what's
happening.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I do think the more
assertive U.S. has
had some role in this and
progress on the

40:58.656 --> 40:59.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
North Korea thing.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A week later,
where are you?

41:01.292 --> 41:04.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: A week later, I
accept David's
apology.

41:04.795 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:05.796 --> 41:07.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

41:07.598 --> 41:12.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, Judy, I mean,
unpredictability is
not the defining -- shouldn't be
the defining

41:12.336 --> 41:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
characteristic of a presidency.

41:15.439 --> 41:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the ability to take new
information
and to change direction, you
know, yes, and

41:21.111 --> 41:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change policy, is there any
indication that
there is any thought been given
to this policy?

41:25.883 --> 41:30.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the great consolation
that people
in Washington take, whether they
should or

41:30.788 --> 41:37.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they shouldn't, is James Mattis,
General McMaster,
you know, that these are people
of seriousness,

41:37.795 --> 41:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rex Tillerson, people of
stability and consequence.

41:42.766 --> 41:47.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They don't have anything
comparable at the
home -- on the domestic side.

41:47.805 --> 41:50.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, you know, that's it.

41:50.074 --> 41:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't think you can have
somebody do
it on whim and by tweet.

41:54.345 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really -- David's far more
sanguine
about North Korea and China
right now than

41:59.283 --> 42:00.251 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

42:00.284 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm not
saying sanguine.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm saying progress.

42:03.153 --> 42:06.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think this emphasizes a
point, is
that we could be moving toward
an administration

42:06.423 --> 42:11.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Trump is less dominant and
less influenced
by Bannon, who I think was a
very bad influence,

42:11.428 --> 42:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you get a team of advisers
who are building
a structure around him, and the
McMasters

42:16.534 --> 42:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Gary Cohns and maybe the
Jared Kushners.

42:19.336 --> 42:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we could be going into
something that
looks a little more like Cabinet
government

42:22.506 --> 42:27.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than we have seen in a while,
where Gary Cohn
does what he wants on economic
policy, Jeff

42:27.478 --> 42:32.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions continues to do what he
wants in
a more populist on immigration
policy, and

42:32.182 --> 42:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're looking to the second tier
to actually
making more decisions, and maybe
the top guy

42:36.453 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is just out doing his tweets.

42:38.155 --> 42:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Gary Cohn better
be careful.

42:39.990 --> 42:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He better not be on a "Saturday
Night Live"
skit featured as the dominant
figure in the

42:45.796 --> 42:46.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

42:46.797 --> 42:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Referring back to
Steve Bannon.

42:48.165 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He better not be
on the cover
of "TIME" magazine.

42:50.067 --> 42:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, in itself, I think -- I
mean, Donald
Trump, whatever else he is, we
know, is sensitive

42:56.907 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, aware and keenly interested
in publicity
and who gets attention.

43:01.612 --> 43:11.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to think that Steve
Bannon's star
wasn't elevated or helped by the
kind of attention

43:11.589 --> 43:13.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he got in the press.

43:13.457 --> 43:17.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Saturday Night
Live" is -- an
unforgettable image of him as
the -- death,

43:17.494 --> 43:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just the Grim Reaper, but
death.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

43:23.667 --> 43:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's right, and the dominant
figure with
his puppet.

43:24.935 --> 43:29.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you both.

43:29.340 --> 43:44.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NBA playoffs games begin
this weekend,
and they come as one of the
game's superstars

43:44.088 --> 43:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just broke a historic record
this week.

43:47.024 --> 43:53.597 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
John Yang has
the story.

43:53.631 --> 43:57.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Oklahoma City Thunder
point guard
Russell Westbrook did something
this season

43:57.267 --> 44:00.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no player has done in 55 years.

44:00.738 --> 44:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He averaged double digits in
points, assists
and rebounds, a triple-double.

44:07.511 --> 44:10.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The last NBA Player to do that?

44:10.848 --> 44:16.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oscar Robertson with the old
Cincinnati Royals
in the 1961-'62 season.

44:16.186 --> 44:22.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's more, Westbrook was the
league's leading
scorer this year, averaging 31
points a game,

44:22.559 --> 44:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including this game winner.

44:24.695 --> 44:30.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON, Former NBA
Player: When Russell
was on this journey, I felt that
I just had

44:30.768 --> 44:32.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be here.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Robertson, a Hall of
Fame point
guard who was a 12-time All-Star
and league

44:34.471 --> 44:41.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MVP, honored Westbrook before
the Thunder's
final regular season game.

44:41.779 --> 44:46.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining us from Cincinnati
now is Oscar
Robertson, who, by the way, was
the first

44:46.684 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-American president of a
pro sports
labor union and brought the
lawsuit that led

44:51.388 --> 44:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to free agency in the NBA.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Robertson, thanks so much
for joining
us.

44:55.759 --> 44:57.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Help us understand this
accomplishment.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Put it into context.

44:59.830 --> 45:08.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How difficult is it to achieve a
triple-double,
and why did it take so long for
someone to

45:08.338 --> 45:11.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
match your accomplishment in the
'61-'62 season?

45:12.009 --> 45:18.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: Well, I don't
know, because
I guess they weren't counting
that much about

45:18.148 --> 45:20.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
triple-doubles to begin with.

45:20.617 --> 45:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do believe -- and I have
said this to
many of my friends who are
basketball players

45:24.221 --> 45:30.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- when Kevin Durant left
Oklahoma, it opened
the door for Russell Westbrook.

45:30.894 --> 45:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he came through it with a
lot of vigor,
and look what he's done with it.

45:37.301 --> 45:38.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He had to attack.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They had a team.

45:40.170 --> 45:43.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They probably didn't think the
team would
be worthy enough because Kevin
Durant left.

45:43.040 --> 45:46.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Russell Westbrook stepped up
to the plate
and delivered.

45:46.310 --> 45:51.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But to do this, to
get the triple-double,
you have got to be an all-around
player.

45:51.348 --> 45:53.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to have the power
drive to score.

45:53.851 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got to have the hustle
to rebound
and the sort of playmaking for
the assists.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, is that why this is such a
rare accomplishment?

46:03.160 --> 46:09.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: No, I think the
rarity of
it is that the assists are going
to be there

46:09.433 --> 46:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the scoring, of course,
because he's a
tremendous basketball, offensive
basketball

46:12.503 --> 46:13.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
player.

46:13.504 --> 46:15.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The real key is, can you get the
rebounds?

46:15.372 --> 46:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was speaking to him the
other, and he
agreed, said that was the
toughest thing to

46:18.542 --> 46:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get is the rebounds sometimes.

46:20.577 --> 46:22.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you get with a certain team.

46:22.412 --> 46:29.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, in this electronic age,
and you have
to be able to go inside to help
your big people

46:29.720 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebound, if you don't have a
dominated rebounding
team, like -- and I don't think
Oklahoma State

46:33.657 --> 46:37.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has got much of a rebounding
team compared
to some of the other teams in
the league.

46:37.528 --> 46:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How did you feel
about Westbrook
breaking your record for the
number of double-triples

46:43.734 --> 46:50.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a season and also matching --
having double-triples
for -- averaging double-triples
for the full

46:50.107 --> 46:51.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
season?

46:51.608 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: Well, I thought
about it,
and I just said I felt happy.

46:55.612 --> 47:00.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt very happy for Russell,
because it
was a tremendous treat, historic
in nature,

47:00.184 --> 47:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because -- you know, it's just a
funny thing
that, when I did these things in
the '60s,

47:06.590 --> 47:09.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no one even knew anything --
knew what a triple-double
was.

47:09.393 --> 47:12.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Russell -- this is a new age
now in basketball.

47:12.496 --> 47:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are -- you're seeing,
this year, they
drew more fans than they have in
the history

47:16.200 --> 47:17.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of basketball.

47:17.367 --> 47:18.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Russell Westbrook has
stepped up to the
plate.

47:18.635 --> 47:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he's on the court, man,
everybody wants
to see him play.

47:22.906 --> 47:24.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is really something.

47:24.775 --> 47:28.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as people think
about it a little
bit, they are going to think
much more than

47:28.512 --> 47:30.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they do right now.

47:30.314 --> 47:33.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: When you were in
Oklahoma City
with Westbrook the other day,
you charted

47:33.650 --> 47:34.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The chant, "MVP."

47:34.651 --> 47:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do you think he should be
MVP this year?

47:36.620 --> 47:37.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:37.621 --> 47:39.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: Look what he
did.

47:39.756 --> 47:40.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He broke a record.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been there 55 years.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why shouldn't he be the MVP?

47:44.161 --> 47:47.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think what he's done has
been marvelous.

47:47.431 --> 47:54.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said before, he took a team
that people
didn't think was going very far,
although

47:54.338 --> 47:58.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't -- some other teams have
gotten more
wins than they have, but, as far
as being

47:58.809 --> 48:03.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
electrifying and drawing fans to
the arena
to see them play, he is the MVP
of the league.

48:03.180 --> 48:08.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talk about
electrifying the
fans and drawing them in, this
weekend, of

48:08.051 --> 48:09.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
course, the playoff start.

48:09.987 --> 48:16.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, Westbrook will be
facing off against
another top candidate of the
MVP, James Harden

48:16.193 --> 48:17.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Houston Rockets.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think of that
matchup?

48:19.463 --> 48:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: I think this is
what championship
basketball is all about.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You get the play the tough, best
competition.

48:25.936 --> 48:28.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's going to be more spirited.

48:28.639 --> 48:30.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The fouls will be harder.

48:31.008 --> 48:34.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the drives will be a little
bit with more
definition to them.

48:34.678 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be difficult for
anybody that
gets through there, because
they're in a difficult

48:39.316 --> 48:45.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference with San Antonio,
with the Clippers
and, of course, the Golden State
Warriors.

48:45.289 --> 48:46.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think?

48:46.623 --> 48:48.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you looking for in the
playoffs this
year?

48:48.558 --> 48:50.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You going to make a prediction
for us?

48:50.227 --> 48:55.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSCAR ROBERTSON: Well, I will
just go what
has gone, what has happened so
far.

48:55.866 --> 48:58.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Golden State is the team
to beat.

48:58.101 --> 49:02.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have shown that they can --
they have
a team that can adjust to play
against almost

49:02.139 --> 49:03.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anybody.

49:03.974 --> 49:08.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though Durant's been
out, he's back
now, and so they haven't -- they
didn't miss

49:08.912 --> 49:09.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a beat when he was out.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they're going to move
forward.

49:11.348 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure they're going to be
the team
to bet on the West Coast.

49:15.352 --> 49:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the East Coast, it's up in
the air.

49:16.353 --> 49:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no real dominant team.

49:18.121 --> 49:21.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cleveland looked like they were
dominant for
a while, but they have got some
injuries.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as LeBron said, we're not
playing tough
enough.

49:23.994 --> 49:27.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I guess something is going
to happen pretty
soon whereby that may change.

49:27.497 --> 49:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it doesn't change, they're
not going to
win the championship.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We will see starting
this weekend.

49:32.836 --> 49:37.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oscar Robertson, thanks so much
for joining
us.

49:37.674 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
essay

49:41.111 --> 49:51.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
the latest
installment in our series of
essays.

49:51.822 --> 49:57.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Nichols, author of the book
"The Death
of Expertise," shares his Humble
Opinion on

49:57.260 --> 49:59.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the demise of experts.

49:59.196 --> 50:03.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM NICHOLS, Author, "The Death
of Expertise":
A few years ago, a mischievous
group of pollsters

50:03.867 --> 50:07.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked American voters whether
they would support
bombing the country of Agrabah.

50:07.571 --> 50:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you might expect, Republicans
tended to
support military action, while
Democrats were

50:12.776 --> 50:13.844 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more reluctant.

50:13.877 --> 50:17.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's only one problem:
Agrabah doesn't
exist.

50:17.647 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's from the animated Disney
film "Aladdin."

50:19.816 --> 50:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only about half the people
surveyed figured
this out, and liberals and
conservatives gleefully

50:24.788 --> 50:26.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pointed fingers at each other.

50:27.024 --> 50:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For experts in foreign affairs,
however, there
was no way around the alarming
reality that

50:31.795 --> 50:37.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so many Americans had a
well-defined view
on bombing a cartoon.

50:37.401 --> 50:38.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm one of those experts.

50:38.969 --> 50:42.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I teach both civilians and
military officers
about national security affairs.

50:42.672 --> 50:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my career, I have advised the
Pentagon,
the CIA, and political leaders
from both major

50:48.178 --> 50:49.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parties.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Increasingly, however, laypeople
don't care
about expert views.

50:52.682 --> 50:58.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, many Americans have
become insufferable
know-it-alls, locked in constant
conflict

50:58.355 --> 51:02.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with each other, while knowing
almost nothing
about the subject they are
debating.

51:03.026 --> 51:04.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did this happen?

51:04.961 --> 51:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How is it that people now not
only doubt expert
advice, but believe themselves
to be as smart,

51:10.267 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or even smarter, than
experienced professionals?

51:14.204 --> 51:18.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents who refuse to vaccinate
a child, for
example, aren't really
questioning their doctors.

51:19.009 --> 51:20.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're replacing their doctors.

51:20.977 --> 51:25.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have decided that attending
the university
of Google, as one anti-vaccine
activist put

51:25.348 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, is the same as going to
medical school.

51:28.318 --> 51:32.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who have no idea how much
the United
States spends on foreign aid
think that they're

51:32.589 --> 51:35.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the peers of experienced
diplomats.

51:35.692 --> 51:38.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Experts in almost every field
can tell similar
stories.

51:38.662 --> 51:40.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of blame to go
around for all
of this.

51:40.797 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The smartphones and tablets that
we carry
around all day that we think can
answer anything

51:44.701 --> 51:46.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are only part of the problem.

51:46.770 --> 51:51.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American educational system,
from grade
school to graduate school,
encourages students

51:51.475 --> 51:53.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to think of themselves and their
views as
special.

51:53.977 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
An A is now a common grade.

51:56.613 --> 52:01.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The news media, while trying to
tell people
what they need to hear, must
compete for ears,

52:01.184 --> 52:06.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes, and clicks, and so are
also forced to
ask them what they'd like to
hear.

52:06.823 --> 52:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if we manage to avoid
the intellectual
saboteurs of the Internet, we're
still all

52:11.528 --> 52:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too likely to get our news and
views from
social media, where a silly meme
from your

52:16.399 --> 52:22.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
aunt Rose in Schenectady
competes for your
attention with actual
information.

52:22.305 --> 52:26.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to find our way back
from this ego-driven
wilderness.

52:26.109 --> 52:30.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, people return to
valuing expert
views in times of trouble or
distress.

52:30.881 --> 52:35.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're all willing to argue with
our doctors
until our fever is out of
control.

52:35.752 --> 52:37.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's hope it doesn't come to
that.

52:37.521 --> 52:39.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's where we're headed.

52:39.389 --> 52:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless we start accepting
the limitations
of our own knowledge, then each
of us is failing

52:43.560 --> 52:49.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our obligation to participate
in our democracy
as involved, but informed
citizens.

52:49.466 --> 52:56.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can find
more expert
views from our series In My
Humble Opinion.

52:56.773 --> 52:58.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site.

52:58.909 --> 53:04.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also online: Meet a storm chaser
who studies
tornadoes, not with a pickup
truck, but a

53:04.881 --> 53:06.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supercomputer.

53:06.383 --> 53:10.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He explains how his simulations
could one
day improve tornado forecasting.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.624 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Again, that's at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:14.658 --> 53:19.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Washington
Week": How have
President Trump's foreign policy
priorities

53:19.496 --> 53:21.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shifted since he took office?

53:21.831 --> 53:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An all-foreign policy roundtable
reports on
the evolving Trump doctrine and
what it signals

53:27.070 --> 53:28.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the global community.

53:28.972 --> 53:34.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on tomorrow's edition of
"PBS NewsHour
Weekend": a report on why
hundreds of undocumented

53:34.711 --> 53:41.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants are flocking from the
U.S. to Canada,
crossing the open northern
border on foot.

53:41.851 --> 53:43.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday.

53:43.720 --> 53:48.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Tax Day approaches, we will
look at protests
over President Trump's decision
not to release

53:48.658 --> 53:50.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his tax returns.

53:50.260 --> 53:51.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:51.928 --> 53:52.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:52.929 --> 53:54.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have a great Easter weekend.

53:54.431 --> 54:04.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you -- and Passover -- and
good night.

54:04.541 --> 54:10.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you -- and Passover -- and
good night.
