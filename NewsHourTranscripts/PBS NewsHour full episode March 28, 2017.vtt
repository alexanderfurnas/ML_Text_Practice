JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.038 --> 00:06.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:07.841 --> 00:11.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Together, we're going to start a
new energy

00:11.111 --> 00:12.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
revolution.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
starts the
rollback of Obama era clean
energy policies,

00:16.516 --> 00:21.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a move that he says will
create jobs and
energy independence.

00:21.121 --> 00:27.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Top Democrats demand House
Intelligence
Chairman Devin Nunes recuse
himself from the

00:27.995 --> 00:33.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation into Russian and
Trump ties
after allegations of
coordinating with the

00:33.767 --> 00:35.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

00:35.802 --> 00:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Syrian refugees fleeing war
face new challenges
in Turkey, where political and
economic upheaval

00:42.609 --> 00:44.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer few a stable home.

00:44.578 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: They have no
real access
to state services and are
treated like second-class

00:49.449 --> 00:51.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
citizens.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may be safe from war, but
they and their
children are exploited and
vulnerable.

00:54.955 --> 01:02.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:02.896 --> 01:05.732 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.766 --> 01:15.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the
president today, the
first salvo against his
predecessor's climate

01:15.809 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

01:17.811 --> 01:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he's launched an
aggressive campaign
he says will help the coal, oil
and gas industries.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:25.819 --> 01:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With coal miners
looking on at
EPA headquarters, President
Trump took action

01:31.124 --> 01:34.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to undo most of President
Obama's climate
change legacy.

01:34.995 --> 01:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Perhaps no single regulation
threatens our

01:38.532 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miners, energy workers and
companies more
than this crushing attack on
American industry.

01:45.472 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: He signed an
executive order targeting
more than a half-dozen major
regulations.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The biggest target?

01:54.014 --> 01:59.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clean Power Plan to restrict
greenhouse
gas emissions at coal-fired
power plants,

01:59.486 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the centerpiece of Obama's
global warming
policies.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: The idea of setting
standards and

02:04.725 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cutting carbon pollution is not
new.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not radical.

02:09.363 --> 02:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is new is that, starting
today, Washington
is starting to catch up with the
vision of

02:15.802 --> 02:17.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest of the country.

02:17.704 --> 02:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's been on hold
while coal states
and the energy industry
challenged it in court

02:22.175 --> 02:25.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as an unconstitutional power
grab.

02:25.412 --> 02:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's order mandates a review
of the Clean
Power Plan, lifts a moratorium
on new coal

02:30.751 --> 02:36.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leases on federal lands, starts
a review of
reducing methane emissions in
oil and natural

02:36.256 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas production, and launches an
assessment
of rules governing hydraulic
fracturing, also

02:41.361 --> 02:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called fracking, by oil and gas
drillers.

02:44.664 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the campaign, Mr. Trump
slammed the
Obama administration for waging
a war on coal

02:51.705 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and vowed to bring back mining
jobs.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Today, I'm taking
bold action
to follow through on that
promise.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My administration is putting an
end to the
war on coal.

03:01.581 --> 03:05.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have clean coal,
really clean
coal.

03:05.452 --> 03:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But coal mines have
been losing
jobs for many years because of a
range of

03:09.890 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
factors, including automation
and competition
from cheap natural gas.

03:16.563 --> 03:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Environmentalists warned that
the president's
action raise questions about
whether the United

03:20.100 --> 03:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States can meet the obligations
under the
2015 Paris climate agreement.

03:25.005 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the head of the
Sierra Club
said: "President Trump's
sweeping order is

03:29.876 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the single biggest attack on
climate action
in U.S. history, period."

03:34.247 --> 03:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The group vowed an all-out
fight.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:40.520 --> 03:45.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will hear from
voices pro
and con on President Trump's
action today

03:45.492 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

03:47.594 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. commander
in Iraq now says there's a --
quote -- "fair

03:52.199 --> 03:58.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chance" that a U.S. airstrike
played a role
in killing scores of civilians
in Mosul.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It happened on March 17.

04:00.207 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Lieutenant General Stephen
Townsend also
voiced doubt that the weapons
used could have

04:05.212 --> 04:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collapsed an entire building.

04:07.414 --> 04:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, an Iraqi general
claimed the airstrike
actually hit a tanker truck
loaded with explosives

04:13.687 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that ISIS fighters were driving
toward Iraqi
troops.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAHYA RASOOL, Spokesman, Joint
Command Operations
(through translator): It is a
new tactic being

04:20.994 --> 04:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used by the members of this
terrorist group,
using big car bombs against the
troops that

04:25.632 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact the civilians to inflame
the public
and to convey a wrong message to
the world

04:30.137 --> 04:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the joint forces of the
international
coalition are behind the killing
and bombings.

04:34.774 --> 04:39.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amnesty
International charged
today that coalition forces are
not taking

04:39.813 --> 04:43.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken adequate precautions in
the battle for
Mosul.

04:43.416 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Russia today, a warning:
The Defense
Ministry in Moscow says that
U.S. naval patrols

04:48.522 --> 04:52.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Black Sea are a potential
threat to
Russian security.

04:52.125 --> 04:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Black Sea is bounded by
Romania, Bulgaria
and Turkey, as well as Ukraine
and Russia.

04:58.632 --> 05:04.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. American warships took part
in NATO exercises
there last week.

05:04.571 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Thousands of people in
Northeastern Australia
spent a long day waiting out the
fury of Tropical

05:10.710 --> 05:12.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cyclone Debbie.

05:12.546 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm pounded the coastal
region for hours
with heavy rain, towering seas
and winds up

05:18.451 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to 160 miles an hour.

05:21.021 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It tore up trees, ripped up
power lines, and
left nearly 50,000 people in the
dark.

05:27.961 --> 05:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a sex
abuse scandal
involving the USA Gymnastics
Organization

05:33.466 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
took center stage at a Senate
hearing.

05:35.902 --> 05:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of women have come
forward to say
they were sexually assaulted or
exploited

05:41.908 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by coaches, trainers and a team
doctor, Larry
Nassar.

05:46.780 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of his alleged victims,
Olympic medalist
Jamie Dantzscher, tearfully
shared her personal

05:53.653 --> 05:55.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE DANTZSCHER, Olympic
Medalist: Many times,
the abuse took place in my own
room, in my

05:58.191 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own bed.

05:59.626 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Worse, he abused me in my hotel
room in Sydney
at the Olympic Games.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first spoke out about my
abuse at the
hands of Dr. Nassar, I thought I
was the only

06:11.137 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was disbelieved and even
criticized by some
in the gymnastics community for
bringing this

06:16.977 --> 06:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disturbing issue to light.

06:18.878 --> 06:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The former head
of USA Gymnastics,
Steve Penny, resigned under
pressure earlier

06:24.451 --> 06:26.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this month.

06:26.253 --> 06:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A group of U.S. senators is now
pushing a
bill that says groups overseeing
Olympic sports

06:30.690 --> 06:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
must immediately report sexual
abuse allegations
to police.

06:35.528 --> 06:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in Detroit
approved a plan
today to replace water lines at
18,000 homes

06:41.901 --> 06:43.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Flint, Michigan.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of a settlement over
lead contamination.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The deal calls for work to be
done by 2020.

06:49.609 --> 06:54.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It could cost nearly $90
million, with the
federal and state governments
splitting the

06:55.015 --> 06:56.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

06:56.783 --> 07:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, stocks
moved higher
on a survey that showed consumer
confidence

07:01.454 --> 07:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at its highest in more than 16
years.

07:03.957 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 150
points to close at 20701.

07:09.162 --> 07:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 34 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly 17.

07:15.502 --> 07:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more on the
president's decision to roll
back environmental

07:21.574 --> 07:27.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
regulations; the House
Intelligence Committee
chair responds to calls for him
to step aside

07:27.280 --> 07:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Russia investigation;
life on the
U.S.-Mexican border under the
watchful eye

07:33.119 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Border Patrol; and much more.

07:46.566 --> 07:51.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the major promises of
President Trump's
campaign was his pledge to roll
back much

07:51.538 --> 07:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his predecessor's plans for
coping with
climate change.

07:55.508 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today's executive order laid out
a path for
doing that.

07:58.645 --> 08:04.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We invited the administrator of
the EPA on
the air tonight, but he declined
our invitation.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's hear from a leading
lawmaker who supports
these moves.

08:08.421 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's Republican Senator John
Barrasso of Wyoming,
the country's number one
coal-producing state.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He chairs the Energy and Natural
Resources
Committee.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I talked to him a short time
ago.

08:19.699 --> 08:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking how these
moves will
change the American energy
landscape.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO (R), Wyoming:
Well, I think
it was a bold and decisive
action by Donald

08:28.942 --> 08:30.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think is going to be helpful
to energy independence
for America, energy security for
our country,

08:35.281 --> 08:37.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and certainly for jobs.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That, to me, is the key driver.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I think of energy -- I'm
from an energy
state, Wyoming -- I think of
energy security

08:44.324 --> 08:48.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for our country, economic growth
and environmental
stewardship.

08:48.428 --> 08:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's how we have used over
the 125 years
that Wyoming has been a state.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
jobs.

08:54.367 --> 08:59.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As you know, a number of
skeptics are saying,
well, many of those jobs just
are not coming

08:59.472 --> 09:01.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

09:01.207 --> 09:05.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's due to factors other than
what the EPA
did, the environmental rules
have been.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many jobs do you think will
come back
due to this?

09:08.615 --> 09:10.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I think,
across the country
and over the next number of
years, I'm talking

09:13.086 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of thousands, if not
millions of
jobs in the energy sector.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, energy is called the
mastery resource
for a reason.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It powers our country, it powers
the economy,
our military.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Energy is a force multiplier.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an instrument of power.

09:29.769 --> 09:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can get a lot more done,
I believe,
with a barrel of oil than you
can with a barrel

09:33.740 --> 09:34.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a gun.

09:34.874 --> 09:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, energy can also be used as a
geopolitical
weapon.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We need it all.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need the renewable energy.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need the non-renewable
energy.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can't kid ourselves to
say that we're
going to be able to power this
country and

09:46.619 --> 09:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this economy with just solar
panels and windmills.

09:49.222 --> 09:53.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also
mentioned energy independence,
but, again, I hear skeptics
saying, well,

09:53.626 --> 09:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. is already moving
briskly in the
direction of energy
independence, that that's

09:58.798 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already happening.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO: And we want to do
more of that.

10:02.569 --> 10:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You take a look how Vladimir
Putin uses energy
as a weapon, a geopolitical
weapon.

10:07.841 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we export energy, we export
American
influence overseas.

10:13.446 --> 10:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I travel around the world, I
know that
there are people that want to
buy energy from

10:18.051 --> 10:19.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had that discussion in
Japan, in Taiwan.

10:20.753 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had that discussion with
our NATO friends.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want what we have in
abundance.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are a world energy
superpower.

10:29.028 --> 10:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after today, we're going to
be able to
act more like that.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, what
also -- also,
let me ask you about the
argument being made

10:36.836 --> 10:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people in the energy
industry realize
that it's fiscally responsible
to have clean

10:43.943 --> 10:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy, that that is what the
American people
want, and that by doing what the
president

10:49.249 --> 10:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing today, he's turning the
clock back,
and that the American people,
it's not something

10:54.187 --> 10:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the American people really want?

10:55.588 --> 10:56.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the
American people want
affordable energy.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And clean energy is a big part
of that.

11:01.060 --> 11:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take a look at what's
happened in the
United States with emissions,
our emissions

11:05.532 --> 11:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been dropping over the last
15 years.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are down significantly.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't see that in China.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't see that in India.

11:12.772 --> 11:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But America has been leading the
way in reduction
of emissions, new technology.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are, I believe, very good
stewards of the
land, of the environment.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We do it in Wyoming.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done it for a long, long
time, and
we're going to continue to do it
in the future,

11:26.886 --> 11:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because that's who people on the
ground want
to make those decisions, want to
live in clean

11:31.524 --> 11:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
places, and that's the way we do
it at home.

11:33.426 --> 11:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what you're
saying is,
emissions are improving, they
are being reduced.

11:39.265 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But won't some of these changes
the president
is making today, by doing away
with a number

11:44.370 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of restrictions and regulations,
move the
energy in the opposite
direction, away from

11:50.243 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
clean energy?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO: No, I would say
just the opposite.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the technology and the
innovation that
we have had here at home that
has resulted

11:57.250 --> 11:59.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in these reductions in
emissions.

11:59.519 --> 12:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember that President Obama's
clean climate
plan, that's something that has
been stayed

12:04.290 --> 12:06.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the courts.

12:06.359 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's made promises that even
the environmental
folks who look at this from a
scientific standpoint

12:12.031 --> 12:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say the impacts of something
like the Paris
accord would be over the next
100 years negligible.

12:17.170 --> 12:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's important to
focus on our
economy, on jobs, on getting
America back

12:22.642 --> 12:23.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to work.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was in Wyoming just yesterday.

12:25.645 --> 12:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, I was in a little
mini-mart store,
and somebody came in guy and
said to the guy

12:29.315 --> 12:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in front of me in line, how are
things going?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, great, we're hiring
again.

12:33.786 --> 12:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are good signs for our
country that
the economy is picking up,
moving ahead.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And energy is a very big part of
that.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need it all, we need the
renewable,
we need the non-renewable, we
need the nuclear,

12:44.631 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need it all, coal, oil, gas,
uranium.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We need it all.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to use it all to
power our
economy, as well as the country.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One final thing,
Senator.

12:54.941 --> 13:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point was made that these
changes the
president wants to make are not
going to happen

13:00.179 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immediately.

13:02.015 --> 13:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to take months, even
years to really
largely or completely undo the
clean energy

13:08.688 --> 13:11.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moves by the Obama
administration.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How long do you think it will
take for this
to take effect?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I think the
impact in
terms of the optimism that
result of what

13:18.297 --> 13:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president did today is going
to be immediate,
because what we know is the
regulations by

13:22.235 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration, they
have been very
expensive, time-consuming,
burdensome.

13:27.240 --> 13:33.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to know that that relief is
coming and
those very expensive regulations
have been

13:33.179 --> 13:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lifted is going to be, I think,
really a good
thing, and people are going to
feel that.

13:37.283 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you take a look at what's
happened with
this decision today, it's this
giant step

13:43.556 --> 13:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward and we're basically just
try to get
back into balance.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We all want a clean environment.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to make energy as clean
as we can
as fast as we can in ways that
don't raise

13:52.665 --> 13:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cost for American families.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama's approach has
been to add
to the expense.

13:57.937 --> 14:02.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that President
Trump's approach
has been to add to our economic
freedom and

14:02.975 --> 14:04.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opportunity.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator John
Barrasso of Wyoming,
we thank you very much.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:08.881 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO: Thanks, Judy.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now let's
hear from the
prior administrator of the EPA,
who essentially

14:14.554 --> 14:18.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
led much of President Obama's
efforts during
his second term.

14:18.524 --> 14:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gina McCarthy is now a fellow at
the Institute
of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy
School of

14:23.663 --> 14:24.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Government.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She first shared her reaction to
the announcement.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GINA MCCARTHY, Former
Administrator, Environmental
Protection Agency: Well, it's
great to be

14:28.735 --> 14:30.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here with you, Judy.

14:30.636 --> 14:35.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my reaction is that it's
pretty disappointing
and a little bit embarrassing to
have signed

14:35.174 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that executive order.

14:36.943 --> 14:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a lot of time in
between here
and actually undoing the legacy
of President

14:42.615 --> 14:44.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obama on this.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want people to understand
that reality,
in terms of where we're going,
it's going

14:47.420 --> 14:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a difficult slog for this
administration
to undo the great work that we
did the prior

14:51.991 --> 14:53.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eight years.

14:53.860 --> 14:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, President
Trump is saying
this is all about bolstering the
energy industry,

14:57.930 --> 15:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bringing jobs back that he
issued have been
decimated by the unnecessary
rules and regulations

15:04.637 --> 15:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and restrictions during the
Obama administration.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: Well, Judy, we
have heard that
tired story for a really long
time.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that, since EPA has
been around,
we have reduced air pollution 70
percent,

15:16.849 --> 15:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while we tripled the GDP.

15:18.651 --> 15:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think nobody in this
country is really
willing to go back to a time
when the air

15:23.322 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was polluted and the water was
polluted.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we don't have to for jobs.

15:27.894 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We certainly know that,
particularly when
it comes to clean energy.

15:32.231 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is that clean energy
is fiscally
responsible today.

15:36.335 --> 15:40.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's being chosen by many states
and utilities
and mayors.

15:40.339 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Already, that is where the
investment is heading.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's where jobs are.

15:45.077 --> 15:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the solar industry
is growing
12 times faster than the overall
economy.

15:49.882 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you really want to do
something for
the business community and for
jobs, why aren't

15:55.855 --> 15:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you investing in clean energy
and doubling
down on what we proposed?

15:59.225 --> 16:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how does
that square,
though, Gina McCarthy, with what
President

16:03.396 --> 16:05.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump is saying?

16:05.364 --> 16:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is saying what has happened
with this so-called
Clean Power Plan that you and
President Obama

16:10.369 --> 16:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped to institute is that jobs
that have
been lost.

16:13.739 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's talking -- he said --
at one point,
he said today no single
regulation has threatened

16:18.411 --> 16:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
miners more than that one.

16:20.746 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: Well, I think he
has to look
at the history of the coal
mining industry,

16:26.018 --> 16:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not try to produce rhetoric
that gives
them comfort.

16:29.856 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they really need is support
in the transition
that's already happening, with
or without

16:34.493 --> 16:36.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Clean Power Plan.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that the industry has
been struggling
for awhile.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The simple fact is that it's not
competitive
now.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's why it's not successful
in the market.

16:45.438 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why you see companies,
mining companies
going out of business.

16:49.041 --> 16:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's time to get real with
those people
and offer them support they
need, but not

16:54.280 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply say that climate change
isn't happening
or that EPA is taking away those
jobs.

16:59.619 --> 17:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, let's look at the
popularity of this
proposal when it goes out.

17:04.557 --> 17:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that 70 percent of the
people in this
country understand that the
climate has changed,

17:10.930 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they are looking forward to
us regulating
utilities to make sure they're
not polluting.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is certainly a
significant number.

17:20.773 --> 17:24.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In fact, it's twice the
popularity of this
president.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so let's look at how people
react to it.

17:27.346 --> 17:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people know that it's
all about the
future, not about looking at the
past, where

17:33.052 --> 17:34.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have to go with jobs.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And none us want to leave any
community behind.

17:37.690 --> 17:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're not going to do it by
sending signals
that are simply a signature on a
page.

17:42.662 --> 17:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a huge amount of work
between what
we did to build our clean energy
future and

17:49.769 --> 17:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it's going to take to
actually meet the
promises of this executive
order.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's lots of hard work, many
years.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's denying the science.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's developing facts that don't
exist.

18:02.014 --> 18:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm pretty confident
that, despite
this signature, the Obama legacy
on clean

18:07.620 --> 18:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy will be strong at the end
this and
any administration, because
that's where the

18:12.725 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world is going.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where U.S. strengths
should be.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where we should be
investing and innovating.

18:18.864 --> 18:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
many lawsuits,
Gina McCarthy, that have been
filed by different

18:23.336 --> 18:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states against the EPA, against
you, the president,
when you and President Obama
were in office?

18:30.676 --> 18:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The argument is made that that
says that you
just -- for all the good
intention, that you

18:36.415 --> 18:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't fully appreciate the
impact that these
restrictions would have on real
people, real

18:42.421 --> 18:44.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lives, real jobs?

18:44.123 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: Well, I think the
thing we
need to point to, again, is,
what is reality

18:47.693 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

18:49.528 --> 18:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that many of the states
that sued EPA
saying that these levels were
unrealistic

18:53.632 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to achieve are already achieving
the reductions
that we were going to require in
2022.

18:59.205 --> 19:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are achieving them
today, because
we did a very good job of
outreach in understanding

19:06.445 --> 19:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and educating ourselves about
the energy transition
that was already happening.

19:12.351 --> 19:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We knew that renewables were
getting competitive
in many states.

19:16.088 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We knew that energy efficiency
was available
and opportunities to reduce
energy demand.

19:22.028 --> 19:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also knew that inexpensive
natural gas
was continuing to compete
against coal, and

19:28.434 --> 19:29.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
compete successfully.

19:29.702 --> 19:33.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we never expected this to be
the complete
answer, Judy.

19:33.706 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We never pushed it beyond where
we thought
the energy world was heading.

19:37.777 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And right now, as I said, you
are seeing states
achieving levels in 2022.

19:43.149 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How bad could our rule have
been, how unreasonable
could anyone think that is, when
we are already

19:50.723 --> 19:53.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there in so many states?

19:53.426 --> 19:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The simple fact is that many
states sued us,
again, as a symbolic gesture.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what you need to look at is,
where are
utilities spending their money?

20:01.600 --> 20:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is fiscally responsible
now?

20:04.303 --> 20:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's available to them?

20:05.604 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they already doing?

20:07.373 --> 20:12.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at it in
reality, you will
see that they're investing in a
low-carbon

20:12.645 --> 20:14.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
future already.

20:14.413 --> 20:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we really need to do is
continue
to provide opportunities for
lower-cost, clean

20:19.718 --> 20:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy moving forward, and we
will meet our
obligation to our kids' future
to address

20:25.758 --> 20:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the challenge of climate change
in a way that
will keep our energy sector
strong and reliable.

20:31.697 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gina McCarthy,
who is the former
administrator of the
Environmental Protection

20:37.369 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Agency, thank you very much.

20:40.005 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: Thanks, Judy.

20:47.780 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
Capitol Hill,
where last week's collapse of
the effort to

20:55.354 --> 21:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeal Obamacare and ongoing
drama over the
investigation into Russian
connections with

21:01.527 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump campaign have dealt a
blow to the
majority party.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins reports.

21:07.433 --> 21:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In Congress,
another tumultuous
day, with more questions for
Republicans than

21:15.908 --> 21:16.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
answers.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES (R), California: You
guys get
so many opportunities to
interview me, whenever

21:19.311 --> 21:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there is something to report.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In particular,
for House
Intelligence Chairman Devin
Nunes.

21:23.549 --> 21:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His Democratic counterpart on
the committee,
Adam Schiff, has now publicly
called for Nunes

21:28.320 --> 21:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recuse himself from the
investigation into
Russia and possible ties to the
Trump campaign.

21:34.693 --> 21:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nunes sidestepped the question
today, implying
he will stay.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Are you considering
stepping down?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: Look guys, go ask
-- I mean,
I have no idea what they're even
talking about.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, go ask, go ask the other
side.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So, does that say
you're not considering
any change, not stepping down?

21:49.708 --> 21:50.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:50.709 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: What's the purpose?

21:51.777 --> 21:53.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, I'm -- I don't
understand your question.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This after
Nunes told the
White House, before telling
others in Congress,

21:55.948 --> 22:01.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that U.S. intelligence agencies
inadvertently
spied on people close to the
president.

22:01.387 --> 22:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then today, in The Washington
Post, allegations
that the White House tried to
block former

22:06.592 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Acting Attorney General Sally
Yates from talking
to Nunes' committee about
Russia.

22:11.964 --> 22:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Post pointed to a Justice
Department letter
written late last week telling
Yates her testimony

22:17.336 --> 22:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be privileged and the
White House should
decide if she could testify.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House insisted it
never blocked
her.

22:23.909 --> 22:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We have no problem with her
testifying, plain

22:27.079 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and simple.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report in The Washington
Post is 100 percent
false.

22:30.583 --> 22:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Yates has
not testified
yet because Nunes canceled the
hearing, saying

22:35.521 --> 22:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he needs more background.

22:37.323 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, late today, Nunes said he
will not tell
others on the Intelligence
Committee where

22:42.394 --> 22:44.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he got his information.

22:45.030 --> 22:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan was
asked today if
Nunes should step aside and if
he knew Nunes'

22:50.936 --> 22:51.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence source.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:53.038 --> 22:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: No,
and no.

22:53.939 --> 22:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others were
less sure.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate Republican Lindsey
Graham:

22:56.242 --> 22:58.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: If he
is not willing to tell the
Democrats and Republicans

22:59.878 --> 23:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the committee who he met with
and what
he was told, then I think he
lost his ability

23:04.516 --> 23:06.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to lead.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today was also
Republicans'
first day back since the
dramatic failure

23:09.088 --> 23:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pass their health care bill
and their decision
to move on to other issues.

23:13.459 --> 23:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was Friday, but, today, a
reversal.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House Republicans said health
care reform
is no longer dead.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MO BROOKS (R), Alabama: The
message is, we
are going to revisit health
care.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
QUESTION: When?

23:23.569 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO BROOKS: I got the impression
that it was
fairly immediate.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That from those
in the conservative

REP.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK MEADOWS (R), North
Carolina: Well, it's
too early to tell.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, I mean, obviously,
everybody wants to
find a way to get this passed.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to work real
hard to do that.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And from other
conservatives
outside the group.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY LOUDERMILK (R), Georgia:
The American
people want it done.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We want it done.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The game didn't end on Friday.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We just took a halftime.

23:49.361 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: An abundance of
intention,
with an absence of specifics.

23:54.366 --> 24:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker Ryan said Obamacare
cannot stay as
it is, but, as for exactly how
Republicans

24:00.105 --> 24:01.073 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that:

24:01.106 --> 24:02.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

24:02.841 --> 24:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I'm not going to put
a timeline
on it, because this is too
important to not

24:05.678 --> 24:07.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
get right and to put an
artificial timeline
on it.

24:08.013 --> 24:12.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ryan
acknowledged timing
does matter in one way, that
insurers will

24:12.351 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to make decisions soon.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us
now from
the Capitol.

24:17.690 --> 24:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, let's bore in a little
on this change
of heart about whether they're
going to go

24:22.161 --> 24:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back to health care or not.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president and others were
saying Friday
no.

24:26.532 --> 24:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it sounds like, as you
reported, they
are saying, we are going to move
ahead.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is everybody on board, all the
Republicans
on board with this?

24:33.405 --> 24:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They came out
of an extraordinary
conference meeting today, Judy,
all sounding

24:38.410 --> 24:39.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very unified.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the issue is, there aren't
specifics,
there's not a plan.

24:43.949 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a side issue, Judy, is some
Republicans
insist that this future health
care motion,

24:49.955 --> 24:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever it becomes, should be
Republican-only.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others, the moderates, want to
work with Democrats.

24:55.861 --> 24:58.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to craft a compromise
bill across
the aisle.

24:58.597 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we heard President Trump and
saw him tweet
about reaching out to Democrats
over the weekend.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have not figured out what
they want to
do.

25:05.871 --> 25:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, Judy, I can't stress
enough how raw
the emotions are for Republicans
here on the

25:10.042 --> 25:11.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hill today.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a group that used to
be the vote
counting group.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They used to operate in
tangibles.

25:16.281 --> 25:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now they're talking about
intangibles
like hope and promises, and they
don't yet

25:21.053 --> 25:22.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a plan.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, so, quickly,
Lisa, what
does the calendar look like?

25:24.323 --> 25:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does it look like they can
realistically
do?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, if
they're going to
tackle tax reform, they have got
to get right

25:29.027 --> 25:32.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to it, because they want to try
and get that
done before the August recess.

25:33.031 --> 25:37.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that could be very
complicated, even more
complicated now, given the
dynamics after

25:37.503 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the health care lack of a vote.

25:39.838 --> 25:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, actually, in just one
month, we
have got a major deadline.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's for government funding,
April 28.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And talking to Republicans
today, they admit
they need Democrats' help on
that.

25:49.715 --> 25:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa
Desjardins
at the Capitol, thank you.

25:59.758 --> 26:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa
Desjardins
at the Capitol, thank you.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

26:06.932 --> 26:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": The
Supreme Court
weighs in on how schools educate
students

26:11.203 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with disabilities; and Turkey
becoming more
hostile to Syrian refugees.

26:18.210 --> 26:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President Trump today
faced questions
from both parties over who will
pay for his

26:23.482 --> 26:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
promised wall on the U.S.-
Mexico border.

26:26.718 --> 26:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's already pledged to hire
thousands of
new immigration agents, whose
jurisdiction

26:32.057 --> 26:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extends deep into the U.S.
itself.

26:34.726 --> 26:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Americans on the Southern
border, interactions
with Border Patrol vary.

26:39.898 --> 26:44.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some see an occasional
inconvenience, others
a daily torment.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has story.

26:46.004 --> 26:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLOTTA WRAY, Arizona: Right
now, it looks
more like a war zone.

26:50.275 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Carlotta
Wray's commute
has changed a lot over the past
few years.

26:56.048 --> 27:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She lives in Arivaca, a sleepy,
no-stoplight
town 25 miles from the
Arizona-Mexico border.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You drive in any direction from
here, you
will pass surveillance towers
and border agents

27:07.926 --> 27:10.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on patrol.

27:10.195 --> 27:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Checkpoints run by Customs and
Border Protection,
CBP, stop traffic in either
direction out

27:15.901 --> 27:17.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of town.

27:18.003 --> 27:25.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARLOTTA WRAY: When the
checkpoint was only
temporary, I thought it wasn't a
big deal,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
until it got serious.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They never left.

27:29.314 --> 27:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Welcome to
life along the
U.S.-Mexico border, where
security has been

27:34.553 --> 27:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ramped up significantly since
9/11.

27:37.189 --> 27:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response to drug trafficking
and illegal
immigration, as well as fears of
terror, the

27:41.994 --> 27:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal government has hired
more agents and
installed more checkpoints.

27:46.031 --> 27:51.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But Border Patrols
infrastructure extends
well into the U.S. itself.

27:51.703 --> 27:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it often sweeps up American
citizens,
regardless of whether they have
crossed any

27:56.575 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
international boundary.

27:58.277 --> 28:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Research has shown that four out
of five drug
arrests by Border Patrol
actually involve

28:03.715 --> 28:04.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. nationals.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not just drug arrests.

28:07.052 --> 28:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Residents like Carlotta Wray,
who's an American
citizen born in Mexico, say they
are frequently

28:11.490 --> 28:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stopped and harassed, especially
because of
their skin color.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARLOTTA WRAY: You can see it.

28:16.828 --> 28:17.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You can feel it.

28:17.863 --> 28:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is racial profiling, no
doubt.

28:21.600 --> 28:27.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: CBP doesn't
release information
about the number of checkpoint
stops it makes.

28:27.739 --> 28:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Wray's troubles go beyond
the profiling,
to what she says is the broader
militarization

28:33.145 --> 28:34.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of her whole community.

28:35.013 --> 28:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOTTA WRAY: I have seen
Border Patrol agents
in my backyard running after
something with

28:40.819 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their pistols in their hands or
guns.

28:45.324 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's not what I want my
property for.

28:49.628 --> 28:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want it for my kids, my
grandkids to be
safe there.

28:53.231 --> 28:58.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In all these years that I live
in this town,
I have never been afraid of
anyone that walks

28:58.503 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the desert and stopped
at my place,
because he needs help or he just
needs water

29:05.210 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and food.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I have been afraid of the
Border Patrol.

29:09.581 --> 29:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: America's
Border Patrol
agency was created in 1924 to be
responsible

29:14.953 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for securing U.S. borders
between points of
entry.

29:18.624 --> 29:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But its jurisdiction actually
extends far
into the country itself, up to
100 miles from

29:24.162 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the border.

29:25.964 --> 29:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within that zone, its agents can
stop, detain
and search any person if an
agent suspects

29:31.703 --> 29:33.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a crime is being committed.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About two-thirds of Americans
live under Border
Patrol's authority.

29:36.842 --> 29:41.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in practice, it's the
people along the
border who are impacted most
directly.

29:41.179 --> 29:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICENTE PACO, Spokesman, Border
Patrol: Every
major route of egress into the
United States

29:44.750 --> 29:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along the border is going to
have one of those
checkpoints.

29:46.852 --> 29:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Border Patrol
spokesman
Vicente Paco grew up in a border
town himself.

29:51.356 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He took us on a tour of the
border near Nogales,
Arizona.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would you say to people in
these neighboring
communities who appreciate what
your mission

29:59.431 --> 30:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is and the job you're tasked
with, but they
still say that the impact on
their community

30:04.202 --> 30:05.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is too much?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICENTE PACO: I like to say that
I'm a community
member myself.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I grew up in a border town.

30:09.441 --> 30:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I saw how illegal activity
affects people
that I went to high school with.

30:16.348 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People that I grew up with ended
up in jail
because they were recruited by
transnational

30:20.819 --> 30:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criminal organizations to bring
illicit cargo
across the border.

30:24.156 --> 30:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT RAFTERY, Rancher: The
border check stations
can be bothersome if you have to
drive through

30:28.660 --> 30:30.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them every day.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They stop you, they hold you up
for a little
bit.

30:33.498 --> 30:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, overall, they're a
necessary
evil.

30:37.069 --> 30:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Scott Raftery
is a rancher
and horse trainer near Arivaca.

30:41.406 --> 30:46.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says he's recovered a
half-dozen dead bodies
from the land he works.

30:46.278 --> 30:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He once came home to an armed
standoff between
border agents and border
crossers on his own

30:51.483 --> 30:53.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
property.

30:53.218 --> 30:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT RAFTERY: There's people
out there crossing
our borders undetected,
unstopped.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, somewhere, we have to hold
the line on
them.

30:59.991 --> 31:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it's not at the border,
it's somewhere
close to border, because, once
they get north

31:05.864 --> 31:07.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of here, they're gone.

31:07.632 --> 31:12.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Three hundred
miles away
in Yuma, Arizona, Sheriff Leon
Wilmot also

31:12.537 --> 31:14.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supports stronger security.

31:14.673 --> 31:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The former Marine has spent 32
years in the
sheriff's department, and today
works closely

31:19.578 --> 31:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with federal agencies like
Customs and Border
Protection, Immigration, Drug
Enforcement,

31:24.950 --> 31:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even the FBI, all to fight crime
in his city
of 90,000 residents.

31:30.622 --> 31:35.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He says the hassle of
checkpoints and an increased
police presence is a small price
to pay to

31:35.794 --> 31:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect residents' safety.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEON WILMOT, Yuma County
Sheriff: If you live
on the border, you have to
understand that

31:40.699 --> 31:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're going to have to deal
with one issue
or the other.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Which one makes more sense?

31:46.438 --> 31:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Public safety, to me, is the
government's
priority.

31:49.508 --> 31:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, that's a no-brainer, or
if it's going
to prevent somebody from being
the victim

31:54.279 --> 31:55.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a homicide.

31:56.014 --> 32:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can do something to deter
folks from
dying and keep those illegal
drugs out of

32:01.186 --> 32:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our country, to me, that makes
sense.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And for those
caught in
the dragnet?

32:05.023 --> 32:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON WILMOT: If you're abiding
by the law,
then you have nothing to worry
about.

32:09.394 --> 32:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you got a ticket, that's
because you broke
the law.

32:12.631 --> 32:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But it's not
so easy for
Esteban Duarte.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He lives in Yuma with his kids,
and he's a
substance abuse counselor.

32:20.505 --> 32:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, every time he goes
through a checkpoint,
he ends up in what's called
secondary, where

32:25.644 --> 32:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're subject to being held and
searched.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ESTEBAN DUARTE, Substance Abuse
Counselor:
They do ask me for documents.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They keep me sitting in a room
for a while.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they just -- sometimes,
they're really
rude.

32:34.219 --> 32:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tell you to open your car,
run you like
a little dog.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Either you sit, or I'm going to
smack you.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Richard Edgar,
who is a
defense attorney in Yuma, sees
this frequently.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD EDGAR, Defense Attorney:
You talk
to a federal agent 100 percent
of the time

32:49.901 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when you want to leave Yuma
County.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to be talking to
him, answering
questions about your
citizenship.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to be answering
questions about
where you're going.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have the authority at any
point in time
to put you into secondary.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in secondary, that's where
they really
get into it.

33:02.781 --> 33:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Edgar says 80
percent of
his cases are drug-related
offenses from the

33:06.818 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearby checkpoints.

33:08.653 --> 33:13.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 2013 report by the Center for
Investigative
Reporting found that Border
Patrol around

33:13.758 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yuma had some of the highest
rates of arrests,
not for human trafficking or
immigration violations,

33:19.664 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but for possession of small
amounts of marijuana.

33:22.033 --> 33:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD EDGAR: But if you drive
by those checkpoints
as many times as somebody down
here does,

33:26.271 --> 33:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're going to see cars on the
side in secondary
being ripped apart.

33:30.442 --> 33:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if they find drugs in 10
percent of those,
is it worth it?

33:34.779 --> 33:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Esteban Duarte
isn't sure.

33:38.083 --> 33:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says of course he wants his
community and
his kids to be safe from crime.

33:42.587 --> 33:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he worries that the hand of
Border Patrol
comes down too hard.

33:46.491 --> 33:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESTEBAN DUARTE: From a father's
perspective,
I don't want anything going on,
on the streets

33:51.730 --> 33:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's going to harm my family.

33:55.133 --> 34:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
, But on the other point of
view, I could
look at it as, why did they
label me for?

34:02.841 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Americans
living along the
border will likely experience
even more scrutiny,

34:08.480 --> 34:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the Trump administration
orders an additional
5,000 Border Patrol agents.

34:13.785 --> 34:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm
William Brangham
in Yuma, Arizona.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have more
from our trip
to the border online.

34:21.826 --> 34:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visit a soup kitchen for
recently deported
migrants in Mexico near Nogales,
Arizona,

34:28.199 --> 34:33.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we talked to a husband and
father who
has tried to cross the border
into the U.S.

34:33.071 --> 34:38.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
several times.

34:38.276 --> 34:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: a Supreme Court ruling that
could have
a significant impact on special
education

34:47.919 --> 34:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in schools around the U.S.

34:50.388 --> 34:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang is back with that
story for our
weekly education segment, Making
the Grade.

34:55.393 --> 35:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amid all of the big
news last week,
this stunning ruling may have
been overlooked.

35:01.132 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court unanimously ruled that
schools must
give students with disabilities
the chance

35:05.503 --> 35:09.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to make meaningful and
appropriately ambitious
progress.

35:09.874 --> 35:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could set the bar higher
for more than
six million students nationwide.

35:14.579 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Stark of our partner
Education Week has
been covering this story and
joins me now.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, thanks for being here.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK, Education Week:
Thanks, John.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What was this case
about?

35:22.821 --> 35:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Well, the heart of
this case is
really, what educational benefit
do schools

35:26.992 --> 35:29.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need to provide to these
students.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a case out of Colorado,
involved a boy
named Drew.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He has autism.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The case was filed when he was
10.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's now 17.

35:37.235 --> 35:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His parents pulled him out of
the fourth grade
in the Douglas County Public
Schools -- that's

35:40.739 --> 35:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right outside Denver -- because
they were
concerned.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His behavior was deteriorating.

35:45.844 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they also felt that he
wasn't really getting
any educational benefit, as
required by law.

35:51.249 --> 35:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They put him in a private school
for autistic
kids, and then they sued the
district.

35:54.853 --> 35:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, look, if you're
not providing
the appropriate education, you
need to pay

35:58.823 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for this private school.

36:00.125 --> 36:03.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the lower courts all ruled
against the
family.

36:03.228 --> 36:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the 10th Circuit
ruled, the
appeals court ruled that that
school district

36:08.333 --> 36:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only had to provide something
that was merely
more than de minimis, in other
words, a very

36:13.104 --> 36:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trivial benefit to the child.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court, as you
indicated, totally
rejected that.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a unanimous decision.

36:20.478 --> 36:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court ruled 8-0 that, in
fact, education
programs must be appropriately
ambitious,

36:26.151 --> 36:29.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in light of each child's
circumstance, and
they must be challenged.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The kids have to have
challenging objectives.

36:31.322 --> 36:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, what does that
mean for the
classroom?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Depends on the
student.

36:35.727 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a student who is in a
regular classroom,
maybe you have ADHD, you have a
minor learning

36:40.932 --> 36:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disability, you're with every
other student,
it means that you need the
supports to be

36:44.436 --> 36:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to pass that classroom,
that classroom
and that grade, and move on with
your fellow

36:49.374 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
students.

36:51.276 --> 36:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are a more challenged
student, like
Drew, who has autism, and might
be in a special-ed

36:55.013 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class, well, then that program
is tailored
to what you can accomplish.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, as you say, it must
be meaningful
progress, challenging progress.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And what are
disability advocates
saying about this ruling?

37:05.690 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Well, they are
applauding this.

37:07.525 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see it as a big win for
disability, for
these kids, these nearly seven
million kids,

37:12.730 --> 37:14.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as you said.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They do think it's a
game-changer, that it
raises the bar.

37:17.268 --> 37:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney for the family,
Jack Robinson,
told me that, for the first
time, there's

37:21.239 --> 37:26.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a national standard that
determines really
what is the educational benefit
these kids

37:26.678 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
need?

37:28.446 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And drew's mom, Jennifer, she
told me that
she hopes school districts will
work more

37:31.416 --> 37:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closely now with parents, will
be more willing
to do something that is right
for their children.

37:36.888 --> 37:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, we should say that these
advocates think
this is just going to empower
parents, that

37:41.159 --> 37:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it gives them more leverage to
demand more
from school districts.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How are the districts
reacting?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Well, they say this
isn't a game-changer.

37:48.399 --> 37:53.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They believe that most districts
are already
providing a very good education
for these

37:53.705 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
students with disabilities.

37:55.006 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say that they meet this
higher standard.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I did talk to Sue Pudelski.

38:00.178 --> 38:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she is with the School
Superintendents
Association.

38:04.482 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She did tell me that this may
hold districts'
feet to the fire a little bit
more, that they're

38:08.887 --> 38:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have to justify these
plans they
set out for all of these
students, what is

38:13.224 --> 38:15.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called an IEP.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, so that may give
parents a little
wherewithal to come in and say,
what's this

38:19.197 --> 38:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
program and how is it working?

38:20.999 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And for parents of
children like
Drew, with this ruling, what do
they need

38:25.670 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to know?

38:27.605 --> 38:30.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Well, as I
mentioned, every district
needs to set up what is called
an IEP -- it's

38:30.108 --> 38:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an individualized education
program -- for
each of these students.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And parents have to sign off on
this.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, that's happening
right now.

38:37.815 --> 38:41.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is sort of fortuitous
timing, if
you will, because these are set
up in the

38:41.286 --> 38:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spring for the next school year.

38:43.488 --> 38:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents have always been told,
pay careful
attention, see what the district
is going

38:47.325 --> 38:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, ask a lot of questions,
find out what
resources you're getting.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they can also walk in with
this Supreme
Court decision and say, hey,
here are the

38:54.933 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standards that you need to meet
for my child.

38:56.768 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Stark of
Education Week, great
to see you again.

39:02.674 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: It was on a visit
to the huge
refugee camp at Zaatari in
Jordan today that

39:17.288 --> 39:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres called
for more international support
for Syrian

39:23.761 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees and for the countries
hosting them.

39:26.331 --> 39:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the north of Syria, Turkey
now hosts 3.5
million Syrian refugees.

39:32.437 --> 39:38.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Erdogan there says
70,000 people
with special talents will be
granted citizenship.

39:38.843 --> 39:44.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a Turkish charity is urging
the government
to grant citizenship to all
refugees, to stop

39:44.282 --> 39:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exploitation, and to prevent
violence erupting
between Turks and Syrians.

39:50.021 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Western Turkey.

39:54.092 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Hajeeras
from Northeastern
Syria are creating a new shelter
after being

39:59.731 --> 40:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evicted from their tent by
paramilitary police.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They live with the constant
worry of being
moved on again.

40:06.471 --> 40:12.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Aid workers say raids on
unofficial refugee
camps are part of the strategy
to stop migrants

40:12.443 --> 40:14.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from reaching Europe.

40:14.879 --> 40:20.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In an attempt to avoid
discovery, these people
are staying out of sight in
semi-derelict

40:20.084 --> 40:22.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
farm buildings.

40:22.787 --> 40:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This rough farmland was home to
about 300
refugees for the winter.

40:26.691 --> 40:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Syrians were cleared out
and told
to find accommodation in hotels,
houses or

40:32.363 --> 40:34.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
apartments.

40:34.165 --> 40:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The farmer objected to us
filming, called
the police, and followed us for
several miles

40:38.336 --> 40:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as we looked for people willing
to talk.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIAM IBRAHIM, Syrian Refugee
(through translator):
Mariam is my name, Mariam.

40:44.909 --> 40:48.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm 30 years old, Mariam
Ibrahim.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our life is awful.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have no source of income.

40:51.883 --> 40:52.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Only God is by our side.

40:54.719 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have no money.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are on our knees.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're struggling to survive.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We just work to live.

41:00.692 --> 41:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The landowner
is charging
Mariam $100 a month to pitch her
tent.

41:04.862 --> 41:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is alone with her five
children and has
little choice.

41:08.399 --> 41:12.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARIAM IBRAHIM (through
translator): They
say living in houses is better
for you than

41:12.437 --> 41:13.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
living in tents.

41:13.671 --> 41:14.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how do we feel?

41:14.906 --> 41:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, we are crammed on top of
one another.

41:17.241 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have the means or help
or money to
live in a house.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite barely
earning enough
to support her family, Mariam is
trying to

41:24.882 --> 41:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send money to Syria for her sick
husband left
behind in an area where Kurdish
forces are

41:30.555 --> 41:34.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fighting Islamic State.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's irregular work in the
fields around
the town of Torbila (ph).

41:36.961 --> 41:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here, they're harvesting leeks.

41:39.030 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Syrians say adults might get
$10 for a
12- to 14-hour day.

41:44.435 --> 41:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's about half the statutory
Turkish minimum
wage.

41:48.473 --> 41:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The children earn far less.

41:50.341 --> 41:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY (through translator): In
Syria, they are
all dead or living with death.

41:54.579 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY (through translator): We are
better off
in Turkey compared to Syria.

41:58.816 --> 41:59.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no fighting.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are comfortable here.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED MOHAMMED KHALAF, Syrian
Refugee (through
translator): I came to Turkey to
work in the

42:03.721 --> 42:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
orange orchards or flower
fields.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The daily pay is low, like 75
cents.

42:08.726 --> 42:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOY (through translator): Now we
are working
and coming back from rock
bottom.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think of being in school
and learning
everything.

42:15.867 --> 42:20.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Refugee
supporters say stories
like this are replicated all
along Turkey's

42:20.538 --> 42:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aegean Coast, the gateway to the
Greek Islands.

42:24.008 --> 42:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The three million Syrians
sheltering in Turkey
are inhabiting a precarious
twilight world

42:29.447 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they have no real access
to state services
and are treated like
second-class citizens.

42:34.385 --> 42:40.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may be safe from war, but
they and their
children are exploited and
vulnerable.

42:40.291 --> 42:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Little wonder that so many of
them wish to
cross this sea to Europe for a
better life.

42:46.831 --> 42:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In September 2015, Izmir was
smuggling central.

42:51.335 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This mosque was full of people
angling to
buy a passage to Europe.

42:55.006 --> 43:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after the E.U. signed a $3
billion deal
with Turkey to stem the migrant
flow, the

43:01.012 --> 43:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crowds have vanished from the
courtyard, and
also from this cafe, which was a
rendezvous

43:06.050 --> 43:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for traffickers and their
clients.

43:07.718 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrians are doing what's
necessary to
survive on the wrong side of the
tracks.

43:14.192 --> 43:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of their children work in
leather or
textile sweatshops.

43:19.564 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These young Syrians were on a
lunch break
from a textile factory and would
only confirm

43:24.302 --> 43:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have been working for
years, despite
being underage.

43:27.438 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under new Turkish laws, Syrian
children with
identity papers are allowed to
attend state

43:33.878 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

43:35.646 --> 43:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But aid agencies estimate that
only 5,000
out of 22,000 eligible children
in the Izmir

43:40.685 --> 43:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
area have taken up that right.

43:42.553 --> 43:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The rest are believed to be
working.

43:45.156 --> 43:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mohammed Sali Ali founded a
charity to help
Syrian refugees.

43:48.993 --> 43:52.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED SALI ALI, Charity
Founder (through
translator): When the parents
fled Syrian,

43:52.663 --> 43:54.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they had some money in their
pockets.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, after a few months, they
ran out of money.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't have any income.

43:57.768 --> 43:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have any work or
trade.

43:59.337 --> 44:02.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they had to choose between
begging and
sending the kids to work.

44:02.607 --> 44:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Turkey is
hosting more refugees
than any other country.

44:06.811 --> 44:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aid agencies warn of growing
racial tension.

44:09.814 --> 44:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the back streets of
Izmir, there's
clear resentment from Turks
about the impact

44:14.018 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees have on the labor
market, at a time
when there's 12 percent
unemployment nationally,

44:19.423 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a seven-year high.

44:21.192 --> 44:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMER YESHIL, Turkey (through
translator):
The Turks should first think
about their own

44:24.662 --> 44:25.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

44:25.663 --> 44:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Retired people are starving.

44:26.697 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't even find work with the
minimum wage.

44:28.966 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We, as Turkish citizens, can
hardly make a
living.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you understand?

44:33.104 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are worse off than the
Syrians.

44:34.939 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADNAN KIRBY, Turkey (through
translator):
At the moment, because the
Syrians' employment

44:38.743 --> 44:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went down a lot, they work on
the cheap.

44:40.778 --> 44:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because they work for low
wages, the situation
for Turkish workers is bad now.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
are our guests
here.

44:48.786 --> 44:50.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why should we complain?

44:50.288 --> 44:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One day, when things are OK
again in their
own land, they will go back.

44:54.025 --> 44:58.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Zahir
Bhatah is planning
to stay, along with his
4-year-old autistic

44:58.996 --> 44:59.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
son, Anver.

44:59.997 --> 45:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't dare take a rubber
dingy to Greece.

45:02.767 --> 45:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZAHIR BHATAH, Syrian Refugee:
The sea is very
dangerous.

45:05.436 --> 45:07.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My son is very small.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he cannot swim.

45:09.373 --> 45:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have many friends who drowned
in the sea.

45:13.644 --> 45:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I am get so scared to travel
to Europe.

45:18.816 --> 45:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I decided to stay in Izmir.

45:22.987 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Bhatah used to
be a heart
surgeon in Damascus.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Izmir, he worked as a baker
for a while.

45:30.962 --> 45:34.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's applying for Turkish
citizenship under
President Erdogan's new
initiative.

45:34.765 --> 45:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHIR BHATAH: I think it's
better for me to
find a chance to work as a
doctor in Turkey.

45:43.574 --> 45:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Other refugees
are taking
Turkish lessons to improve their
chances of

45:49.146 --> 45:52.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assimilation and employment.

45:52.216 --> 45:56.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, at Ramadan, the
Turkish president
promised citizenship for all
refugees from

45:56.721 --> 46:01.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria and Iraq, but had to
retreat because
of widespread opposition.

46:01.559 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now an aid group called Bridging
People says
that Turks should remember what
happened to

46:06.364 --> 46:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds of thousands of theirs
countrymen
when they migrated to Germany
for work after

46:11.135 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Second World War.

46:12.803 --> 46:17.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burcu Senturk, a spokeswoman for
Bridging
People, argues that Turkey
should copy the

46:17.742 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Germans and grant the Syrians
citizenship.

BURCU SENTURK, Bridging People:
When they
come here, they are not
refugees.

46:23.047 --> 46:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are people with their
families and hopes.

46:25.349 --> 46:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in due time, they
will be settling
down in Turkey with their unique
stories and

46:30.187 --> 46:31.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unique qualifications.

46:31.589 --> 46:34.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is why we need to
embrace all of
them.

46:34.592 --> 46:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Senturk argues
that Turks
will benefit from such a
proposal.

46:38.262 --> 46:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BURCU SENTURK: I think that this
will protect
many Syrians and other nations'
refugees in

46:43.000 --> 46:45.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turkey if they become citizens.

46:45.236 --> 46:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since the Turkish workers
and the other
nationalities' workers will be
working in

46:50.541 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same conditions, it will
also decrease
the potential for racism and
violence between

46:56.514 --> 46:58.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the people.

46:58.249 --> 47:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: While the
president may be
sympathetic, campaigners say
they need to

47:01.152 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convince lawmakers from the
ruling party that
the alternative to citizenship
is potential

47:06.390 --> 47:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strife in the future from
stateless disenfranchised
people, especially the young,
like the 8-year-old

47:12.830 --> 47:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who says he was clawed by a
Turkish teacher.

47:17.401 --> 47:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Children selling tissues, the
underage fruit-picker
banned from playing soccer on a
farmer's land,

47:24.208 --> 47:26.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they face an uncertain future.

47:26.377 --> 47:32.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the heart surgeon is
optimistic that his
hosts will judge that his skills
are worth

47:32.550 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
harnessing and make him a Turk.

JEFFREY BROWN: February 20,
1862, 12-year
old Willie Lincoln has just died
of typhoid

48:01.412 --> 48:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and been interred at Oak Hills
Cemetery in
Washington, D.C.

48:05.416 --> 48:08.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His grieving father, the
president, visits
at night.

48:08.486 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So far, all true.

48:10.287 --> 48:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the new novel "Lincoln in
the Bardo,"
it's the cemetery's ghostly
inhabitants that

48:15.126 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell us of the visit and its
consequences.

48:17.895 --> 48:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first novel by
George Saunders,
widely acclaimed as a short
story writer,

48:22.299 --> 48:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including his most recent
collection, "Tenth
of December."

48:25.770 --> 48:26.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

48:26.771 --> 48:28.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nice to see you again.

48:28.472 --> 48:29.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SAUNDERS, Author,
"Lincoln in the Bardo":
Nice to be here, nice to be
here.

48:29.907 --> 48:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this is a
ghost story,
very human ghosts, right?

48:30.775 --> 48:32.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't even think they're
stuck.

48:32.910 --> 48:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't even know they're
stuck.

48:33.911 --> 48:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't even know they're
dead.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: They don't even
know yet.

48:36.714 --> 48:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, they're stuck, and they're
stuck kind
of in the condition they were in
at the moment

48:39.550 --> 48:41.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of death.

48:41.352 --> 48:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they were worried about
something or
feeling shortchanged or in love
or in hate,

48:45.756 --> 48:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they suddenly are in this other
place, and
desperately trying to stay
there, which they

48:50.027 --> 48:51.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do by repeating their
grievances.

48:51.428 --> 48:53.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which makes them
very, very
human, very, very alive.

48:53.731 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: They're just
neurotic and
free-floating, yes.

48:56.834 --> 49:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We should say the
bardo is
a Tibetan term for a transition?

49:00.504 --> 49:02.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Well, actually,
we're in
one now.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in the transition between
birth and
death.

49:04.208 --> 49:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the one that people often
know about is
the transition between the
moment of death

49:08.312 --> 49:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whatever comes next, so
reincarnation
or heaven or hell.

49:11.248 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this
particular bardo is
a cemetery, as I said, a real
one, not too

49:15.186 --> 49:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far from here in Washington,
D.C., right?

49:17.688 --> 49:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you tell the story through
voices, a chorus
of voices.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why that approach?

49:23.694 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: The first thing
I wanted
to not do was tell it in a way
that made death

49:28.465 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and this experience seem banal
or manageable.

49:31.502 --> 49:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my approach to fiction is to
kind of just
to go in there moment by moment
and try to

49:35.840 --> 49:37.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always make some sparks.

49:37.608 --> 49:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this case, it meant kind
of telling
it from a strange angle that
might even give

49:41.078 --> 49:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reader a little struggle in
the first
10 to 15 pages.

49:44.715 --> 49:48.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I thought, you know,
whatever happens
after this life, it would be
really strange

49:48.552 --> 49:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it was what we expected.

49:49.687 --> 49:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I wanted to kind of simulate
that in the
book.

49:51.822 --> 49:56.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the reader is a little
destabilized, the
ghosts are a little
destabilized, and I found

49:56.460 --> 49:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you could kind of do that
through the form
of the thing.

49:58.295 --> 50:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just to make it
clear to our
audience, there's no one
narrator.

50:01.365 --> 50:07.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's all of these voices which
you are assembling,
including snippets from and
quotations from

50:07.705 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real historians and some made-up
historians.

50:10.207 --> 50:12.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.

50:12.042 --> 50:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first heard the story
about Lincoln,
I -- it was so beautiful to me
and sorrowful

50:15.246 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gorgeous, that I -- my
mantra was kind
of just make the ending so --
make the book

50:21.151 --> 50:25.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so weird and beautiful, that it
would do some
justice to that emotional core.

50:25.456 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, along the way, that was a
great mantra
to kind of say, does this
decision lead to

50:29.393 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the direction of emotional power
or not?

50:31.962 --> 50:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the strange thing was,
following those
bread crumbs, I looked up about
a third of

50:35.766 --> 50:40.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way in, and it had this
crazy form, and
very fun and gratifying.

50:40.571 --> 50:45.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It raised the
question for
me just about, almost, what is a
novel?

50:45.109 --> 50:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Well, somebody
told me is
a novel is a long work of prose
that has something

50:48.178 --> 50:49.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong with it.

50:49.179 --> 50:50.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I think, by that...

50:50.714 --> 50:51.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:51.715 --> 50:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: ... standard,
it qualifies.

50:52.716 --> 50:53.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I never -- I wanted to write a
novel.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This particular material was so
insistent.

50:55.719 --> 50:59.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really kept a close eye on
it, like,
don't be a novel unless you have
to.

50:59.556 --> 51:02.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at some point, it really
convinced me
that it deserved the length.

51:02.860 --> 51:07.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And it makes me
wonder, did
you feel you had to sort of play
with the

51:07.865 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
form of a novel, or you -- you
just couldn't
write a straightforward
narrative?

51:11.101 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I couldn't
write a straightforward
narrative.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I couldn't write a brief
narrative.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, again, I would have.

51:17.141 --> 51:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been happy to do all of
that.

51:18.375 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's kind of strange.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My artistic approach is that
you're supposed
to be a little baffled as you're
writing.

51:23.747 --> 51:24.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

51:24.748 --> 51:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You, the writer?

51:25.749 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yes.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The holiest state is to be a
little confused
about what you're doing.

51:28.886 --> 51:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're guiding by the energy
that the
story is actually giving you as
you revise.

51:33.924 --> 51:38.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's kind of tricky, because
it means you
have to abandon your ideas about
organization

51:38.529 --> 51:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or thematics, and really submit
to the story,
just as if it was a friend kind
of trying

51:43.567 --> 51:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to convince you of something.

51:45.369 --> 51:49.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you do that, sometimes,
it takes you
-- it asks you to do really
crazy things.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, that's the thrill
of it, is to
say, OK, I will try it.

51:52.543 --> 51:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, hopefully, it will
result in some
kind of new mode of beauty.

51:55.379 --> 51:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, at some
point, you're
no longer confused by what
you're doing?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It never stops?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I'm still
confused, because,
hopefully, the book is doing
things that you

52:02.786 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't consciously plan.

52:04.555 --> 52:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, at the core
of this is
this figure, Abraham Lincoln,
probably the

52:09.493 --> 52:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most written of personage in
American history,
right?

52:13.597 --> 52:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You come at him through angles,
the voices
of the ghosts observing him, his
son, the

52:19.136 --> 52:20.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
historians.

52:20.671 --> 52:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was that because you couldn't
get a grasp
of him, or you didn't want to?

52:25.075 --> 52:26.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: It scared me to
try.

52:26.944 --> 52:31.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, I was a little bit
afraid of coming
with all that conventional
wisdom about him.

52:31.949 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at one point, I thought,
you know, actually,
I don't want to write a book
about Lincoln.

52:35.452 --> 52:39.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's -- I don't claim to know
him, but
I needed him, the father who's
so grief-stricken,

52:39.957 --> 52:41.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he goes to see his dead son's
body.

52:41.959 --> 52:46.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is Abraham
Lincoln at
a moment of tremendous personal
grief, but

52:46.330 --> 52:50.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also surrounded by the Civil War
and the grief
of so many who will die, right?

52:51.001 --> 52:51.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yes.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Right, right.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was actually a wonderful
chance to hang
out with him for four years.

52:55.539 --> 53:01.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see a president who really
made a virtue
