HARI SREENIVASAN: Now let's turn
to the extreme heat wave baking
the West and Southwest parts

00:03.966 --> 00:05.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Temperatures are well
above the 100-degree mark.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In California, it was 127
degrees yesterday in Death
Valley, 122 in Palm Springs.

00:14.666 --> 00:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Phoenix, the temperature
is expected to top out
at 118 degrees today.

00:18.433 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it's been so hot
there, more than 40 flights
were canceled or delayed because

00:24.600 --> 00:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some planes can't safely
lift off in that heat.

00:27.266 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new analysis published in the
journal "Nature Climate Change"
this week also said climate

00:33.700 --> 00:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change is leading to more
heat waves in general.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It found that 30 percent of the
world's population is exposed
to potentially deadly heat for

00:41.500 --> 00:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 days per year or more.

00:43.733 --> 00:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the subject of our weekly
segment on the Leading Edge
of science with Miles O'Brien.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's start with what's
happening in Phoenix.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles, you have flown
for a long time.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have always heard of
flights being delayed
because it's too cold.

00:55.466 --> 00:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can a flight not take
off because it's so hot?

00:57.633 --> 01:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, Hari, if
it weren't for the snow and
ice, the winter would be the

01:00.833 --> 01:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perfect time to fly, because
a wing achieves flight, it
derives lift based on the number

01:07.533 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of air molecules
that surround it.

01:09.766 --> 01:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as the temperature heat
up, those molecules command.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know that, when you
warm things up, things
expand generally.

01:16.966 --> 01:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So there are fewer
air molecules, so it
takes greater amount of
speed for that aircraft

01:21.800 --> 01:23.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to fly.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the runway isn't long
enough to support that -- in
other words, if the temperature

01:26.733 --> 01:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so high that there are so
few molecules there to lift
the wing that you don't have

01:30.966 --> 01:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough runway to get going
fast enough, you're grounded.

01:34.233 --> 01:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
so this is still smaller
planes that were affected.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the difference
with the bigger planes?

01:39.633 --> 01:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the larger
planes, the Boeing 737s, the
big airliners, are designed

01:43.900 --> 01:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to operate in a wider range of
circumstances, for one thing.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are kind of a global
product that has to operate in
all kinds of intense conditions.

01:51.666 --> 01:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, it just
costs more to certify
them to these parameters.

01:56.233 --> 02:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition, a 737, for example,
has a lot more potential
payload, so you can take off

02:02.366 --> 02:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some cargo and still
fly the mission.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These smaller planes
are not designed with
as much versatility, and
because they're smaller,

02:09.633 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have less capability
to reduce the payload
and thus take off.

02:13.900 --> 02:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really, ultimately, they
have charts in there that a
pilot has to look at, and there

02:18.066 --> 02:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be a maximum temperature,
given the altitude of
the field, et cetera.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if you exceed that, you
legally cannot take off.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
lots of runways that are too
short to deal with this kind

02:30.033 --> 02:32.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of heat.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we talked about in Phoenix,
but, say, a place like La
Guardia is just as confined

02:34.500 --> 02:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or San Francisco is
just constrained by a
certain amount of space.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, so
researchers looked at this.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The La Guardia runway is about
7,000 feet, runways there.

02:42.866 --> 02:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while that's about 20 feet
above sea level, and thus the
air is denser there, by virtue

02:49.833 --> 02:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of where it is and it doesn't
get quite as hot, nevertheless,
at that length, you still

02:56.333 --> 02:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - there are still some
parameters and constraints
that we have to be
watching as the climate

02:58.600 --> 03:00.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gets warmer.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This goes into the larger
subject, Hari, of how our
civilization is designed.

03:03.733 --> 03:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're thinking about a
beach house on a barrier island
or a runway at La Guardia

03:08.233 --> 03:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or at Phoenix Sky Harbor,
we have a finely-tuned
civilization, and as
the temperature goes

03:15.200 --> 03:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, even though it has only
gone up a degree Celsius over
a hundred years, it does create

03:19.233 --> 03:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pockets of these heat waves.

03:21.866 --> 03:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not exactly sure
why, probably because the
jet stream is weakening
and causing high-pressure

03:25.500 --> 03:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
systems to park in these places.

03:27.366 --> 03:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I spoke with a climate
scientist who has looked
into this extensively.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's at Columbia University --
Radley Horton is his name --
as part of a series I did for

03:36.333 --> 03:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the weather app MyRadar.

03:38.366 --> 03:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RADLEY HORTON, Columbia
University: If we look
at the last decade
or two, we are seeing

03:41.033 --> 03:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
twice as many record-breaking
extreme heat events, cities
that are breaking their daily

03:48.000 --> 03:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record highs for a given day,
compared to the ratio compared
to the number of cities

03:52.600 --> 03:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
having record-breaking
cold temperatures.

03:54.766 --> 03:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you make temperatures just
a couple degrees warmer on the
hottest days, that means much

03:59.000 --> 04:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more demand for air
conditioning, for
example, which means much
greater risk of the power

04:03.433 --> 04:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going out, precisely at those
temperatures, those times when
people are so sensitive to

04:09.833 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a little more warming from
a public health perspective.

04:12.533 --> 04:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That goes a
bit to that Goldilocks effect
you are talking about, because

04:15.566 --> 04:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even our infrastructure and
our systems are built for us
to be within a certain range.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

04:21.733 --> 04:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we need
to be really watching the
effects of climate change.

04:25.533 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's easy to dismiss
a one-degree Celsius
increase and say, well,
that's not a big deal,

04:30.500 --> 04:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, in isolated locations, in
specific locations, whether it's
Phoenix or whether it's Miami

04:37.433 --> 04:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beach or whether it's another
city that has a sea level
problem that it is dealing with,

04:43.200 --> 04:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether it's California
dealing with wildfires,
those particular pockets,
those problems are

04:46.400 --> 04:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exacerbated by that
overall increase in the
temperature of the climate,
the overall temperature

04:53.066 --> 04:55.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the planet.

04:55.133 --> 04:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it causes changes to our
weather systems which we're
just beginning to understand.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Researchers are just
getting a handle on it.

05:02.733 --> 05:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So in the
case of this news about Phoenix
and the air -- do airlines,

05:05.933 --> 05:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who think about buying planes
years and years out -- these are
hundreds of millions of dollars'

05:10.100 --> 05:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worth of purchases -- do they
think differently about what
kind of jets to buy or where to

05:13.933 --> 05:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
park all those jets, in a
place with a long runway?

05:16.433 --> 05:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hari, I
think this is something
the aviation industry
has not gotten out ahead

05:21.266 --> 05:23.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suspect there are a lot of
conversations going right now
as we have seen this record

05:26.233 --> 05:28.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heat wave.

05:28.266 --> 05:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a similar record
heat wave last year as well
which caused similar problems.

05:31.733 --> 05:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the airlines are going to
have to contend with this, the
airliner makers, and airports

05:37.500 --> 05:39.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

05:39.366 --> 05:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The longest runway at Phoenix
Sky Harbor is a little
more than 11,000 feet.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They might have to think
about extending that runway.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about La Guardia, though?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that even possible?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it possible to
even consider that?

05:48.766 --> 05:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All these things get factored
into the consequences
of climate change and
how we as civilization

05:53.833 --> 05:55.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can adapt to it.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
science correspondent Miles
O'Brien, thanks so much.

05:56.833 --> 05:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.
