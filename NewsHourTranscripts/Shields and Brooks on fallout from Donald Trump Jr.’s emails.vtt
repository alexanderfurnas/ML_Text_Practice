00:01.500 --> 00:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But first to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.533 --> 00:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:06.633 --> 00:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Mark, welcome back.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
missed you last week.

00:12.566 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Donald Trump Jr. story.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have now learned that he
had a meeting a year ago,
Trump Tower, with a lawyer who

00:20.366 --> 00:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had some connection to
the Russian government.

00:22.566 --> 00:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does this change our
understanding of the Russia
collusion allegation?

00:27.066 --> 00:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
it's fair to say, Judy, that
the White House lost any benefit

00:31.100 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the doubt that it
could claim on this story.

00:33.233 --> 00:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The shoes continue to drop,
like it's a Zappos warehouse
or Imelda Marcos' closet.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it just -- each time,
they're amending their story,
they're appending or extending

00:46.933 --> 00:49.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their story.

00:49.233 --> 00:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think the fact
that there were such denials
and accusations of a Democratic

00:56.266 --> 00:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plot, all of those are gone,
and they stand naked and
they stand exposed as shams.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they were actively
engaged, at least welcoming
Russian involvement in the 2016

01:09.433 --> 01:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, in behalf of Donald
Trump against Hillary Clinton.

01:13.133 --> 01:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, does
this change your assessment of
what may have been going on?

01:17.066 --> 01:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My colleague Ross Douthat wrote
that any time you give Donald
Trump the benefit of the doubt,

01:22.233 --> 01:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he always lets you down.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:24.500 --> 01:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that's true.

01:26.566 --> 01:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's true for his business
clients and it's true for those
of us who thought, they couldn't

01:29.700 --> 01:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been some stupid, to
walk right into collusion
with the Russian meetings.

01:34.533 --> 01:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet they were not only that
stupid, but I think what is
striking to me is the complete

01:38.733 --> 01:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amorality of it, that Donald
Trump Jr. gets an e-mail saying
the Russian government is

01:44.966 --> 01:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offering you this, and
he says, "I love it."

01:47.033 --> 01:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it reminded me so much
of some of the e-mails that
came out of the Jack Abramoff

01:50.066 --> 01:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scandal, that came out of the
financial crisis scandal, where
they're just -- they're like

01:54.066 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frat boys who are gleefully
going against the law and are
going against all morality.

02:00.466 --> 02:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're not even overcoming
any scruples to do this.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're just having fun with it.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, in the days since,
we have had on - - Donald Jr.
on Sean Hannity's show, again,

02:12.066 --> 02:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did nothing wrong, just
incapable of seeing that there
might have been something wrong

02:14.933 --> 02:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about colluding with a foreign
power who is hostile with you.

02:17.733 --> 02:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Donald Trump himself
saying, he's a wonderful guy,
again, not seeing anything

02:22.166 --> 02:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong, and then even last day
lying about how many people were
in the meeting, a completely

02:26.500 --> 02:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inconsequential lie.

02:28.566 --> 02:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're trapped in the
zone just beyond any ethical
scruple, where it's all about

02:33.233 --> 02:35.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winning.

02:35.233 --> 02:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beyond any
ethical scruple, Mark,
is that where we are?

02:37.833 --> 02:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I think
it's fair to say that
Donald Trump was born
without the embarrassment

02:43.433 --> 02:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gene or the moral
reservation gene.

02:45.466 --> 02:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He just -- he doesn't --
when he says that most people
would take that meeting, Judy,

02:49.733 --> 02:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is not -- I have
been around for a while, and
been to the Dallas Fair twice,

02:55.533 --> 02:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and all the rest of it.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People wouldn't do that.

02:59.966 --> 03:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2000, Al Gore's campaign
got ahold of, was delivered
George Bush's briefing book.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They turned it over to the FBI.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what you do when
you're honorable in politics.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't a meeting
with a foreign power.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't Canada or the
Swiss Family Robinson.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is Russia.

03:18.933 --> 03:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country that has
supported, propped up the worst
of anti-democratic regimes in

03:23.433 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East, that has
practiced -- mistreated
its own press, mistreated
its own civil society,

03:31.333 --> 03:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economic intimidation
of its neighbors, including
invasion of its neighbors.

03:38.266 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is the one country
on the face of the earth with
the capacity to obliterate

03:42.266 --> 03:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is serious stuff.

03:45.900 --> 03:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to do it so casually and,
as David said, without moral
reservation, is -- I guess it

03:53.766 --> 03:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be stunning,
but, sadly, it isn't.

03:55.900 --> 03:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But some of the
Trump team, David, in their
response to this are sounding

03:59.300 --> 04:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost offended that people
would even think that they
were doing something wrong.

04:03.133 --> 04:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, they
just don't -- they don't get it.

04:06.033 --> 04:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My pal Mike Gerson had a good
line in his column today.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you make losing a sin, you
make cheating a sacrament.

04:12.866 --> 04:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is true.

04:14.933 --> 04:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's all win-loss, then
you do whatever you can to win
and to make money and to beat

04:18.900 --> 04:20.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deal.

04:20.933 --> 04:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think you have
entered the zone where they
don't quite see what they have

04:23.133 --> 04:25.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done wrong.

04:25.166 --> 04:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But cheating with a foreign
company -- country is -- as Mark
keeps saying, is a grave sin.

04:31.633 --> 04:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's just the
scandal management of it, of
letting it drip out, letting it

04:37.800 --> 04:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drip out today and
today and today.

04:40.300 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there is almost just
a cluelessness like a color
blindness about how the rest

04:46.466 --> 04:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the world is going
to go react to this.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this has been a leitmotif
for the Trump administration.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the case,
Mark, that there was one version
we heard over the weekend,

04:53.066 --> 04:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then, on Monday, there was
a little bit more, and then
Tuesday, Wednesday, then today

04:57.666 --> 04:58.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
still another.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Mm-hmm.

04:59.666 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it is, Judy.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't know what to think.

05:02.366 --> 05:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, drip, drip, drip,
comes a downpour at some point.

05:05.300 --> 05:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How about the disparaging of
the United States intelligence
agencies and professionals by

05:12.300 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump, candidate Trump
and now President Trump, whether
Russia -- you know, I can't

05:16.733 --> 05:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be sure Russia was involved.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, probably, but not for sure.

05:20.066 --> 05:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, here they are, the Trump
Tower with the people, their
names approved on the visitors

05:27.000 --> 05:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list for the meeting in the
Trump Tower, and pretending
they didn't know it.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, no, it's -- David is right.

05:35.366 --> 05:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a management sense, it's
just been incredible, Judy.

05:42.466 --> 05:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Apparently, it's hit the
president or someone has
gotten to the president,
because his statement

05:45.566 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about his son was so
sort of homogenized,
he's a quality person.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He
said he's a good boy.

05:52.633 --> 05:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Good boy,
and praised him for
his transparency, which
is a little bit like,

05:59.666 --> 06:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as I'm about to be indicted
for tax evasion, say, well, I
want to make something clear.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I failed to pay my taxes.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It does open
up a bunch of questions,
like what were the -- this
-- as the intelligence

06:08.300 --> 06:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experts keep saying, this looked
like a Russian feeler operation.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just wanted to see
what kind of reaction they
could get from Donald Jr.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if they -- how do they
respond to the signal?

06:18.300 --> 06:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so what else did they do?

06:19.533 --> 06:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There must have been
other things they did.

06:21.033 --> 06:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The second, was it connected?

06:23.100 --> 06:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, as others have
cited, gave a speech in which
he said, we're about to have

06:25.700 --> 06:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a big set of revelations
about Hillary Clinton.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did that flow out
of this meeting?

06:29.900 --> 06:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what was the timing of that?

06:32.033 --> 06:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who else was in this meeting?

06:33.266 --> 06:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What actually was
said in the meeting?

06:35.333 --> 06:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still really -- we have some
testimonies, but what documents
were brought to the meeting?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It means there's another
several weeks of questions.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it gives Bob Mueller a
new channel to walk down.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just expanding.

06:46.566 --> 06:47.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
special counsel.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would just say
one thing about Mr. Mueller.

06:50.966 --> 06:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has an advantage and a
power that nobody else, that
none of us in the press has.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has the power of subpoena.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he has the power
of a grand jury.

07:00.933 --> 07:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has the alternative
of indictment for perjury.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you just can't keep
changing these stories.

07:09.066 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Jared Kushner now
has amended, as John Yang
pointed out at the beginning of

07:13.633 --> 07:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the show, point, his number
of contacts with foreign
individuals and interests, 100.

07:18.233 --> 07:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Three times, he's
now had to do so.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Added names.

07:22.566 --> 07:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And it raises
the question, who leaked these
e-mails on Donald Trump -- I

07:25.966 --> 07:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mean, on Donald Trump Jr.?

07:27.233 --> 07:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did they -- is there mistrust?

07:29.666 --> 07:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is distrust, I know, in
the White House whether it was
Kushner or Kushner's people,

07:34.133 --> 07:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that we had
to get this out.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meantime,
one thing, David, the president
is saying that he wants

07:39.700 --> 07:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Senate to get done
is health care reform.

07:42.200 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we now -- a few days ago,
we saw this newest, newer
version of health care reform

07:49.266 --> 07:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Leader McConnell is saying
that he really, really wants his
troops to come together behind.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they still aren't there.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it look like?

07:59.533 --> 08:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
interesting when you see the
reaction to this latest bill.

08:01.866 --> 08:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people say, oh, it
shifted to the right.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people say, oh, no,
it shifted to the left.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In reality, it short
of shifted both ways.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It keeps some of the taxes
on the rich, which some
of the moderates want.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes some deregulation
of the insurance markets, which
Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and some

08:15.200 --> 08:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the conservatives want.

08:16.433 --> 08:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it sort of moves
in both direction.

08:18.433 --> 08:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I give Mitch
McConnell credit.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is an incredibly
unpopular bill.

08:22.133 --> 08:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it probably couldn't
survive a set of public
hearings and scrutiny.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And yet he's got to the
point where he's kind
of close to getting it.

08:28.666 --> 08:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know if
we will get there.

08:29.666 --> 08:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I sort of would bet against it.

08:31.700 --> 08:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as an act of legislative
craftsmanship, if your only
goal is to pass something, then

08:37.900 --> 08:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say Mitch McConnell
has done about as well as you
can do by pushing a lot of

08:39.966 --> 08:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different buttons and bringing
people at least within the
ballpark, especially given how

08:43.433 --> 08:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unpopular this is.

08:45.533 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I still think it's a bad
bill because it does so
much to punish Medicaid
among a population

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that can afford it least.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just as a set of legislative
craftsmanship, I would say
McConnell is like turning all

08:56.066 --> 08:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the knobs and getting
people sort of close.

08:59.066 --> 09:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say maybe 40 percent
chance that he actually
passes something this summer.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think
it will go over the top?

09:04.533 --> 09:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't, Judy.

09:06.566 --> 09:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would just point out
Affordable Care Act was being
fought for 18 months in the

09:11.300 --> 09:12.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was always a public
case you could make for it.

09:15.466 --> 09:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was much criticism of it,
but the public case included
that women wouldn't be charged

09:22.400 --> 09:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than men, that nobody
could be denied coverage, that
the preexisting condition,

09:28.866 --> 09:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people would be
guaranteed insurance and
access to health care.

09:31.900 --> 09:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- and the inside
part was done by Harry Reid
in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi

09:38.833 --> 09:40.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the House.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is all inside.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no public argument.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Behind closed doors.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: There is no
public case that can --
Mitch McConnell can make.

09:48.933 --> 09:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no public case
addressing the -- you have
two minutes to address
the American people,

09:52.133 --> 09:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why is this better?

09:53.566 --> 09:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why will this Republican
plan be better for Americans?

09:56.833 --> 09:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why will it be better for those
who don't have health care?

09:59.300 --> 10:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why will it be better for the
elderly, for the poor, for
the quality of health care in

10:04.900 --> 10:05.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country?

10:05.833 --> 10:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no case to be made.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all inside baseball.

10:08.433 --> 10:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Can you get Dean Heller
by leaning on Governor
Sandoval in Nevada?

10:12.333 --> 10:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, that is what
it has come down to.

10:15.133 --> 10:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, to me, that is
a terrible failing.

10:19.433 --> 10:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If somehow they do wrangle
vote, what have they got?

10:22.133 --> 10:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got an incredibly
unpopular piece of legislation.

10:25.366 --> 10:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
anybody, David, making a
positive case for this?

10:28.233 --> 10:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not really.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say the insurance markets
are failing, the Obamacare
markets are failing, which is

10:32.666 --> 10:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
somewhat true.

10:34.766 --> 10:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want -- they say we have
to have a more market-driven
system to shove down costs,

10:38.533 --> 10:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is somewhat true.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I think there is a
public case that could be made.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think they're
particularly making it, which
is why it's so unpopular.

10:45.633 --> 10:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we had public
scrutiny -- say the insurance
markets -- this thing
called the Cruz amendments

10:50.366 --> 10:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives the insurance companies
a chance to charge less for
some people if they give a

10:53.933 --> 10:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fuller benefit for another.

10:55.933 --> 10:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that will do is,
let's put the insurance markets
into two different systems.

10:58.966 --> 10:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

10:59.966 --> 11:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so the
people who are healthy
will be paying a low fee.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the people who are
sick would be paying much more.

11:05.633 --> 11:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so whether you agree or
not with the principle, these
things actually have to work.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I'm not sure that
the way this is written,
this will actually even
just work as functioning

11:13.366 --> 11:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way to run a market, as the
health insurance companies
have been strongly saying, like

11:17.333 --> 11:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

11:19.466 --> 11:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We're waiting
to find out now whether it's
going to be 19 million or 24

11:22.333 --> 11:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million people who
are going to...

11:24.166 --> 11:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Knocked off.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Knocked
off health insurance.

11:27.433 --> 11:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, what everyone says
about the Affordable Care Act,
20 million Americans who didn't

11:29.833 --> 11:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have it then did have
health care coverage.

11:32.800 --> 11:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, let's be very blunt;
12 million of them came through
the extension of Medicaid.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the starvation of
Medicaid, seven years, 2024,
and the federal support on the

11:44.433 --> 11:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extension of
Medicaid disappears.

11:46.466 --> 11:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they can talk about
money and everything else, but
implicit in the Republican bill

11:52.966 --> 11:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is there's a difference in
those who are on Medicaid.

11:54.433 --> 11:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Somehow, they are takers.

11:55.766 --> 11:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Somehow, they are freeloaders.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not our fellow Americans
who are struggling to get by.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are
going to have to leave
it there on that note.

12:02.333 --> 12:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Shields, David
Brooks, thank you both.
