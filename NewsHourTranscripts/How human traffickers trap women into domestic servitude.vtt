JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: More
than three million migrant
workers every year, most of

00:04.400 --> 00:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them women, leave their
countries to work as domestic
laborers, often in conditions

00:09.366 --> 00:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some say border on slavery.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human trafficking is especially
grave in the Persian Gulf
and the Middle East.

00:16.433 --> 00:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro begins his report
from the West African nation of

00:21.300 --> 00:22.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cameroon.

00:22.466 --> 00:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his series
Agents for Change.

00:25.133 --> 00:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
able to laugh at it now in a
workshop setting, but the skit

00:35.533 --> 00:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these women are watching
depicts experiences
that are all too real.

00:42.566 --> 00:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These women are all survivors
from time spent in Persian
Gulf and Middle East countries

00:48.066 --> 00:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they were domestic
workers, victims of an industry
the U.N. and rights groups

00:52.133 --> 00:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say is rife with human
trafficking and abuse.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three years ago, Francisca
Awah was working as a secretary
in Cameroon and helping her

01:02.033 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mother sell vegetables.

01:03.833 --> 01:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She had a new baby and
with her fiance wanted
to build a nest egg.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Awah, who has a college
degree, jumped at what she
thought was a teaching job offer

01:12.733 --> 01:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Kuwait for 10 times
her salary in Cameroon.

01:17.166 --> 01:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She paid the sponsoring
agency $500, plus airfare.

01:20.933 --> 01:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But almost as soon as she landed
in Kuwait, she knew something
was wrong, an experience

01:25.866 --> 01:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
familiar to many in
this audience and
acted out in the skit.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You no like, you
give me $6,000, you go
back to your country.

01:32.500 --> 01:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The bait and
switch, an agent or trafficker
demanding large sums if

01:37.166 --> 01:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they weren't satisfied with
their job or pay, in Francisca
Awah's case, not teaching, but

01:42.800 --> 01:44.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cleaning.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH, Trafficking
Survivor: He started telling me,
you're going to work with me as

01:47.600 --> 01:49.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a maid.

01:49.133 --> 01:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will take care of my two
children and the house chores.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Awah says
she complained and asked for
her passport back, so she could

01:54.766 --> 01:56.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
return home.

01:56.700 --> 02:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Although it's illegal, workers'
passports are routinely
confiscated by employers.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The employer's wife refused,
saying she had paid the agency
$2,000 for her services.

02:08.166 --> 02:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH: And the lady
was so angry that she pointed
at the television and told

02:11.000 --> 02:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me that, Francisca,
you know something?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are like that television.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You are a commodity.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I bought you.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You need to pay back my
money before you leave.

02:17.766 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
She had bought you?

02:19.566 --> 02:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANCISCA AWAH: Yes.

02:21.666 --> 02:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Then, one
day, Awah saw a news report
about an organization, Freedom

02:25.433 --> 02:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For All, headed by an American
woman named Katie Ford.

02:28.700 --> 02:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE FORD, Freedom For All:
And she said, please help me.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are many in
much worse situations.

02:35.666 --> 02:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Please help us all.

02:37.133 --> 02:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Indeed,
Awah's story is far from unique.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each year, more than three
million women worldwide
are forced into servitude
as domestic workers.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ford was shocked
when she learned the
extent of the problem.

02:49.666 --> 02:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATIE FORD: Why aren't
we calling this slavery?

02:52.933 --> 02:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's people being forced to
work without pay, without
an ability to escape.

02:57.866 --> 03:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Katie
Ford is the former CEO of the
renowned Ford Modeling Agency.

03:04.733 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her parents started the business
in 1946, and represented
such high profile models as

03:10.900 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elle Macpherson and Naomi
Campbell, bringing standards to
an industry notorious for taking

03:15.433 --> 03:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advantage of young women.

03:17.433 --> 03:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ford was the first agency
to insist that models
be paid a fair wage.

03:21.266 --> 03:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE FORD: They made sure
the client paid, and they made
sure the models were protected.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the first
picture of her I saw.

03:32.200 --> 03:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Just as her
parents did for their models,
Katie Ford says she wanted

03:36.200 --> 03:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to advocate for
domestic workers.

03:38.600 --> 03:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her goal was to form
partnerships with
governments, employers and
human rights organizations.

03:45.666 --> 03:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first places
she started was Kuwait,
an oil-rich state of
nearly four million people

03:52.033 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where foreigners outnumber
native Kuwaitis by 2-1.

03:55.166 --> 03:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the only country in the
Persian Gulf region to even
acknowledge there's a problem

03:59.733 --> 04:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with domestic workers.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kuwait became the first country
in the Gulf region to pass a
law that attempts to protect

04:05.666 --> 04:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rights of domestic workers,
requiring at least one day
off a week, for example,

04:10.633 --> 04:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and setting the maximum number
of hours worked per week.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not much.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That maximum is 72 hours.

04:17.533 --> 04:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the law doesn't specify
that the worker be allowed out
of the home on that day off.

04:24.466 --> 04:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many, in fact, are forced
to remain in their employer's
home on their day off.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Kuwait government has
established a shelter,
with a capacity for 500,
where foreign domestic

04:35.633 --> 04:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers can escape
abusive employers.

04:39.166 --> 04:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were given a rare tour
of the facility by its
director, Falah al Mutairi.

04:43.233 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FALAH AL MUTAIRI, Shelter
Director (through translator):
The services that are provided

04:46.933 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
include legal services,
social, cultural and
emotional help if needed.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to deciding
what the next step is, it's
up to the individual herself.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does she want to
stay in the country?

04:56.533 --> 04:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's when we discuss options.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ninety percent of the
women want to go back
to their home countries.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Since the
shelter opened two-and-a-half
years ago, nearly 8,000 women

05:07.700 --> 05:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have passed through, waiting
for passports to be returned,
trying to find the means to

05:10.833 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buy return tickets, sorting
out various legal problems.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We spoke with five
women from countries as
diverse as Madagascar,
Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka,

05:21.133 --> 05:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nepal and the Philippines.

05:23.333 --> 05:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All said they were either
unpaid or severely underpaid.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many were lured here
under false pretenses.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nineteen-year-old
Hassanatu Bangura says her
parents thought they were
sending her to college.

05:34.966 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HASSANATU BANGURA, Trafficking
Survivor: I think I'm
going to start school.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we go to the office, and she
said that I'm going to work.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BIBI NASSER AL SABAH, Social
Work Society of Kuwait: We
have a domestic labor law, but

05:44.133 --> 05:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't have clear punishments
or punishments that are enough
to make an employer stop.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Bibi
Al Sabah is a member of
Kuwait's ruling family.

05:56.766 --> 06:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twelve years ago, she founded
an organization designed to
get workers legal help, also,

06:01.866 --> 06:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
she says, to change the
culture, and attitudes
toward domestic workers.

06:04.566 --> 06:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BIBI NASSER AL SABAH: We're
rich people, and we can afford
to have people working for us.

06:12.066 --> 06:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, with this idea, a
lot of people eventually
just lost track of how
humans should behave.

06:20.833 --> 06:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It became part of the culture
now to have workers everywhere.

06:25.633 --> 06:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so people forget that
they're humans and forget that
these people are -- have lives

06:31.800 --> 06:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and have children and
have their dignity.

06:33.833 --> 06:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Falah Al
Mutairi acknowledges that more
reforms need to happen, but he's

06:39.200 --> 06:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convinced that Kuwait
has turned a corner.

06:41.733 --> 06:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says that, to truly
eradicate the problem,
traffickers must be
held accountable in the

06:47.233 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
workers' countries.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FALAH AL MUTAIRI (through
translator): Because
of sovereignty issues,
Kuwait cannot track

06:52.400 --> 06:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down criminals in
other countries.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It can't do anything about
people outside its jurisdiction.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Francisca
Awah isn't sure she can stop
the traffickers either, but she

07:04.300 --> 07:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to help the
desperate economic plight
of women in low-income
countries like Cameroon.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After being rescued by Katie
Ford 18 months ago, the two
women have teamed up to form

07:13.700 --> 07:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a career training
program for women in this
West African country

07:17.700 --> 07:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH: I wish
that the girls should be
like empowered personally.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They should learn to do
something within their country.

07:23.766 --> 07:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Last fall,
Awah led a workshop with 34
young women who fled abusive

07:30.433 --> 07:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work situations in
the Middle East.

07:32.333 --> 07:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were learning how
to finance and start
their own businesses.

07:39.266 --> 07:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It included field trips to
restaurants and markets to
learn from other entrepreneurs

07:44.233 --> 07:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and team-building exercises.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You wake up.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You clean everywhere, OK?

07:48.833 --> 07:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Gatherings
like these have helped women
overcome, even laugh at

07:55.866 --> 07:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their traumatic experiences, and
maybe, they say, spread the word
to other would-be trafficking

08:00.266 --> 08:02.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victims.

08:02.266 --> 08:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
this is Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Kumba, Cameroon.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told
Stories Project at the

08:14.300 --> 08:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota.
