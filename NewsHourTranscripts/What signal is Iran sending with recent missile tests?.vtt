JUDY WOODRUFF: The prospects for
a thaw in relations between the

00:03.937 --> 00:05.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Iran that some thought
possible after the nuclear deal

00:07.808 --> 00:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were again set back this week,
after several flash points that

00:11.712 --> 00:13.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
showed the fundamental
disagreements that remain.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he landmark nuclear accord
signed in July between Iran and

00:17.384 --> 00:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
six world powers led by the
United States is soon due to be

00:21.989 --> 00:23.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
implemented fully.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just this week, most of Iran's
stockpiles of low-enriched

00:25.893 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uranium were removed from the
country by ship.

00:28.729 --> 00:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ut there are renewed tensions
between Iran and the U.S.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could affect the nuclear
accord.

00:34.401 --> 00:38.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Recent ballistic missile tests
by Iran were said by the United

00:38.305 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations to violate prohibitions
on missile testing.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Obama administration then
drew up additional sanctions on

00:43.977 --> 00:45.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iran's missile program.

00:45.145 --> 00:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ut, last night, The Wall
Street Journal reported the

00:48.248 --> 00:51.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House had delayed those
sanctions for now.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran's president, Hassan
Rouhani, said yesterday his

00:53.553 --> 00:56.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation wouldn't only continue
its missile development, but

00:56.390 --> 00:57.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expand it.

00:57.624 --> 01:00.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd just last weekend, Iranian
boats within the very tight

01:00.694 --> 01:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quarters of the Straits of
Hormuz, the gateway to the

01:04.231 --> 01:07.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Persian Gulf, fired a rocket
near the U.S.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aircraft carrier Harry Truman, a
move the U.S.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called highly provocative.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The carrier and its battle
group, and a French naval

01:14.508 --> 01:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vessel, were sailing into the
Gulf to continue the bombardment

01:18.045 --> 01:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria.

01:20.881 --> 01:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
s we begin the new year, where
do things stand between the U.S.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Iran?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or that we turn to Karim
Sadjadpour.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for

01:31.525 --> 01:32.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
International Peace.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elcome back to the program.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie
Endowment For International

01:36.129 --> 01:37.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Peace: Thank you, Judy.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: So, what is
going on with Iran?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's behind these missile
tests, what appears to be

01:43.937 --> 01:46.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provocative firing very close to
a U.S.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ship?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Judy, when we
describe Iran's political

01:49.576 --> 01:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factions, we commonly use the
term moderates and hard-liners.

01:52.779 --> 01:57.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
erhaps a more appropriate term
would be to call them -- you

01:57.050 --> 01:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the bridge-builders, people
like President Rouhani and

01:59.886 --> 02:03.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foreign Minister Zarif, that
want to build bridges with the

02:03.523 --> 02:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
West, with the United States,
and you have the saboteurs,

02:07.094 --> 02:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those who are very concerned
about the prospect of a more

02:10.998 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integrated Iran.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ithin the Revolutionary
Guards, you have a lot of

02:14.901 --> 02:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saboteurs, people who don't have
much in terms of their popular

02:18.805 --> 02:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support, but they have a lot in
terms of coercive power.

02:22.709 --> 02:26.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that the missile
tests, the imprisonment of dual

02:26.613 --> 02:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationals are all meant as a
signal to the United States that

02:30.884 --> 02:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nuclear deal is not about a
broader rapprochement, the

02:34.454 --> 02:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations are going to remain
antagonistic, and to Iran's own

02:38.025 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
population to send the signal,
don't think the nuclear

02:41.228 --> 02:43.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compromise was a sign of
weakness.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We remain strong and in control.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Were these
tests, Karim, legal, though,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under the terms of the nuclear
deal?

02:50.804 --> 02:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: The missile
tests weren't a violation of the

02:54.374 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear deal, but they were a
violation of U.N.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Security Council resolutions.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd I think this is the dilemma
that the Obama administration is

03:02.983 --> 03:04.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

03:04.217 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, on one hand, the nuclear
deal with Iran could be the

03:07.587 --> 03:10.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crowning foreign policy
achievement of the Obama

03:10.090 --> 03:11.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't want to pursue
sanctions if it is going to

03:14.327 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
undermine the nuclear deal.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: What role did
the discussion in Washington, in

03:19.299 --> 03:23.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the White House, the reporting
that the White House might be

03:23.203 --> 03:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prepared to propose sanctions in
response, what role does that

03:26.773 --> 03:28.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
play in all of this?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, I think
people in Tehran certainly

03:31.745 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably recognize the dilemma
the Obama administration has.

03:34.581 --> 03:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hey don't want to do anything
to sabotage the nuclear deal.

03:38.518 --> 03:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't want to do anything
which could potentially weaken

03:42.089 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these bridge-builders I was
talking about in Tehran.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the same time, they want to
react to Iran's provocations.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
o, I think that, internally in
the White House, there is

03:52.799 --> 03:56.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably debate between folks at
Treasury, at the Pentagon and

03:56.369 --> 03:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those who are at the White House
and State Department.

03:59.940 --> 04:04.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: And you see --
of course, you had a number of

04:04.644 --> 04:08.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans -- as soon as Iran
did this missile testing and the

04:08.915 --> 04:12.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other tests, there were comments
from Republicans saying, see, in

04:12.486 --> 04:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
essence, we told you so, we
can't trust Iran.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hat clearly puts pressure on
the White House.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so how do the Iranians read
that?

04:21.361 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, I
think, Judy, there is not only

04:24.931 --> 04:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be pressure from
Republicans, but also many

04:28.135 --> 04:30.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats who supported the
Obama administration.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd I think that -- you know,
what I always tell people, that

04:34.908 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this nuclear deal is going to
take -- it has to be judged over

04:39.913 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the course of years, not months.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not going to bring about a
rapprochement between the United

04:45.986 --> 04:47.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States and Iran anytime soon.

04:47.754 --> 04:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd we're going to have to --
it's a 10-year agreement.

04:51.691 --> 04:56.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to have to
assess it in the months to -- in

04:56.696 --> 05:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years to come, but it's going to
be a very perilous deal.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's many saboteurs in
Washington and Tehran.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Is it possible
it could become derailed if this

05:07.874 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of activity continues?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Absolutely.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that there are so many
moving parts to this deal.

05:14.681 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then you look at the places
in the Middle East in which the

05:19.686 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States and Iran are in
potential zones of conflict,

05:23.256 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether that's Syria, the
Israeli-Palestinian issue.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's lots of traps here.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Yes, very
complex.

05:29.296 --> 05:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inally, Karim, a number of --
there has been reporting about a

05:33.600 --> 05:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of Iranian-Americans
imprisoned in Iran.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's an additional irritant in
the relationship.

05:38.238 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that play a role in all
this, or is that just side

05:42.909 --> 05:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activity as far as the Iranians
are concerned?

05:45.779 --> 05:49.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, I don't
think it's affected the Obama

05:49.349 --> 05:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration's position toward
Iran, but, certainly, it sours

05:52.219 --> 05:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mood in the United States,
when, after this nuclear deal,

05:56.156 --> 05:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran goes and imprisons innocent
Iranian-Americans, including my

05:59.025 --> 06:00.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
friend Siamak Namazi.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it sends a signal to
diaspora Iranians around the

06:04.097 --> 06:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world that, don't think that
Iran is welcome and open to

06:08.034 --> 06:09.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business to all of you.

06:09.803 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This remains a close state ruled
by the Revolutionary Guards and

06:13.740 --> 06:14.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the supreme leader.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: And that is my
final question.

06:17.677 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Should Americans understand that
the hard-liners are in charge in

06:21.281 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran or those who seek to be
bridge-builders?

06:24.150 --> 06:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: I think a
wonderful quote that captures

06:27.387 --> 06:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today's Middle East is from the
poem, a poem from Yeats, who

06:31.725 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, the best lack all
conviction and the worst are

06:35.328 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
full of passionate intensity.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd I think, unfortunately,
within Iran, the hard-liners are

06:40.000 --> 06:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very much a minority, but they
continue to have a bulk of
