I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:09.509 --> 00:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Hillary Clinton targets reliably
red Arizona,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while Donald Trump focuses on
victory in Florida.

00:16.450 --> 00:21.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With only six days left, a look
at how control
of the Senate will affect the
next president.

00:21.955 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
life in Turkey after the failed
coup.

00:26.994 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Massive purges of public
officials, and a
growing list of detained
journalists reveal

00:31.231 --> 00:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a more controlling government.

00:33.033 --> 00:38.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And surviving
under the sea
-- how scientists are using
robots to learn

00:38.505 --> 00:40.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mysteries of early oceanic
life.

00:40.941 --> 00:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN, University of
California, Davis:
This is new information that
hasn't really

00:45.712 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
existed up until now.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're sort of cracking the
black box of
larval behavior.

00:50.918 --> 00:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.625 --> 01:01.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.561 --> 01:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Six days to go,
and the candidates
are trying toes navigate a
presidential election

01:11.405 --> 01:13.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
map that's still shifting.

01:13.707 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That had Donald Trump trying
today to nail
down one must-win state, while
Hillary Clinton

01:19.413 --> 01:21.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tries to deny him another.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
My second home, you know that.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm here all the time.

01:25.652 --> 01:29.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was Donald
Trump today
back in vote-rich Florida, a
state he's visited

01:29.656 --> 01:31.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
often in recent weeks.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, in Miami, he sounded
newly confident.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And the polls have
just come
up.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're way up in Florida.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I shouldn't say that, because I
want you to
go vote.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:41.234 --> 01:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are going to
pretend we're
down.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're down.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pretend, right?

01:47.874 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will pretend we're down.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, we got to win, we got to win
big.

01:50.677 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The race in
Florida is, in
fact, neck-and-neck, and Hillary
Clinton started

01:54.481 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off her day less than an hour's
drive away,
visiting an early polling site
in Fort Lauderdale.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, afterward, flew west to
campaign
in Nevada.

02:04.891 --> 02:10.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, tonight, she's in Arizona,
in past years
a Republican stronghold.

02:10.497 --> 02:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her running mate, Tim Kaine, and
his wife,
Anne Holton, are on the
hustings, too, of

02:15.335 --> 02:21.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course, as are President Obama
and Vice President
Biden, former President Bill
Clinton and daughter

02:21.908 --> 02:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chelsea, plus Senators Bernie
Sanders and
Elizabeth Warren.

02:26.646 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're fanning out to election
battlegrounds
from Ohio to Nevada.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
If Hillary wins North Carolina,
she wins.

02:32.886 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The most
prominent surrogate
of them all spent his time
campaigning for

02:37.591 --> 02:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina.

02:39.659 --> 02:44.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: When I said the
fate of the
republic rests on you, I wasn't
joking.

02:44.931 --> 02:50.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young people here, it's not
often that you
know your voice will have an
impact.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't let it slip away.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Don't give away your power.

02:53.073 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier, on the
social media
platform Now This News, the
president called

02:57.611 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's use of a
private e-mail
server as secretary of state an
honest mistake.

03:04.017 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also addressed the FBI's
review of newly
discovered e-mails.

03:08.955 --> 03:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't directly criticize
director James
Comey, but he did say:

03:13.360 --> 03:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I do think that
there is a norm
that, you know, when there are
investigations,

03:22.235 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't operate on innuendo, we
don't operate
on incomplete information, we
don't operate

03:27.474 --> 03:29.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on leaks.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We operate based on concrete
decisions that
are made.

03:32.879 --> 03:37.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Donald
Trump is
devoting his whole day to
Florida, while his

03:37.851 --> 03:43.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrogates spread across the
electoral map
as well, running mate Mike
Pence, Trump's

03:43.523 --> 03:49.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, Donald Jr., Ivanka,
Tiffany and
Eric with his wife, Lara, former
New York

03:49.696 --> 03:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and former
House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.

03:54.267 --> 03:59.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence was dispatched to Arizona,
ahead of
Clinton's visit there tonight,
trying to keep

03:59.606 --> 04:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state in the Republican
column, where
it's been 11 of the last 12
presidential election

04:05.412 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news,
investigators around Des Moines,
Iowa, are

04:09.416 --> 04:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking for a motive in the
ambush killings
of two policemen early today.

04:13.453 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 46-year-old suspect, Scott
Michael Greene,
was arrested hours later.

04:17.157 --> 04:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities say both officers
were sitting
in their police cars when they
were shot to

04:21.394 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The killings happened less than
two miles
apart.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL PARIZEK, Des Moines Police
Department:
What we can tell by looking at
the scene is

04:27.300 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it doesn't appear that
either officer
had an opportunity to interact
with the suspect.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't look like there was
an exchange
of conversation.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't look like there was
an opportunity
-- there definitely wasn't an
opportunity

04:37.344 --> 04:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for these officers to defend
themselves and
respond to the attack.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Police say
they believe
the gunman acted alone.

04:42.549 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: South Africa's
President Jacob
Zuma faced increasing public
pressure to step

04:47.821 --> 04:49.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down today.

04:49.489 --> 04:53.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A state watchdog report found
signs of corruption
at top levels of the government.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report came out after Zuma
abandoned efforts
to block it.

04:57.564 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also faced thousands of
protesters in the
streets of Pretoria demanding he
resign.

05:03.003 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pointed to a series of
scandals, including
spending millions in state funds
on Zuma's

05:08.441 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rural home.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: He is under siege now even
from his own
quarters.

05:14.314 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ANC is speaking out loud
against him.

05:19.119 --> 05:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And society, I think, has come
to realize
that we have come to the end of
the road for

05:25.492 --> 05:27.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The corruption
report also
calls for a judicial inquiry
into new allegations

05:29.763 --> 05:31.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Zuma engaged in
influence-peddling.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, the
Federal Reserve finished its
latest meeting

05:35.635 --> 05:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with no change in short-term
interest rates.

05:38.738 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, policy-makers said they
want to see
further gains in the job market
and economic

05:42.976 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They hinted a rate hike could
come at their
next meeting in December.

05:46.947 --> 05:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, election
jitters and a drop in oil prices
sent stocks

05:51.685 --> 05:53.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lower again.

05:53.053 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 77 points
to close at 17959.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 48, and the S&amp;P
500 gave up
13.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's do-or-die
tonight for
the Chicago Cubs and the
Cleveland Indians

06:06.967 --> 06:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in game seven of the World
Series.

06:08.902 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fans in both cities are hoping
their teams
put an end to decades of
waiting.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cubs haven't won a World
Series since
1908, and the Indians last
claimed a title

06:17.310 --> 06:18.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1948.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there's a new
king in the
World Series of Poker.

06:22.515 --> 06:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Qui Nguyen won the tournament's
main event
early today in Las Vegas, after
nine hours

06:28.388 --> 06:31.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and 364 hands.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a native of Vietnam, who's
applied for
U.S. citizenship.

06:34.894 --> 06:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he plans to donate a
portion of his
$8 million in winnings to poor
families in

06:40.333 --> 06:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vietnam and to the Wounded
Warrior Project.

06:43.336 --> 06:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
which presidential candidate
appeals most

06:47.173 --> 06:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to voters with disabilities;
from marijuana
to the death penalty, key ballot
issues in

06:52.579 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next week's election; Turkey's
growing crackdown
on journalists; and much more.

07:01.321 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No matter who
wins next week's
presidential election, the party
that controls

07:13.566 --> 07:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the balance of power in the U.S.
House and
Senate will play a critical role
in determining

07:18.571 --> 07:20.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what gets done.

07:20.573 --> 07:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Important issues such as health
care, immigration,
trade and the makeup of the
federal courts

07:25.679 --> 07:27.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will all be affected.

07:27.614 --> 07:32.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore that now with Gerald
Seib, the
Washington bureau chief for The
Wall Street

07:32.285 --> 07:33.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Journal.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Norman Ornstein, he's a
resident scholar
at the American Enterprise
Institute.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Jerry, I'm going to start
with you.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are, what, six or seven
Senate seats
that are literally up for grabs
right now.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do those races -- how do
they look like?

07:47.434 --> 07:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB, Washington Bureau
Chief, The
Wall Street Journal: It's
interesting, because

07:49.202 --> 07:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of weeks ago, the
Democrats got fairly
confident they were pulling away
and were

07:52.272 --> 07:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to have the margin.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then several of those races
have narrowed
down in the last couple of
weeks, sort of

07:56.943 --> 07:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like the presidential race, and
not by coincidence.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if the Democrats can hang on
in Nevada,
where Harry Reid is retiring,
which is a little

08:03.783 --> 08:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
iffy, and if they pick up a seat
in Illinois,
which seems likely, then they're
going to

08:08.254 --> 08:13.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to find three or four seats
in Indiana,
Missouri, North Carolina, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania

08:13.393 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Wisconsin.

08:15.261 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In each of those states, the
Republicans trying
to hang on have done a little
better than

08:19.399 --> 08:23.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump in those states,
which is why
Republicans have some hope that
they can hang

08:23.336 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, the most interesting one
in the last
few days has been Wisconsin,
which looked

08:27.073 --> 08:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as it was kind of moving away
from Ron Johnson,
the Republican incumbent.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now it's tightening up

08:32.245 --> 08:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of a sudden, there's
money pouring
in from both parties into
Wisconsin.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We could see
changes.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the point is, it's hanging
in the balance,
Norm.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

08:40.153 --> 08:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN, Resident
Scholar, American
Enterprise Institute: It's
hanging in the

08:40.453 --> 08:41.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
balance.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, if Hillary Clinton
wins the White
House, need four seats.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they win four, it's a tied
Senate, and
the vice president casts the
tie-breaking

08:48.361 --> 08:50.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

08:50.196 --> 08:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One caveat here is that if that
does happen
and there's a tie, the seat in
Virginia, which

08:55.201 --> 09:01.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would be vacated by the
then-vice president-elect
Tim Kaine, would be filled by
Governor Terry

09:01.341 --> 09:02.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McAuliffe.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be a Democrat, but only
for a year.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then there's a special election.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And their majority would be in
jeopardy if
that happened.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're off to
the races
again.

09:09.749 --> 09:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we're here to talk about,
Jerry, about
what difference does it make
whether -- let's

09:14.821 --> 09:16.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just start out assuming Hillary
Clinton wins.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will talk in a minute
about Donald
Trump.

09:18.425 --> 09:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if she wins and she doesn't
have a Senate
in -- her party with the
majority of Democrats,

09:25.098 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what does that mean for what she
wants to
do?

09:26.966 --> 09:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: Well, you know, at
some level,
if somebody is in control of the
Senate by

09:31.604 --> 09:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
51 to 49 seats, nobody is in
control of the
Senate.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don't have a working
majority.

09:35.442 --> 09:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it really does matter who
has the 51,
because you form the committees.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You name the committee chairmen.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You set the agenda.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You decide what gets considered
and what doesn't.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And however that mix works out,
I think one
of the things that has happened
in the last

09:47.187 --> 09:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few weeks that would be very
problematic for
a President Hillary Clinton is
that many of

09:52.358 --> 09:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these Republicans who do hang on
are going
to hang on because they have
gone to the voters

09:55.662 --> 09:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said, vote for me because I
will be a
check on Hillary Clinton.

09:59.666 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're going to come to
town and their
mandate is going to be block the
new President

10:03.803 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, not to work with the
new President
Clinton.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whatever the math is, I
think that's a
serious problem for her.

10:08.908 --> 10:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Norm, what
are the initiatives
that could go either way
depending on what

10:13.079 --> 10:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Senate does if she is
president?

10:14.881 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Well, let's
talk about the
most important element and why
winning the

10:17.750 --> 10:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate is absolutely crucial for
her for governing,
and that is the Senate's unique
power to advise

10:23.790 --> 10:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and consent on executive and
judicial nominations.

10:27.527 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where having the 50 or 51
matters the
most, because if -- and getting
to Jerry's

10:32.632 --> 10:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, if there's a Republican
majority, the
Republicans, from Mitch
McConnell, the leader,

10:37.437 --> 10:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on down have made clear that
they're not going
to confirm her judges.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have now had a number of
senators,
including Richard Burr in North
Carolina,

10:44.410 --> 10:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is one of the ones who seats
is very much
in jeopardy, and Ted Cruz and
others say,

10:49.749 --> 10:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we won't confirm a Supreme Court
justice for
four years, for the entire term.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they can keep a vote from
even taking
place.

10:57.724 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if the Democrats have the
majority, even
by a narrow margin, all the
judgeships below

11:03.696 --> 11:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court level can be
confirmed without
a filibuster with 50 votes, and
you could

11:08.768 --> 11:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change the rules, if need be, to
deal with
the Supreme Court.

11:12.071 --> 11:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other than that, we're not going
to see much
legislation going through, Judy,
because even

11:16.509 --> 11:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they have the Senate, they
don't have the
House.

11:18.778 --> 11:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having that initiative,
having the ability
to frame an agenda, to bring up
an infrastructure

11:23.716 --> 11:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill, which would be a top
priority, to bring
up a fix to the health care
plan, that's critical

11:28.955 --> 11:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if Hillary Clinton is going to
make any progress
through the normal process, the
regular order,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the legislative process.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Jerry, what
happens if
-- say the Democrats do eke out
a majority

11:38.264 --> 11:39.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Senate.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is she then able to do, if
she's elected?

11:42.135 --> 11:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: Well, you know, I
think, as Norm
says, the first thing is, you
can get your

11:46.005 --> 11:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in place to run the
government.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not a small thing.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we even get to that
stage, one of the
things the Clinton team would
really like

11:52.912 --> 11:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Merrick Garland, the Supreme
Court nominee,
to be confirmed in a lame-duck
session.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who President
Obama nominated.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERALD SEIB: Right, who
President Obama has
nominated, whose nomination is
sitting there.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would like that out of the
way, so that
doesn't take all the oxygen out
of the room.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I think you can sort of
move on to at
least attempting a few basic
things.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the number one thing
on the agenda
would be to try to get a bill
that spends

12:11.965 --> 12:16.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a bunch of money on
infrastructure in this
country that is actually a
bipartisan idea.

12:16.035 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has proposed
spending more than
Hillary Clinton on
infrastructure.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Business likes it.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republicans like it.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican governors out in the
country would
like that infrastructure money.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe there's a path, even in
this partisan
environment, in this divided
world we're talking

12:29.482 --> 12:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, to get something like
that done.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I agree with Norm.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's not going to be an
ambitious agenda,
at least at first.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before we quickly
get to Donald
Trump, I just want to say, we're
not talking

12:36.756 --> 12:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much about the House of
Representatives,
Norm, because we assume, given
what we're

12:40.693 --> 12:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing out there, that it's not
going to change
hands.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will remain in Republican
control.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Yes.

12:45.531 --> 12:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats need 30 seats to win
the House,
and that is a steeply, steeply
uphill climb.

12:49.035 --> 12:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our expectation has been that
they will pick
up seats and they will reduce
the Republican

12:53.139 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it might go down into the 10
seats.

12:56.209 --> 13:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that will, by the way, be an
enormous
challenge to Paul Ryan if he
decides to try

13:00.813 --> 13:07.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to continue as speaker, because
leadership
advocates, those who are loyal
to him, are

13:07.186 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to be reduced in number.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with a smaller number, those
who are antithetical
to him, the Freedom Caucus from
his radical

13:13.559 --> 13:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right, are going to be stronger.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's a challenge to him.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a challenge to her if
she wins the
presidency.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
quickly, Jerry,
talk about Donald Trump.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he is elected president,
we're assuming
the Senate and the House stay
Republican,

13:24.837 --> 13:28.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just because it would what they
call maybe
a wave election.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What could he get done?

13:29.976 --> 13:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: Well, in that case,
the presumption
that Republicans in Congress
have is that

13:33.980 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're going to step forward
and fill a policy
gap.

13:36.215 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump presidential candidate
-- presidential
campaign has been policy-light.

13:40.086 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think they believe the
policy-making for
the Republican Party would move
down Pennsylvania

13:44.290 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Avenue to the Capitol, to the
Congress.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not sure Donald Trump
will agree with
that.

13:48.428 --> 13:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the problem becomes,
there are key
issues, immigration and trade
being chief

13:53.232 --> 13:56.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
among them, where the
Republicans in Congress
are not in agreement with Donald
Trump the

13:56.969 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential candidate.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know how they resolve
that.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: So, we know
what -- the one
thing they can all agree on,
which is a great

14:03.342 --> 14:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big tax cut, particularly for
the rich.

14:06.979 --> 14:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in Congress and
Donald Trump have
that in common.

14:10.316 --> 14:15.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost nothing else will move
very far, in
part because Democrats will
filibuster almost

14:15.521 --> 14:16.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all of the initiatives.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most interesting one,
though, Judy, is
the health care.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, there's talk of repeal
and replace.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't have a replace plan.

14:24.230 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if they all take the
majority, it is going
to be like the dog chasing the
bus who catches

14:28.568 --> 14:29.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you do then?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, either way,
it looks
like there are a lot of question
marks about

14:33.072 --> 14:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what either one can get done.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Norman Ornstein, Jerry Seib, we
thank you
both.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: Thank you, Judy.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Thank you.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to an often
overlooked political issue, the
well-being

14:42.915 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those with disabilities.

14:44.717 --> 14:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A bipartisan poll out today
showed that 51
percent of the American people
either have

14:49.388 --> 14:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a disability themselves or have
a family member
or a close friend with one.

14:55.828 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politics wasn't much of a
discussion at the
Breaux household in Fairfax,
Virginia, until:

15:00.333 --> 15:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA BREAUX, Virginia: I was
upstairs, and
he was in the basement with a
very trusted

15:04.070 --> 15:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
therapist, and I hear him
screaming.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I came down and I was like,
what?

15:09.308 --> 15:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I look, and Trump is on the
television,
and he has this guttural scream.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I grabbed the boards and I
said, what
is going on?

15:15.681 --> 15:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when he said, seeing
this actually
gives -- makes my stomach hurt.

15:19.152 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He is Sara's son,
Ben Breaux,
a 16-year-old with nonverbal
autism.

15:26.025 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben can't speak out loud, so he
communicates
by spelling out his thoughts,
letter by letter.

15:36.102 --> 15:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After seeing a lot of Donald
Trump on TV,
many of those thoughts are now
about the presidential

15:43.509 --> 15:44.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

15:44.510 --> 15:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: I saw T-R-U...

15:48.147 --> 15:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A minute later:

15:51.150 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: I saw Trump on TV,
and it really
U-P-S-E-T -- and it really me.

16:01.761 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was it that
he said, or
that he did?

16:05.998 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What was it?

16:07.834 --> 16:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: H-E -- he --
S-A-I-D -- he said
-- he said things that were
disrespectful

16:19.378 --> 16:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to so M-A-N-Y -- to so many.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said things that were so mean
and disrespectful
to so many.

16:26.953 --> 16:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ben is too young
to cast a
vote this year, but he's part of
a growing

16:31.924 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demographic.

16:33.926 --> 16:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 35 million Americans
with disabilities
will be eligible to vote,
accounting for almost

16:39.098 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one-sixth of the electorate.

16:41.601 --> 16:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All told, almost 63 million
voters either
have a disability or live with
someone who

16:48.140 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a quarter of all eligible
voters.

16:51.911 --> 16:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those figures are only
projected to grow
as the population ages.

16:55.882 --> 16:59.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI,
RespectAbility: In
the past, a third of people with
disabilities

16:59.752 --> 17:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been Democrats, and a third
have been
Republicans, and a third have
been independents.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're the ultimate swing
voter group.

17:07.293 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jennifer Laszlo
Mizrahi runs
RespectAbility, a nonprofit that
promotes

17:13.366 --> 17:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disability rights and
employment.

17:16.102 --> 17:21.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says voters with
disabilities aren't a
monolithic group, but there is
common ground

17:21.540 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on one issue: inclusion.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: People
with disabilities
don't want anyone to look down
at us.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We want, really, these
opportunities to be
included fully.

17:31.784 --> 17:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we want to be included in
school, we want
to be included in our faith
community, we

17:36.188 --> 17:40.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
want to be included in
everything, including
in political campaigns.

17:40.393 --> 17:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unlike in past
presidential
contests, disability is
something both campaigns

17:45.798 --> 17:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have addressed this cycle, even
if inadvertently.

17:48.868 --> 17:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last fall, Trump drew outrage
from the disability
community and beyond when he
mocked a news

17:55.574 --> 17:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporter with a congenital
condition.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You got to see the guy.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, I don't know what I said.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, I don't remember.

18:02.281 --> 18:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton's
campaign
quickly seized on the moment,
with national

18:06.652 --> 18:08.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TV ads like this one.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Donald Trump doesn't see
people like
me.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He just sees disability.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I honestly feel bad for someone
with so much
hate in his heart.

18:18.731 --> 18:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton had
already addressed
people with disabilities in her
campaign platform,

18:23.936 --> 18:28.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
calling for more job
opportunities and tax
credits for their caregivers.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We have got to build an
inclusive economy

18:30.710 --> 18:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that welcomes people with
disabilities, values
their work, treats them with
respect.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:37.049 --> 18:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump doesn't
address disability
issues in detail on his Web
site.

18:41.020 --> 18:45.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He discusses the issue mostly
through the
lens of military veterans and
PTSD.

18:45.858 --> 18:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A shocking 20
veterans are committing
suicide each and every day,
especially our

18:55.101 --> 18:56.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
older veterans.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a national tragedy
that's not talked
about.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:01.841 --> 19:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That is why we
must increase
the number of mental health care
professionals

19:05.778 --> 19:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the VA, while ensuring
that veterans
can access private mental health
care as well.

19:12.251 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Laszlo Mizrahi
says the Clinton
camp is aware of the contrast.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: It's
very clear that
the campaign understands that,
when it comes

19:20.626 --> 19:26.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the sort of product
differentiation between
herself and Mr. Trump, that this
is an issue

19:26.098 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that plays in her favor.

19:27.900 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe so, but the
lack of a
full platform on disabilities
has not deterred

19:33.539 --> 19:39.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservatives like Melissa
Ortiz, who took
part in early voting in
Washington, D.C.

19:40.012 --> 19:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has spina bifida, and she
uses a service
dog, Annie Oakley, to alert her
when a seizure

19:45.751 --> 19:47.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is coming on.

19:47.553 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ortiz is an activist who was all
in for Texas
Senator Ted Cruz in the primary,
but now she

19:53.759 --> 19:55.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backs Trump.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA ORTIZ, Trump Supporter:
It wasn't
an easy decision to come to, but
I'm going

19:57.296 --> 20:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do it, because it's -- I
believe in his
vision for our country, more
than I believe

20:01.801 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in her vision for our country.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Especially when
it comes to
disability policy.

20:06.672 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA ORTIZ: I do think she
will create
more dependency under the guise
of creating

20:10.776 --> 20:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independence, because, again,
her idea is,
it takes a village to raise a
child and the

20:15.681 --> 20:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government needs to do for you.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, thank you, I can do very
well for myself.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most other people that I
know with disabilities
believe that they can do well
for themselves,

20:23.722 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need -- they need a little
help.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't need to be taken care
of.

20:27.460 --> 20:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ortiz says her
vote for Trump
put policy above personality.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA ORTIZ: Do I like the way
that he talks
about women?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do I like some of the things
that he's said
about people with disabilities?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely not.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't vote with my lady parts,
and I don't
vote with my wheelchair.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I vote with this and I vote with
this.

20:47.079 --> 20:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, back
at the Breaux
household, mom Sara says she
agrees with her

20:53.085 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
son.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When it comes to issues
affecting individuals
with disabilities, do you have a
clear sense

20:58.858 --> 21:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of which candidate is better on
those issues?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: I think Hillary
Clinton is.

21:02.862 --> 21:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the biggest concern for all
of us is not
just today, which is a concern,
but the future.

21:08.667 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of programs are there
for when we're
not the support system?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is something that she
has addressed.

21:14.707 --> 21:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Candidates aside,
after 18
straight months of campaigning,
Ben adds what

21:20.379 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many of us have been thinking.

21:23.482 --> 21:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: Y-E-A-R -- year
with -- W-I-T-H
-- I-S -- year is too long to
have to deal

21:33.526 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA BREAUX: Y-E-A-R -- year
with -- W-I-T-H
-- I-S -- year is too long to
have to deal

21:39.265 --> 21:41.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with this.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's focus
now on a different
election story, ballot
initiatives and measures

21:45.905 --> 21:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the state and local level.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a big year for it.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are more than 150 at the
state level
this year.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

21:53.646 --> 21:58.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Next Tuesday,
legalizing marijuana
for medical or recreational use
is on the

21:58.484 --> 22:00.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ballot in nine states.

22:00.419 --> 22:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And voters across the country
will also decide
other contentious issues,
including gun control,

22:05.524 --> 22:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care and prescription
drug costs, the
death penalty and the minimum
wage.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a look at some of these
issues with
two people who are following
them very closely.

22:14.733 --> 22:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Myers is the Sacramento
bureau chief
for The Los Angeles Times, and
Josh Altic

22:19.238 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tracks ballot issues for
Ballotpedia, a nonpartisan
online political encyclopedia.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh, John, thank you both for
joining us.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, let me start with you.

22:28.814 --> 22:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, as usual, has a long
list of ballot
initiatives that voters have to
decide next

22:35.888 --> 22:37.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tuesday.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And let's start with marijuana.

22:39.558 --> 22:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California voters approved
marijuana for medicinal
use in 1996, and rejected it for
recreational

22:46.632 --> 22:49.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
use in 2010.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why is it back?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what's different this time?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MYERS, The Los Angeles
Times: Yes, I
mean, it's a good question.

22:53.472 --> 22:54.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why is it back?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're the largest state in the
country.

22:56.375 --> 23:00.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there has been the
sense that
there is a sea change in the way
Californians

23:00.813 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
view this, I think, in some ways
mirrored
in other parts of the country as
well, and

23:06.085 --> 23:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly efforts in Colorado
and Washington
state have gotten a lot of
attention here

23:09.688 --> 23:11.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in California.

23:11.523 --> 23:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This measure, I will tell you,
is drafted
much differently than the
measure that failed

23:15.527 --> 23:16.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2010.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's more detailed.

23:18.397 --> 23:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has more details about taxes
that are imposed
at the state and local level on
marijuana.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's backed by a couple of
very big people.

23:25.070 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lieutenant governor of the
state, Gavin
Newsom, and Sean Parker, the
impresario behind

23:29.541 --> 23:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Napster and Facebook in Silicon
Valley, a
wealthy financier, have both
gotten behind

23:35.681 --> 23:36.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

23:36.682 --> 23:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has a lot of institutional
support.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the polling shows that it is
doing pretty
well.

23:40.853 --> 23:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How you get to legalization, I
think California
is watching these other state,
but at this

23:45.891 --> 23:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point, it looks voters are
probably going
to say yes.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Josh, what other
states is
this on the ballot in?

23:51.196 --> 23:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is -- we see oftentimes
ballot initiates
leading the way for federal law,
federal policy.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's still illegal at the
federal level.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Could this be the tipping point
this year?

24:02.641 --> 24:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH ALTIC, Ballotpedia: There
has been a
lot of discussion about whether
this is the

24:06.378 --> 24:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year that will really push
towards removal
of federal prohibition.

24:11.417 --> 24:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have it -- so, 80 million
people live
in states this year where
marijuana laws could

24:17.156 --> 24:20.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be basically made more
accessible to every
person.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have recreational
marijuana in Nevada,
Arizona.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are the big ones.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maine, Massachusetts, and, of
course, California.

24:28.267 --> 24:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while California stands kind
of above
the rest as a really significant
landmark

24:33.505 --> 24:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the tipping point idea, the
fact that
you have five other states, more
than we have

24:38.811 --> 24:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever seen on the ballot at the
same time,
considering the issue is an
indication that

24:42.448 --> 24:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this could be a really key year
for the policy.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another big issue
nationally -- it's
on the state ballot in a couple
places -- health

24:48.987 --> 24:50.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care and drug prices.

24:50.756 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, talk to us about, tell us
about what
California voters are being
asked to decide

24:55.861 --> 24:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on prescription drug costs.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MYERS: You know, I think,
you know, what
most people should need to know
about the

25:01.367 --> 25:06.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ballot measure here in
California, it's Proposition
61 on the statewide ballot next
week.

25:06.438 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, in a lot of ways, I would
argue, a
bit of a symbolic fight about
the cost of

25:10.676 --> 25:12.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prescription drugs.

25:12.411 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is simply a measure that says
that the
state government cannot pay a
price that is

25:16.715 --> 25:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher than what the federal
government pays
the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs when

25:20.819 --> 25:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it is buying prescription drugs.

25:24.289 --> 25:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the backers of it say
it will bring
some realistic -- bringing down,
perhaps,

25:29.661 --> 25:31.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the prices and some
transparency.

25:31.563 --> 25:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opponents, which is really
the pharmaceutical
industry, says it's going to
raise the cost

25:36.101 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of drug prices.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could for veterans and it
could for others.

25:39.304 --> 25:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is more than a $100 million
political
fight here in California.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The television ads, the
billboards -- I was
driving on the highway.

25:47.513 --> 25:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a yes-on-61 billboard
and then a
no-on-61 billboard within a mile
of each other.

25:52.951 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a knock-down, drag-out
fight.

25:54.820 --> 26:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect, again, it is seen as
a fight that
would be a proxy war for a
national discussion

26:00.459 --> 26:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the cost of prescription
drugs.

26:02.194 --> 26:06.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, Josh, in
Colorado, voters
are being asked to decide
another big issue

26:06.632 --> 26:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is being talked about again
with the
rising Obamacare premiums, a
single-payer

26:12.037 --> 26:13.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOSH ALTIC: Yes.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, ColoradoCare is on the
ballot here.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not nearly the nail-biter
that you
see in Prop 61.

26:20.045 --> 26:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have the support money
that you
kind of see in California.

26:25.451 --> 26:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That one is not very likely to
pass.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All the polls kind of point
towards it failing.

26:29.254 --> 26:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's still unique and very
significant
because it's the first of its
kind to really

26:33.425 --> 26:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
propose a statewide single-payer
health care
system like that through the
citizen initiative.

26:38.297 --> 26:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who knows kind of what doors
that could unlock
for future initiatives.

26:43.769 --> 26:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This one didn't seem to get the
support from
key Democrats and didn't seem to
get the money

26:48.507 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it needed to pass.

26:50.309 --> 26:54.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have the insurance
companies spending
enough to make it look like it's
not going

26:54.379 --> 26:55.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to pass.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact that you have it on
the ballot,
it's significant.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a first-of-its-kind
measure, for sure.

27:00.285 --> 27:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Gun control, a
perennial issue,
John, in California, voting on
ammunition,

27:06.859 --> 27:08.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on magazine size.

27:08.627 --> 27:13.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN MYERS: Yes, I mean,
California already
has pretty much more gun control
laws on the

27:13.465 --> 27:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
books than any other state.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're seen by that nationally.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This ballot measure, also backed
by the lieutenant
governor, Gavin Newsom, who
wants to be governor

27:20.706 --> 27:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2018 -- and I suspect that's
part of why
he's out there promoting these
-- but he also

27:24.276 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
says he cares about it.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Proposition 63 is the one you're
talking about.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would require background
checks for buying
ammunition.

27:31.617 --> 27:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would ban the sale of large
ammunition
clips.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It somewhat mirrors what the
state legislature
already did this year.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it has become a very big
issue.

27:41.460 --> 27:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, a lot of gun violence
incidents
we have seen across the country,
I think,

27:45.464 --> 27:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have played into this campaign.

27:47.366 --> 27:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, interestingly enough, you
have opposition
from the gun industry, from the
NRA as well,

27:52.070 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but you do not see a large
opposition political
campaign this election season.

27:56.742 --> 28:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in some ways, maybe they
have read the
polling numbers that
Californians appear poised

28:00.979 --> 28:02.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do this.

28:02.848 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there would be new and, I
think, interesting
policy choices about looking at
ammunition

28:07.519 --> 28:09.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not just the weapons
themselves.

28:09.288 --> 28:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Josh, of course,
former New
York Mayor Michael Bloomberg
trying to make

28:13.191 --> 28:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a push nationally on this.

28:15.894 --> 28:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What other states are we seeing
gun control
issues on the ballot?

28:19.298 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH ALTIC: Yes, he's spending a
lot of money
this year in Nevada and Maine
and Washington

28:26.104 --> 28:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sort of promote measures,
likewise, that
would increase the amount of
control the state

28:31.243 --> 28:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government has over guns.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, interestingly, you don't
see the NRA
fighting back as hard as you
might expect.

28:37.649 --> 28:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Maine and in Nevada, support
is outspending
opposition about 5-1.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's more money being
spent in Nevada.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, this is kind of a
big national
fight between Bloomberg and the
NRA.

28:49.595 --> 28:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far, more money has been
put forward
in support of these measures,
which is a bit

28:53.799 --> 28:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a surprise to some people.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're doing pretty well in the
polls as
well.

28:56.635 --> 29:02.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're looking at between six
and 10 points
in the most recent polls.

29:02.107 --> 29:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's looking pretty good for
the passage
of those measures.

And that could be a reason why
you don't see
as much money being spent by the
NRA.

JOHN YANG: Josh and John, lots
of issues to
talk about, and lots of issues
that we will

29:13.485 --> 29:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be talking about next week and
for the days
to come.

29:15.988 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN MYERS: Thank you.

29:19.091 --> 29:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, it's been
589 days
since the presidential campaign
began.

29:25.397 --> 29:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to get you through this last
week, Lisa
Desjardins has written an
election survival

29:30.469 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

29:31.470 --> 29:35.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can find that at
PBS.org/"NewsHour."

29:35.907 --> 29:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

29:43.649 --> 29:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
protests over
the Dakota oil pipeline near a
boiling point;

29:49.021 --> 29:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and new insights into some the
ocean's smallest
creatures.

29:53.725 --> 29:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: It's been more than
three months
since a coup sought to depose
the Turkish

29:58.397 --> 30:00.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

30:00.232 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attempt failed quickly, but
the crackdown
in its aftermath continues,
alarming many

30:04.369 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Turkey's allies.

30:09.174 --> 30:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Readers have opened Turkey's
main opposition
newspaper to find blank columns
this week,

30:14.312 --> 30:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a protest against jailing its
editor in chief
and a dozen staffers.

30:18.850 --> 30:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their arrests Monday were part
of an ongoing
purge against perceived
opponents by President

30:24.056 --> 30:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan since a
failed coup last
July.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, his prime minister
brushed off
European criticism.

30:30.729 --> 30:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): Today, somebody
from the European

30:34.733 --> 30:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament says the detention of
journalists
from that newspaper is a red
line.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brother, we don't care about
your red line.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the people who draw the red
line.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What importance does your line
have?

30:45.510 --> 30:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Across Turkey,
some 170
outlets have been shuttered
since July, leaving

30:51.650 --> 30:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2,500 journalists out of work.

30:53.518 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. State Department has
raised its concerns
repeatedly, as it did again
Monday.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State:
Suppressing speech and opinion
and the press

31:01.059 --> 31:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't support the fight
against terrorism
and only encroaches on the
fundamental freedoms

31:05.163 --> 31:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that help ensure democracies
remain strong.

31:07.733 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But silencing
Turkey's media
is only one facet of a crackdown
on anyone

31:13.105 --> 31:18.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
suspected of supporting
Fethullah Gulen, the
Islamic cleric whom Erdogan
accuses of fomenting

31:18.343 --> 31:19.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the coup attempt.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gulen lives in exile in
Pennsylvania.

31:22.114 --> 31:29.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A staggering 100,000 civil
servants have been
fired, including 10,000 more
just last weekend,

31:29.554 --> 31:33.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and 37,000 people have been
arrested.

31:33.859 --> 31:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Erdogan has even
voiced support
for reinstating the death
penalty, though

31:37.496 --> 31:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would dash hopes for Turkey's
European
Union membership bid.

31:41.633 --> 31:46.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, as he consolidates
his internal
power, the Turkish leader is
waging war along

31:46.738 --> 31:48.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his borders.

31:48.507 --> 31:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, Turkish tanks massed
at Silopi,
near the Iraqi frontier, to
press the fight

31:53.478 --> 31:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the Kurdish separatist
group known
as the PKK.

31:56.481 --> 32:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Southeastern Turkey is a largely
Kurdish region,
and the PKK maintains bases in
Northern Iraq.

32:02.087 --> 32:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Ankara, the defense minister
said there
is -- quote -- "no obligation to
wait for

32:07.025 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threats to rise."

32:08.894 --> 32:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FIKRI ISIK, Turkish Defense
Minister (through
translator): We have important
developments

32:11.863 --> 32:13.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the region.

32:13.732 --> 32:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a serious struggle
against terrorism
inside Turkey and on the other
side of the

32:17.669 --> 32:19.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

32:19.304 --> 32:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey is in the position of
making preparations
for all kinds of possibilities.

32:22.140 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, in Syria,
Turkish forces
are looking to retake the city
of al-Bab north

32:27.112 --> 32:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Aleppo from the Islamic
State.

32:29.681 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Success would also bar the city
to the Kurds,
who hope to close a 45-mile gap
between their

32:35.654 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enclaves and create a contiguous
Kurdish zone
along the Turkish frontier.

32:41.193 --> 32:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey also insists that Syrian
Kurdish forces
not be part of any campaign to
retake the

32:46.798 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic State's self-proclaimed
capital of
Raqqa in Syria.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All of this has strained
relations with Washington.

32:53.905 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration regards
the Kurds
as among its staunchest allies
against ISIS.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a closer look at this
recent crackdown
with Amberin Zaman.

33:03.315 --> 33:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is a Turkish journalist and
author and
serves as a fellow at the Wilson
Center, a

33:07.552 --> 33:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think tank in Washington.

33:09.087 --> 33:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, 10,000 more civil servants
just in the
past week that have been fired.

33:14.492 --> 33:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right after the coup, the
government said
this was to try and root out all
the Gulenists

33:19.030 --> 33:20.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the time.

33:20.131 --> 33:21.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why now?

33:21.132 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is this happening?

33:22.901 --> 33:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMBERIN ZAMAN, Wilson Center:
Well, as you
pointed out, the government has
justified

33:26.504 --> 33:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these moves on the grounds that
it's weeding
out the Gulenists, who they say
have penetrated

33:34.312 --> 33:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the entire government, the
judiciary, the
army, academia.

33:39.951 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at this point, when you
look at the scale
of this purge, you have more
than 100,000

33:46.791 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people now who have either lost
their jobs
or who are in jail, I think
around 30,000-plus

33:52.731 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now in jail.

33:54.532 --> 34:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look at the number of
journalists
also in jail, the number of
media outlets,

34:01.039 --> 34:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over 100, well over 100 now
shuttered.

34:04.309 --> 34:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's becoming very clear that
this is just
not about the Gulenists, but
more an effort

34:09.915 --> 34:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the part of the government to
stifle all
dissenting voices.

34:14.152 --> 34:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, as these
journalists
and their publications are
affected, is there

34:18.156 --> 34:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even a vehicle for people to
express dissent?

34:20.759 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMBERIN ZAMAN: Very good
question.

34:23.194 --> 34:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the newspapers that was
just sort of
raided on Monday, Cumhuriyet,
was pretty much

34:32.971 --> 34:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only opposition newspaper
that was still
around.

34:39.177 --> 34:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now it's facing this court
case.

34:44.349 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifteen journalists from the
newspaper, including
its managing editor, are now in
prison.

34:51.489 --> 34:59.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, actually, there's
practically nothing
left, just a handful of online
media outlets

34:59.197 --> 35:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that still struggle to offer an
alternative
view.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what's the
mood on the
street like?

35:05.804 --> 35:10.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How are Turkish people reacting
to this act
that they're witnessing over a
period of months

35:10.942 --> 35:12.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

35:12.777 --> 35:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMBERIN ZAMAN: Well, when we
talk about this
massive crackdown and pressure
on the media,

35:16.548 --> 35:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
et cetera, what often isn't
mentioned is the
fact that there are a
significant amount of

35:21.419 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who actually support the
government,
who support President Erdogan.

35:26.324 --> 35:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just saw a recent opinion poll
that showed
that his popularity, if
anything, is rising,

35:32.797 --> 35:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that some 54 percent of the
people approve
of the way he's running the
country.

35:38.269 --> 35:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that needs to be, you know,
said.

35:42.307 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the country is deeply
polarized between
those who, you know, almost
adore, let's say,

35:48.413 --> 35:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president -- there's a cult
of personality
around him -- and then those
who, you know,

35:54.085 --> 36:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bitterly oppose him, but who
also happen to
be bitterly divided amongst
themselves, which

36:00.325 --> 36:06.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is why there's no really
effective opposition
against the government, against
the president.

36:06.431 --> 36:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, while he
might have
great support internally,
externally, forces

36:09.901 --> 36:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the U.S. and the E.U. are
finding concerns
with some of these actions.

36:14.005 --> 36:18.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How does this affect his
standing in NATO
or the E.U., or potentially in
the E.U.?

36:18.109 --> 36:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMBERIN ZAMAN: Well, at the
moment, people
in Brussels and this capital,
Washington,

36:25.817 --> 36:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are observing Turkey with
increasing alarm,
because Turkey seems to be
increasingly erratic,

36:32.424 --> 36:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unpredictable in its actions.

36:34.926 --> 36:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, Turkey is talking
about intervening
militarily in Iraq.

36:40.532 --> 36:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already done so in Syria,
admittedly,
to fight the Islamic State, and
it has, indeed,

36:47.272 --> 36:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cleared its borders of the
Islamic State.

36:49.641 --> 36:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, in Syria,
it's attacking
the United States' most
effective ally in

36:56.915 --> 36:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fight against the Islamic
State.

36:58.783 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm talking about the Syrian
Kurdish group
called the YPG.

37:02.954 --> 37:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's complicating efforts
to sort of,
you know, destroy the Islamic
State in Syria.

37:11.596 --> 37:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at a time when, you know,
there's now
this critical operation under
way in Mosul,

37:17.168 --> 37:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey is now talking about
going into Iraq.

37:21.339 --> 37:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's engaged, the president, in
a very public
spat with the Iraqi prime
minister, Haider

37:27.312 --> 37:29.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Abadi.

37:29.080 --> 37:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, Turkey moved
several hundred
troops into Iraq last December,
saying that

37:35.453 --> 37:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were there to train Sunni
militia, but
also to act as a deterrent
against Shia militias.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is making everything a
lot more complicated.

37:46.865 --> 37:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Amberin Zaman
from the Wilson Center, thanks
for joining

37:54.072 --> 37:55.273 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

37:55.306 --> 38:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMBERIN ZAMAN: Thank you.

38:00.278 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In North Dakota,
the standoff
over the controversial Dakota
Access pipeline

38:07.719 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeps growing, as riot police
cleared protesters
blocking the pipeline's
construction.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the latest.

38:15.827 --> 38:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the past
week, at least
140 people were arrested while
occupying land

38:20.665 --> 38:25.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the pipeline's path,
including one woman
charged with allegedly shooting
at police.

38:25.203 --> 38:26.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one was injured.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Native Americans and
environmentalists say
the pipeline will destroy sacred
sites and

38:30.875 --> 38:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threaten the drinking water of
the Standing
Rock Sioux Tribe.

38:34.012 --> 38:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 1,200-mile-long, nearly $4
billion pipeline
would carry 500,000 gallons of
crude oil daily

38:40.919 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across four states.

38:42.754 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, President Obama
weighed in on the
fight in an interview with the
Web site Now

38:46.090 --> 38:47.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This News.

38:47.892 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
There's an obligation for
protesters to be

38:51.129 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
peaceful.

38:52.897 --> 38:57.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's an obligation for
authorities
to show restraint.

38:57.335 --> 39:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to make sure that, as
everybody
is exercising their
constitutional rights

39:04.509 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be heard, that both sides are
refraining
from situations that might
result in people

39:11.649 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being hurt.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
this, I'm joined
now by Seattle Times reporter
Lynda Mapes,

39:16.788 --> 39:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's just back from North
Dakota.

39:18.323 --> 39:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lynda, thank you so much for
being here.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Could you just tell us, what has
it been like?

39:23.094 --> 39:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You were just there recently.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is it like?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you see?

39:26.631 --> 39:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNDA MAPES, The Seattle Times:
Well, it was
scary, honestly.

39:28.433 --> 39:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was there with a Seattle Times
photographer,
Ellen Banner, and we truly were
wondering

39:32.270 --> 39:34.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minute to minute whether someone
was going
to get killed.

39:34.973 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were in camp the night before
with tribal
members who were singing their
death songs.

39:39.410 --> 39:42.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they were very worried
about the possibility
of violence.

39:42.947 --> 39:44.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And who wouldn't be?

39:44.882 --> 39:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have seen law enforcement
marshaled from
six states, armored personnel
carriers, hundreds

39:50.054 --> 39:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hundreds of law enforcement
officers with
concussion grenades, mace,
Tasers, batons.

39:57.528 --> 39:58.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they used all of it.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it was frightening to
watch.

40:00.431 --> 40:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And when you
say that they
were using this, can you sort of
describe

40:03.601 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation in which -- we
tend to see images
of riots or protests, and we
think of an equal

40:09.807 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clash between both sides.

40:11.476 --> 40:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kinds of things did you
witness?

40:12.744 --> 40:15.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LYNDA MAPES: Well, the
demonstrators are vastly
outnumbered.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no question about that.

40:17.915 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in many cases, they were
literally sitting,
arms locked, praying when they
were arrested.

40:23.321 --> 40:26.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This changed as the standoff
went on.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It all started on Thursday
morning around
10:30.

40:28.693 --> 40:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went on all through the day,
all through
the night, into the next day.

40:32.563 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the next day, Friday
morning, demonstrators
had burned two trucks on a
bridge and had

40:38.036 --> 40:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
erected a makeshift plywood
barrier.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They had a pile of rocks.

40:42.874 --> 40:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the law enforcement
officers had
advance more than 100 yards with
five armored

40:48.579 --> 40:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personnel carriers side by side,
hundreds
of law enforcement officers
advancing on them.

40:54.519 --> 41:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it finally took an elder to
actually walk
by himself in between the two
lines, stand

41:00.158 --> 41:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there, face his people, and say:
"Go home.

41:03.828 --> 41:08.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're here to fight the
pipeline, not these
people, and we can only win this
with prayer."

41:08.533 --> 41:13.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A lot of
people have been
making the comparison in recent
days with

41:13.237 --> 41:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happened with the armed
white militiamen
who were just acquitted recently
of taking

41:17.909 --> 41:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over a federal wildlife refuge
in Oregon.

41:20.878 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they say white protesters
with weapons
are acquitted, while largely
peaceful Indians

41:28.519 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
protesting are not.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were there when the jury --
that acquittal
came down.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you hear from people
there?

41:34.292 --> 41:35.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LYNDA MAPES: People were
stunned.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were shocked.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They were hurt.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were confused.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I heard a lot of, how can this
possibly be?

41:42.767 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the subtext being, of
course, "Well, of
course.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're Indians."

41:47.205 --> 41:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People were very, very hurt by
the juxtaposition
of these two events.

41:50.308 --> 41:53.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we heard
also, President
Obama just weighed in on this,
asking everybody

41:53.945 --> 42:00.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to cool down, and also
suggesting that maybe
the pipeline should be rerouted
away from

42:00.651 --> 42:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Standing Rock Tribe and the
Missouri River,
where they get their drinking
water.

42:04.422 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that were to happen, if the
pipe was rerouted,
do you think that that would
settle things

42:08.493 --> 42:10.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down?

42:10.228 --> 42:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNDA MAPES: The chairman of the
Standing
Rock Sioux Tribe said days ago,
look, there's

42:13.464 --> 42:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a peaceful outcome to this that
could make
everyone happy.

42:17.735 --> 42:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't bring it right to our
reservation.

42:19.504 --> 42:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't put it within 10 miles of
our drinking
water intake.

42:22.840 --> 42:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Move it, and, meanwhile, put all
these out-of-work
people back to work retrofitting
the existing

42:28.146 --> 42:30.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pipelines underneath the
Missouri River.

42:30.515 --> 42:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was very clear that they're
not against
energy and development.

42:34.852 --> 42:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're worried about is
pollution of
their drinking water source and
the drinking

42:39.290 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water of millions of people
downstream, as
well as desecration of their
sacred sites.

42:43.795 --> 42:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you have
any sense of
where this goes from here?

42:47.298 --> 42:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, President Obama has
weighed in
on this and made his point
known.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have an election coming
up.

42:52.537 --> 42:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know -- just give me a
sense of,
what do you believe is going to
happen going

42:56.140 --> 42:57.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down the road?

42:57.408 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNDA MAPES: Boy, I honestly
think anything
could happen.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very scary situation.

43:02.780 --> 43:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The police and the demonstrators
are going
at it as you and I sit here.

43:06.651 --> 43:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demonstrators this morning
were building
a little wooden bridge across a
creek to try

43:10.288 --> 43:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get back to the treaty camp
to defend that
land from the pipeline.

43:15.226 --> 43:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to a Yakama Nation
tribal member
who was coming in from Bismarck,
and he saw

43:19.897 --> 43:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two Apache helicopters on the
ground at the
airport and more and more police
coming from

43:23.835 --> 43:25.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all over.

43:25.570 --> 43:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the president has said
he wants this
to play out for a couple more
weeks.

43:29.907 --> 43:30.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

43:30.908 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I truly wonder what will
happen next.

43:33.744 --> 43:35.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tensions are very high.

43:35.580 --> 43:40.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the energy company, they
have said that
their contracts were inked in
2014, when oil

43:40.084 --> 43:41.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prices were still good.

43:41.853 --> 43:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have since dropped, and if
they don't
get this thing built by the end
of the year,

43:45.156 --> 43:46.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those contracts expire.

43:46.891 --> 43:50.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in January, they would have
to take a
whole other look at whether this
thing even

43:50.428 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pencils.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could effectively cancel
their project,
which is why they're pushing so
hard to finish

43:55.032 --> 43:56.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this thing.

43:56.801 --> 44:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tribe and all of their
supporters,
tribal and non, are also pushing
back just

44:00.371 --> 44:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as hard, because, to them, it is
literally
a battle of life and death.

44:04.609 --> 44:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Lynda Mapes of
The Seattle Times, thank you so
much.

44:07.712 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LYNDA MAPES: Thank you.

44:12.917 --> 44:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a new
effort to shed
light on a mystery that has long
baffled scientists

44:25.897 --> 44:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who study the world's oceans and
waterways.

44:28.799 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers are using some very
sophisticated
robots to understand what's
happening with

44:33.204 --> 44:35.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
microscopic marine life.

44:35.573 --> 44:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has the story,
part of our weekly series
covering the Leading

44:39.076 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Edge of science and technology.

44:42.647 --> 44:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: At the Crab Cove
Visitors Center
in Alameda, California, the main
attraction

44:49.186 --> 44:50.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is, no surprise, crabs.

44:50.421 --> 44:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's pointed, right?

44:51.689 --> 44:53.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that means it's a...

44:53.257 --> 44:55.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Male.

44:55.059 --> 44:58.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: On a recent afternoon,
a group of
children on a field trip at the
center headed

44:58.629 --> 45:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside to the nearby beach with
naturalist
Morgan Dill for a talk on the
creatures of

45:03.834 --> 45:05.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the cove.

45:05.469 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORGAN DILL, Naturalist, East
Bay Regional
Park District: We have got
clams.

45:07.071 --> 45:08.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have got oysters.

45:08.072 --> 45:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would you like to see a crab's
baby picture?

45:10.474 --> 45:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the cute little baby
crab.

45:15.046 --> 45:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is their larval stage,
and they go
through this stage and they're
out there,

45:19.951 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we don't actually know too
much about
them, but this is their baby
picture.

45:23.721 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Dill's lesson
highlighted a gap
in her and other scientists'
otherwise detailed

45:28.559 --> 45:30.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knowledge of the crab's life
cycle.

45:30.328 --> 45:33.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORGAN DILL: Sometimes, when you
flip them
over, they have actually got
eggs on their

45:33.531 --> 45:34.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abdomen.

45:34.865 --> 45:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're holding them there,
and there's
hundreds of eggs.

45:37.835 --> 45:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, often, the kids will
say, OK, so
where do they go from there?

45:42.673 --> 45:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We tell them they go back out
into the bay,
but we don't really know how
long they're

45:46.677 --> 45:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out there, when they're coming
back, and are
they at the whim of the current
or not?

45:50.815 --> 45:54.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The answers to those
questions have
long been a mystery to those who
study the

45:54.919 --> 45:56.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oceans.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But it's not just the
whereabouts of baby
crabs that's perplexing.

45:59.423 --> 46:04.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 70 percent of all
marine organisms
start out life as tiny
microscopic larvae,

46:04.929 --> 46:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creatures like sea urchins,
anemones, lobsters,
shrimp, and a wide variety of
fish.

46:10.401 --> 46:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many look like little aliens.

46:12.336 --> 46:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN, University of
California, Davis:
We know so little about this
life stage because

46:16.240 --> 46:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's so incredibly difficult to
study.

46:18.876 --> 46:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Steven Morgan is a
professor marine
ecology at the University of
California at

46:24.148 --> 46:25.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

46:25.983 --> 46:28.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morgan has spent most of his
career trying
to figure out what happens to
marine larvae

46:28.219 --> 46:30.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before they become adults and
are easier to
track.

46:30.955 --> 46:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: On land, we can
radio track
mountain lions by putting
collars on them

46:37.194 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and their offspring, and so we
know exactly
what's happening to populations.

46:42.133 --> 46:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the sea, imagine trying
to follow this
microscopic larval stage for
weeks and months

46:50.074 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the plankton while it's
developing.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't do that.

46:54.478 --> 46:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The conventional
wisdom in his field,
says Morgan, has been that the
larvae float

46:57.948 --> 47:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passively in the big turbulent
ocean, and
it's sheer luck if they are able
to stay near

47:02.520 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shore or at certain depths that
they prefer.

47:05.089 --> 47:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: People tend to
think of them
as larvae being carried by
currents, much

47:11.729 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a dandelion seed on the
wind, and they
have little control over where
they're going.

47:18.235 --> 47:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But Morgan never
bought into that
theory, and in recent years, he
and a small

47:22.239 --> 47:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of other scientists
around the country
have done tests in labs that
show the larvae

47:26.844 --> 47:30.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can in fact control their
movements more than
previously thought.

47:30.181 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out that they are
pretty good at
swimming up and down in the
water column.

47:34.318 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: Did you see a
difference in
the swimming patterns between
the species?

47:38.756 --> 47:42.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But what do those up
and down movements
mean for them when they are in
the ocean?

47:42.560 --> 47:46.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they showing us they do have
some control
over their fate?

47:46.363 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To figure that out, Morgan has
enlisted the
help of some cute, but very
sophisticated

47:50.601 --> 47:52.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
robots.

47:52.536 --> 47:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the past two years, Morgan
and his colleagues
have been deploying swarms of
these devices,

47:56.974 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affectionately called larvae
bots, off the
coast of Northern California.

48:01.011 --> 48:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are programmed to mimic the
larvaes'
up and down behaviors as the
float freely

48:05.483 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the water.

48:06.884 --> 48:10.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their buoyancy is controlled by
an internal
bladder filled with oil.

48:10.054 --> 48:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are packed full of
instruments, sensors
and a GPS tracking system.

48:15.926 --> 48:19.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal of this research, which
is funded
by the National Science
Foundation, also a

48:19.864 --> 48:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" funder, is to find
out where the
larvae bots are going and how
they manage

48:23.934 --> 48:25.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get there.

48:25.770 --> 48:30.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: This is a new
information that
hasn't -- hadn't really existed
up until now.

48:30.241 --> 48:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're sort of cracking the
black box of
larval behavior.

48:33.944 --> 48:39.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In fact, data coming
back from the
larvae bots shows that they stay
remarkably

48:39.116 --> 48:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close to shore when programmed
to go up and
down at certain times of day.

48:43.320 --> 48:46.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what Morgan thinks
many of the
larvae are doing too.

48:46.056 --> 48:50.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They seem to know how to use
currents and
tides to go generally where they
want.

48:50.995 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: The one way that
they can actually
have some control over where
they're going

48:56.367 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their destinies is actually
to move vertically
between currents that are
stratified, moving

49:03.274 --> 49:05.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in opposite directions.

49:05.109 --> 49:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they can simply just
regulate their
amount of time in surface and
bottom currents,

49:11.248 --> 49:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then that will determine how far
offshore
and along shore they're actually
going.

49:15.886 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The concept of
larvae-mimicking
robots actually came about more
than 20 years

49:21.158 --> 49:27.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ago from two now retired
professors at North
Carolina State University, Tom
and Donna Wolcott.

49:27.398 --> 49:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steven Morgan met them and at a
conference
, and a partnership ensued.

49:30.434 --> 49:36.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The robots are assembled back in
North Carolina,
and then shipped to the U.C.
Davis Marine

49:36.407 --> 49:41.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lab in Bodega Bay, where
principal marine
electronics technician Grant
Susner gets them

49:41.512 --> 49:43.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ready to go to sea.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT SUSNER, University of
California, Davis:
These robots are made by --
their external

49:45.916 --> 49:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
housing is a fire extinguisher.

49:47.551 --> 49:50.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We repurposed and recycled some
old ones that
they had around.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Fire extinguisher.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GRANT SUSNER: Yes.

49:52.323 --> 49:53.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CAT WISE: Wow.

49:54.024 --> 49:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you may have noticed, they
aren't exactly
the same size as microscopic
larvae.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Susner says it doesn't
actually make much
of a difference.

49:59.864 --> 50:05.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT SUSNER: The key feature of
this robot
is that we have programmed it,
its behavior,

50:05.302 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to mimic the speed at which the
larvae travel
as well.

50:08.606 --> 50:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this isn't going to travel
any faster
than larvae does.

50:11.642 --> 50:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: While the robots seem
to be revealing
clues about the larvaes'
behavior, the question

50:16.747 --> 50:20.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains, why does it actually
matter if, in
fact, the larvae are better
navigators?

50:20.784 --> 50:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I posed that question to a man
who would really
like to know where they are
going.

50:24.521 --> 50:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DOUROS, Regional Director,
NOAA National
Marine Sanctuaries: Knowing that
information

50:26.423 --> 50:28.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a big deal.

50:28.292 --> 50:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There'd be a lot of benefits to
us from a
science standpoint, as well as
from a management

50:32.229 --> 50:34.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standpoint.

50:34.164 --> 50:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Bill Douros is the
West Coast regional
director for NOAA's Office of
National Marine

50:37.301 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sanctuaries.

50:39.203 --> 50:43.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Douros says it's difficult to
manage and protect
diverse populations of marine
life without

50:43.407 --> 50:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knowing where the youngsters
are.

50:45.276 --> 50:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DOUROS: The state of
California and federal
fishery managers have made
decisions about

50:49.580 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where to place no-fishing areas
along the
coast of California.

50:53.150 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many of these are inside
national marine sanctuaries.

50:55.619 --> 51:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the scientists that advise
on that make
their best educated advice.

51:00.524 --> 51:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they don't know precisely
how big the
marine protected areas should
be.

51:04.628 --> 51:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we knew better where the
larvae go after
they're released, we might
better design and

51:10.401 --> 51:16.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may shrink even some no-fishing
areas and
no-take areas that are set up to
protect abalone

51:16.140 --> 51:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and crabs and other parts of the
ecosystem.

51:18.075 --> 51:22.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: He also says that
larval movements
can impact much larger species.

51:22.446 --> 51:26.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DOUROS: The larvae, which
are part of
this plankton food chain,
ultimately predict

51:26.884 --> 51:28.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where whales are going to be.

51:28.619 --> 51:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we knew where the whales were
going to
be in the next three days, we
might reroute

51:32.356 --> 51:37.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ship traffic to separate whales
from ships,
so that they don't get struck by
ships.

51:37.761 --> 51:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: For his part, Steven
Morgan knows
that his research and
conclusions might still

51:42.599 --> 51:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a tough sell for many of his
fellow marine
scientists.

51:45.769 --> 51:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MORGAN: I'm hoping that
these robots,
where we're actually doing
experiments in

51:51.608 --> 51:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ocean, will convince some of
the skeptics
and get more people, more
investigators in

51:57.982 --> 52:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marine science to think that
way, because
it's a hugely important
question.

52:03.320 --> 52:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Back at Crab Cove,
naturalist Morgan
Dill and a group of curious kids
are hoping

52:08.225 --> 52:11.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they soon can get some answers
for their important
questions.

52:11.328 --> 52:14.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
