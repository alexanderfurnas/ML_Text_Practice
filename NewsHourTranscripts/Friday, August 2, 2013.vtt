YOU LOOK NOT JUST AT THE --

UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURE IS DOWN A
LITTLE BIT.
BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

36:44.065 --> 36:45.660
LITTLE BIT.
BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.025
BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE.
THE DISCOURAGED WORKERS, THE

36:47.027 --> 36:49.122
TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE.
THE DISCOURAGED WORKERS, THE
LESS -- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST

36:49.124 --> 36:50.055

LESS -- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST
STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK.

HARD AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO, AS
MANY HOURS AS THEY'D LIKE TO.

36:55.285 --> 36:59.576
HARD AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO, AS
MANY HOURS AS THEY'D LIKE TO.
THAT'S 14% OF THE LABOR FORCE.

36:59.579 --> 37:00.942
MANY HOURS AS THEY'D LIKE TO.
THAT'S 14% OF THE LABOR FORCE.
I THINK DAVID'S TOTALLY RIGHT

37:00.944 --> 37:02.441
THAT'S 14% OF THE LABOR FORCE.
I THINK DAVID'S TOTALLY RIGHT
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE NEED

WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE NEED
TO SORT OF GET TO SOME REALLY
STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS.

37:06.004 --> 37:07.669
TO SORT OF GET TO SOME REALLY
STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS.
AND THE THING THAT'S SO

37:07.671 --> 37:08.699
STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS.
AND THE THING THAT'S SO
DISAPPOINTING IS THAT WE'RE

37:08.701 --> 37:10.898
AND THE THING THAT'S SO
DISAPPOINTING IS THAT WE'RE
LOOKING AT A POLITICAL SYSTEM

37:10.900 --> 37:12.495
DISAPPOINTING IS THAT WE'RE
LOOKING AT A POLITICAL SYSTEM
THAT DOESN'T SEEM CAPABLE OF

MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS TO AGREE
TO CUT SPENDING THAT MUCH.

42:15.079 --> 42:16.974
MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS TO AGREE
