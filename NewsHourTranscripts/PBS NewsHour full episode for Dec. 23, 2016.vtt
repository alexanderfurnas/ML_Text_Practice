defending Israel at the United
Nations by using the U.S.
veto to squash resolutions

01:22.433 --> 01:26.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, instead, the

Israeli government and
President-elect Trump.

01:30.233 --> 01:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

must stop privately and publicly
for nearly five decades.

01:51.767 --> 01:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

both the issue and

from naive and foolish
to flat-out reckless."

02:23.633 --> 02:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump who had
urged the White House to veto
the resolution tweeted that,

Let it be an arms race.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will match them
at every turn?

03:22.733 --> 03:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPICER: There's not going to
be 'cause he's going to ensure

message that he's not going
to sit back and allow that.

03:26.767 --> 03:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's going to happen is,
they will come to their senses,

03:30.800 --> 03:35.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

04:13.167 --> 04:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

new here.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

04:22.933 --> 04:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing unusual.

04:24.900 --> 04:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

adopt.

05:04.767 --> 05:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Anis Amri, the suspect of the

09:05.633 --> 09:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are trying to blame external

09:08.533 --> 09:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

09:12.567 --> 09:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In my opinion, it

09:14.000 --> 09:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

10:02.033 --> 10:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
rose a fraction of a percent.

10:05.633 --> 10:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still to come on the
"NewsHour": why the U.S.
broke a longstanding
practice of protecting

10:13.100 --> 10:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel at the U.N.; what
to make of the president-
elect's nuclear arms
comments; a new Ebola

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vaccine that's 100 percent
effective, and much more.

10:24.967 --> 10:28.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

10:28.200 --> 10:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, why did the Obama
administration abstain from
voting on the United Nations

10:39.300 --> 10:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Council resolution
condemning Israeli
settlements in the West
Bank and East Jerusalem?

10:46.267 --> 10:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We ask Ben Rhodes, deputy
national security advisor for
strategic communications to the

10:51.000 --> 10:51.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ben Rhodes, welcome.

10:53.933 --> 10:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the case that the U.S.
has long opposed these Israeli
settlements but, at the same

10:59.967 --> 11:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, it has protected Israel
in the U.N. against these
condemning resolutions.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why the shift?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR: Well, look,
first of all, it's bipartisan

11:09.733 --> 11:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tradition to opposed
settlements, as you mentioned.

11:12.333 --> 11:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been many resolutions
in the past under bipartisan
administrations that address

11:17.000 --> 11:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Arab-Israeli conflict.

11:19.533 --> 11:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter
is, we vetoed a resolution
that addressed settlements
in 2011, and look

11:23.733 --> 11:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's happened since.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've had failed peace processes
after failed peace process,
and the pace of settlement

11:28.600 --> 11:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction has
accelerated significantly.

11:31.267 --> 11:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just recently, you
had the Israeli prime
minister saying that this
is the most pro-settlement

11:35.633 --> 11:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in administration in Israeli
history, the Israeli government
that is currently in place.

11:39.267 --> 11:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We believe that at this
pace, a two-state solution
could be put at risk.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We believe that would
be profoundly bad for
Israel and its security.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, that's why the president
took the position that he did.

11:49.967 --> 11:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: It comes across,
though, Ben Rhodes, though, as
a parting shot at Israel on the

11:54.133 --> 11:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of President Obama.

11:56.300 --> 12:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHODES: Well, look, we have a
record that we'll put up next
to anybody in terms of support

12:01.900 --> 12:04.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Israel.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we just concluded
a $38 billion ten year
MOU with respect to
their security assistance

12:08.667 --> 12:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the United States.

12:10.700 --> 12:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact of the matter is,
though, I think if you look at
the map of the West Bank, if

12:14.033 --> 12:18.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look at the future of
the two-state solution,
these settlements are
encroaching further

12:18.167 --> 12:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and further beyond the
separation barrier that
the Israelis themselves
built, thousands

12:22.733 --> 12:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of new settlements are being
constructed and, frankly, if
these trends continue, it will

12:27.367 --> 12:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be impossible to realize
a two-state solution.

12:30.333 --> 12:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the fact of the matter
is, we can't just have a peace
process or a two-state solution

12:34.000 --> 12:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as an empty talking point.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we really want to be able
to have a prospect for peace,
we have to be clear about what

12:40.533 --> 12:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're against and that includes
the type of settlements and
I'd say as the resolution

12:47.667 --> 12:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
points out, the type of
incitement to violence
on the Palestinian side
that have been obstacles

12:50.400 --> 12:52.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to peace.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
read you what - - among other
things the comments from Prime

12:54.967 --> 12:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Minister Netanyahu
after this happened.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "The National Security
Council has disgracefully
ganged up on the one democracy

13:03.400 --> 13:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Middle East."

13:05.400 --> 13:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Israeli government is
saying this was a shameful
resolution, they're not going

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to abide by it.

13:14.933 --> 13:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHODES: Look, we've taken a lot
of criticism from the Israeli
government over the years.

13:28.533 --> 13:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at our record,
unprecedented military
intelligence cooperation,
a significant security

13:34.500 --> 13:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assistance upgrades.

13:36.533 --> 13:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But again, let's talk about
what the resolution addressed
-- the settlement construction.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the conversation
that the Israeli
government is not having.

13:42.700 --> 13:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, you had this
prime minister say this is the
most pro-settlement Israeli

13:48.433 --> 13:50.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government in history.

13:50.967 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frankly, that statement
is entirely inconsistent
with the two-state
solution that the Israeli

13:56.233 --> 13:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government in the past has
said they supported, that many
members of Congress support.

13:58.367 --> 14:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a certain point, we all
just have to stop and look at
the map and look at the facts

14:02.267 --> 14:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say, if these settlements
continue, is the two-state
solution impossible?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that clearly
is the trend line.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's evident for everybody
to see, and that's what we
should be talking about.

14:12.600 --> 14:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: President-elect Trump,
as you know, had urged the White
House to veto this resolution

14:18.467 --> 14:20.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
condemning Israel.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that he was in
touch with the president of
Egypt to try to intervene.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was this appropriate
on his part?

14:25.800 --> 14:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RHODES: Well, look, we
believe that there is
one president at a time.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, after January
20, the president-elect
will get to pursue this
approach and whatever

14:34.700 --> 14:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other one he wants
on these issues.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I would say, it's very
important, this is bipartisan
position to oppose continued

14:43.433 --> 14:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
settlements and it's a
bipartisan history that there'd
been resolutions at the U.N.

14:47.033 --> 14:49.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I keep hearing this
is unprecedented.

14:49.167 --> 14:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were six resolutions under
George W. Bush addressed the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

14:54.067 --> 14:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including one that embraced the
road map the Bush administration
put forward for a Palestinian

14:58.700 --> 15:00.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state by 2005.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was over a decade ago.

15:02.833 --> 15:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the question is, if we are
against the continued settlement
activity and for a two-state

15:07.133 --> 15:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solution, why are we going
to continue with the status
quo, on which we see trends on

15:14.100 --> 15:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
both sides, Israeli
and Palestinian trends,
that are putting peace
farther and farther

15:16.833 --> 15:18.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away?

15:18.900 --> 15:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: You say it's
bipartisan, but as you
very well know, the
leadership -- Republican

15:21.033 --> 15:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership in the Congress is
raining down now with criticism,
the incoming Democratic

15:28.433 --> 15:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader in the Senate, Senator
Schumer from New York, is
criticizing this decision.

15:35.433 --> 15:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It sounds like the
administration is, if
not alone, certainly is
in the minority on this

15:41.633 --> 15:43.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position today.

15:43.600 --> 15:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHODES: Well, look, we respect,
of course, friends on both
sides of the aisle who have

15:50.433 --> 15:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expressed different
views on this.

15:52.533 --> 15:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I think the question is
going to be when history looks
at these types of decisions,

15:59.633 --> 16:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people look back and
they say, you saw tens of
thousands of settlements
being constructed,

16:04.833 --> 16:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you saw as was addressed in
the resolution, incitement to
violence on the Palestinian

16:08.633 --> 16:10.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, do we not have
responsibility to lay down a
marker here about what we think

16:15.367 --> 16:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is actual U.S. policy?

16:17.500 --> 16:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a resolution like this
that is entirely consistent with
the policy, how can we continue

16:20.900 --> 16:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to veto that over
and over again?

16:22.900 --> 16:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Finally, are you
comfortable -- is the president
comfortable with this knowing

16:26.233 --> 16:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that President-elect Trump is
saying he's going to undo this
as soon as he takes office

16:31.833 --> 16:32.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a few weeks?

16:32.633 --> 16:37.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it worth it?

16:40.300 --> 16:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Ben Rhodes, deputy
national security advisor to
the president -- thank you very

17:06.100 --> 17:09.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RHODES: Thank you.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

17:20.633 --> 17:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: We return now to
President-elect Trump's comments
about the need to build up

17:27.633 --> 17:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the United States'
nuclear arsenal -- and
to John Yang for that.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

17:33.367 --> 17:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Are the president- elect's
tweets and comments signaling
a change in U.S. nuclear

17:37.300 --> 17:38.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapons policy?

17:38.800 --> 17:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And should the nation beef
up its nuclear arsenal?

17:41.300 --> 17:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Matthew
Kroenig, an associate
professor at Georgetown
University who's written

17:48.300 --> 17:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extensively about nuclear
weapons, and Joseph
Cirincione, the president
of the Ploughshares

17:53.000 --> 17:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fund, a non-profit organization
that advocates for disarmament.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He, too, has written
widely on the subject.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both
for joining us tonight.

18:01.233 --> 18:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Cirincione, let me start
with you, when you hear or
read the president-elect saying

18:08.200 --> 18:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the United States must
greatly strengthen and expand
its nuclear capability and then

18:14.567 --> 18:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell Mika Brzezinski this
morning, "Let it be an arms
race," what's your reaction?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSEPH CIRINCIONE,
PLOUGHSHARES FUND: Stunned.

18:19.067 --> 18:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An ill-considered,
disrespectful and dangerous
series of statements.

18:23.267 --> 18:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This would upend decades of
Republican and Democratic policy
that ever since Ronald Reagan

18:30.200 --> 18:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been reducing nuclear
arsenals, both in the United
States and Russia and around the

18:34.900 --> 18:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world, stopping other countries
from getting nuclear weapons.

18:37.833 --> 18:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By using that word
"expand", he says he wants
to grow the arsenal or
grow the capabilities.

18:44.233 --> 18:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, nobody is against keeping
a strong nuclear deterrent.

18:47.033 --> 18:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If that's all he said, we
wouldn't be having this debate.

18:49.967 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has put
in train a trillion-dollar
program to replace every
single nuclear weapon

18:56.467 --> 18:58.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have over the next 25 years.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump seems to be saying
he wants to go ahead with this.

19:01.800 --> 19:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His advisors tried to walk it
back, but he himself said this
morning, let it be an arms

19:07.767 --> 19:09.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is an extremely dangerous
posture, that's why people
all over the globe are worried

19:12.900 --> 19:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and talking about this today.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: Matthew Kroenig,
what's your take?

19:16.467 --> 19:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW KROENIG, GEORGETOWN
UNIVERSITY: Well, the statement
is certainly controversial but

19:18.567 --> 19:21.067 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think Trump is
basically right.

19:21.067 --> 19:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. nuclear policy in
the U.S. can't be static,
it has to respond to
international politics

19:28.367 --> 19:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all America's nuclear
armed rivals, Russia,
China, North Korea, are
expanding and modernizing

19:31.733 --> 19:34.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their arsenals.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it doesn't make sense
for the United States
to continue reducing its
arsenal as our adversaries

19:36.767 --> 19:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are going in the
other directions.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And moreover, many of
these countries, especially
Russia, are relying
more not less on nuclear

19:42.733 --> 19:44.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weapons in their strategy.

19:44.667 --> 19:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, again, the United States
needs to take that into account
as it formulates its own

19:48.233 --> 19:50.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear posture.

19:50.333 --> 19:53.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, I think some
strengthening of U.S.
nuclear strategy and
U.S. nuclear posture

19:53.367 --> 19:55.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been long overdue.

19:55.367 --> 19:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Matthew Kroenig, when you
say the United States shouldn't
be reducing its arsenal,

20:01.600 --> 20:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but isn't that what's
called for under an
existing treaty with Russia?

20:04.200 --> 20:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KROENIG: Well, the existing
treaty with Russia, the new
START treaty was signed in 2011.

20:09.100 --> 20:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the treaty,
both countries can
have 1,550 deployed
strategic nuclear weapons.

20:16.033 --> 20:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the United States
is actually well under
200 or so warheads under.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Russians are
250 warheads above.

20:21.267 --> 20:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a gap of
about 400 warheads that's
worrying in and of itself,
and it raises questions

20:27.900 --> 20:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about Russia -- whether
Russia actually intends
to follow through on
this agreement or not.

20:30.933 --> 20:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is one of the measures
that a new president can
take to strengthen America's

20:34.267 --> 20:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear arsenal to increase
the size of the arsenal, at
least to the limits allowed for

20:37.767 --> 20:38.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under new START.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YANG: You're shaking your head.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CIRINCIONE: Well, that's because
he's playing with numbers.

20:42.833 --> 20:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, it's true, we both
have about 7,000 warheads
in our total inventory
and the ones that the

20:48.533 --> 20:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treaty counts, you know,
we're a couple hundred under.

20:52.133 --> 20:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have more
launchers, more missiles,
more delivery vehicles.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're a couple hundred over
where the Russians are.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But at these levels, those
numbers don't matter.

21:00.633 --> 21:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We both have enough
weapons to destroy the
world several times over.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't need to expand this.

21:06.633 --> 21:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here's the real problem,
when the two big guys, the
people with 95 percent of the

21:13.267 --> 21:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world's arsenals, U.S. and
Russia together have 95 percent
of all the weapons in the

21:16.467 --> 21:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world, when we say we need
more, what is China to think?

21:19.967 --> 21:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have about 200.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do they start building more?

21:22.767 --> 21:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How about India and Pakistan?

21:24.767 --> 21:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's the big worry
that you have here is
this ill-considered
tweet could launch

21:29.500 --> 21:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a global arms race.

21:31.433 --> 21:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twitter is fine for criticizing
Alec Baldwin, but don't
use it to make U.S. policy.

21:36.767 --> 21:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, step away
from the Twitter.

21:37.733 --> 21:39.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
YANG: Go ahead.

21:39.067 --> 21:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KROENIG: Three thoughts on that.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, there's a 400 warhead
difference, I do disagree,
I do think that matters.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even if we don't think it
matters, the Russians pay close
attention to nuclear weapons.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They rely more on nuclear
weapons in their strategy.

21:50.933 --> 21:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I think they think this
difference matters and they
say, see, this U.S. failure

21:57.167 --> 21:59.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to respond to some of their
actions as sign of weakness.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in terms of this
idea that if we reduce
our arsenal, somehow
China and other countries

22:03.200 --> 22:07.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to come along,
that was the position
that really underline
the Obama administration

22:07.267 --> 22:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear strategy and
we've seen that it hasn't
worked, as the United
States reduced its arsenal,

22:11.867 --> 22:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other countries have gone
in the other directions.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I don't see this
as the United States
starting an arms race.

22:16.967 --> 22:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite the contrary, it's really
responding to what's going
on in these other countries.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think a failure
to respond is what would
be really dangerous.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it would incentivize
further nuclear aggression.

22:25.933 --> 22:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: And, Mr. Cirincione, even
if this is a continuation of
the Obama policy to modernize

22:32.400 --> 22:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the arsenal, you think that even
the Obama policy is a bad idea?

22:35.833 --> 22:37.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that what I take
from what you said?

22:37.467 --> 22:39.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CIRINCIONE: Absolutely.

22:39.467 --> 22:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The very first thing General
Mattis is going to find out
when he takes over as secretary

22:42.133 --> 22:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defense is we don't have
the money to pay for the
programs that are on the books.

22:45.967 --> 22:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, if the Navy
goes ahead and builds
a whole new fleet of
ballistic missile submarines

22:50.833 --> 22:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the next decade, it has
to cut its conventional
navy by 50 percent.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who would make that
kind of choice?

22:59.367 --> 23:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these are some of the
considerations that will
face the new administration.

23:02.700 --> 23:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here's the upside of this
-- let's say this is all about
negotiating leverage, this

23:09.733 --> 23:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Mr. Trump opening up closed
issues, looking for bargaining
in ahead of his meeting with

23:12.533 --> 23:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin, which
will probably occur in the
beginning of next year.

23:15.900 --> 23:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, here's where he could cash
in, he should take a page from
Ronald Reagan, and negotiate

23:20.200 --> 23:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Putin, deep cuts in both
sides' nuclear forces, get rid
of these unnecessary weapons

23:27.200 --> 23:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't need, save hundreds
of billions of dollars to use
for conventional forces, and

23:31.567 --> 23:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really make a name for himself.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This could be the
deal of a lifetime.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This would put him in the
history books and then we won't
be talking about these silly

23:38.433 --> 23:39.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: Matthew Kroenig,
what about that?

23:41.600 --> 23:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a dealmaker, he's
businessman and he talks about
trying to keep his negotiating

23:47.500 --> 23:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opponents off balance
and that sort of thing.

23:49.700 --> 23:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can we learn anything or take
anything from this about what
kind of foreign policy President

23:55.333 --> 23:56.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump will be?

23:56.300 --> 23:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KROENIG: Well, two points.

23:57.567 --> 23:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First to Joe, first
on the modernization.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe has thought a lot about
these issues, but he is
outside the mainstream.

24:02.967 --> 24:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a bipartisan consensus
that the United States needs
to modernize the arsenal.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was Obama
administration's policy.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has support from
Republicans and that should
go ahead under Trump.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Joe also raised
the issue of cost.

24:14.867 --> 24:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the cost of these
modernization programs,
you mentioned $1 trillion
over 30 years, but

24:18.933 --> 24:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that comes to about 5 percent
of the U.S. defense budget.

24:22.300 --> 24:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, current Secretary of Defense
Ash Carter has said this is
the bedrock of our security.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Secretary of Defense
Chuck Hagel has said it's the
most important mission of the

24:30.867 --> 24:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Department of Defense.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think anybody
thinks 5 percent is too much
for the most important mission

24:35.667 --> 24:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Department of Defense.

24:37.333 --> 24:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On your question, what
does this signal about
Trump's foreign policy?

24:41.133 --> 24:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's difficult to know
whether this means a change in
U.S. nuclear policy or not.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All we have to go on is a
tweet and a couple of tweets
and a couple of statements.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It may mean just continuing
Obama's policy of modernization.

24:51.467 --> 24:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I am hopeful that
it means strengthening
the arsenal because I
do think there are some

24:54.900 --> 24:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things the United
States can do within its
international obligations
to strengthen deterrence.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YANG: I'm sorry, I'm afraid
we have to leave there.

25:00.467 --> 25:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

in the battle against
the deadly Ebola virus.

One experimental vaccine
has been shown to be 100

HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: The results of
a two-year trial led by the

25:34.567 --> 25:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World Health Organization
were published in the
journal "Lancet" yesterday.

25:37.633 --> 25:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They showed that of nearly 6,000
people vaccinated in Guinea last
year, none had contracted Ebola

25:44.033 --> 25:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after a ten-day period.

25:45.733 --> 25:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
While in the group not
vaccinated, 23 cases developed.

25:49.567 --> 25:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vaccine still needs
regulatory approval,
but is considered so
effective that some 300,000

25:55.733 --> 25:57.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doses have already
been stockpiled.

25:57.567 --> 26:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West
Africa killed 11,000 people.

26:04.533 --> 26:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on this promising
news, we turn once again
to Dr. Anthony Fauci.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's director of the
National Institute for
Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, and has long

26:10.733 --> 26:12.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been involved in

26:12.767 --> 26:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Fauci, everyone's
pretty excited about the
100 percent efficacy rate.

26:17.233 --> 26:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's look under the hood a bit.

26:19.333 --> 26:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't the same type of
clinical trial that we're used
to in drug approval or vaccine

26:23.100 --> 26:24.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approval, is it?

26:24.100 --> 26:26.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:26.233 --> 26:28.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY
AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
No, it's a bit unusual.

26:28.267 --> 26:31.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vaccine trial is referred
to as a ring vaccine trial
which means that cases were

26:32.633 --> 26:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
identified in Guinea
that indeed had Ebola.

26:36.033 --> 26:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, instead of preemptively
ahead of time vaccinating whole
groups of populations, the

26:43.000 --> 26:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals were divided into
two separate groups, groups
that were vaccinated immediately

26:49.467 --> 26:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had contact with the index
case or cases or contact of
contacts, and another group

26:55.900 --> 26:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that was vaccinated
21 days later.

26:58.933 --> 27:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was more of an acute
response to an outbreak by
trying to protect those people

27:05.600 --> 27:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who were, in reality
or potentially exposed
to the index cases.

27:12.067 --> 27:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not the standard way
that you do a vaccine trial.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, although these results
are really quite encouraging,
there is still a lot more

27:20.800 --> 27:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work to be done on vaccines
for Ebola, and that's exactly
where we're heading with this,

27:27.800 --> 27:31.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to get many more people
in a larger trial and
to also determine, is
the effect durable?

27:33.233 --> 27:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, if I vaccinate
you now, will you be protected
six months, eight months

27:38.433 --> 27:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a year from now and
just how powerful that
protective response would be.

27:44.133 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really the kinds of
questions that still remain a
bit unanswered, despite the

27:48.033 --> 27:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that this finding now
from the Guinea trial is
really quite impressive.

27:52.767 --> 27:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: There was one
vaccine that was tested at the
center of this, but there are

27:56.400 --> 27:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
multiple strains of Ebola.

27:58.533 --> 28:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAUCI: That's another question
that needs to be answered
and it's a good point that

28:02.533 --> 28:04.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you bring up.

28:04.567 --> 28:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This vaccine that was
tested in Guinea against
the Zaire strain of Ebola.

28:11.733 --> 28:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are more than one strain,
particularly, a second train
called the Sudan strain, but

28:15.933 --> 28:18.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maybe two other strains.

28:18.467 --> 28:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we ultimately
get the vaccine that
what we would consider
to be the optimal season,

28:25.533 --> 28:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we would want one that, A, has
a great durability of effect,
that would be effective over a

28:30.533 --> 28:33.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
considerable period of time,
and, B, something that would
be able to protect essentially

28:35.733 --> 28:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against all strains of Ebola,
because there are different
strains that pop up in different

28:41.600 --> 28:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts of sub-Saharan Africa,
and we have clear-cut
experience with that.

28:44.567 --> 28:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, given the
test that's just been done with
this specific vaccine, this

28:48.033 --> 28:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not like a polio vaccine
where you get it once in your
life and you're vaccinated.

28:51.967 --> 28:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're still going to need a
lot more tests to figure out
that combination of different

28:57.833 --> 28:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
viruses and how long they last.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FAUCI: Absolutely.

29:00.667 --> 29:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those are critical
questions that you ask.

29:03.500 --> 29:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This -- some people when they
hear about how really impressive
the results are, they think,

29:08.400 --> 29:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, we're done now with the
Ebola vaccine, we're going to
move on because we've solved

29:12.933 --> 29:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the problem.

29:15.033 --> 29:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We haven't come anywhere
near solving the problem
because there are still
so many unanswered

29:18.300 --> 29:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions that we need to pursue
before we get a vaccine that
we feel would be universally

29:25.733 --> 29:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
able to be widespread
administered to people
to protect them from
outbreaks of Ebola of

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
multiple different strains.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.867 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
There's a lot of
work to be done.

29:33.867 --> 29:35.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

29:35.867 --> 29:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While we have you, I also
wanted to just ask you about the
avian flu that's in Asia right

29:38.900 --> 29:40.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

29:40.967 --> 29:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're reporting about the
millions of birds in Korea and
other parts of Asia that have

29:43.000 --> 29:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been culled already.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How concerned should
we about this?

29:46.933 --> 29:49.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FAUCI: We need to pay
attention to this.

29:49.067 --> 29:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there's any real
need to panic at all about it,
because we have been following

29:53.133 --> 29:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
outbreaks of bird
flu for decades.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first time we got involved
with it here was back in the
'90s in Hong Kong when you

30:03.533 --> 30:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had the H5N1 which are viruses
that are influenza viruses that
are fundamentally viruses of

30:11.067 --> 30:16.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fowl, water fowl, or
chickens, sometimes
pigs and other animals.

30:18.067 --> 30:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They rarely jump into species
and infect humans, and when they
do infect humans, they do not

30:23.067 --> 30:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
efficiently spread
from human-to-human.

30:25.733 --> 30:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where most of the bird
flu situation is right now.

30:29.833 --> 30:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But having said that, we
always have to be alert for the
threat or the possibility that

30:36.800 --> 30:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they may, when they jump species
like from a chicken or another
type of a fowl to a human,

30:41.933 --> 30:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they then become really
efficient in spreading
from person to person.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We've not seen that thus far.

30:47.700 --> 30:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hopefully, we'll never see it,
but we've even begun trying to
develop vaccines against some

30:54.067 --> 30:56.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these avian type flu.

30:56.367 --> 30:59.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, no need to panic but
don't just blow it off.

30:59.667 --> 31:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We've got to keep
our eye out on it.

31:01.433 --> 31:02.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

31:02.667 --> 31:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Anthony Fauci,
thanks so much.

31:06.033 --> 31:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAUCI: Good to be with you.

JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: Stay with us.

31:15.700 --> 31:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on this week's news,

31:20.467 --> 31:25.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and our troops send
their holiday cheer.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first, thousands of Haitians
are waiting to get into the
U.S., and thousands more are

31:32.633 --> 31:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on their way through
Latin America.

31:34.600 --> 31:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew -- which
killed hundreds of Haitians and
destroyed thousands of homes

31:38.767 --> 31:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - has upped the stakes for
their migrating relatives.

31:42.033 --> 31:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jean Guerrero, our partners at
location station KPBS Fronteras
reporter, has the story.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

31:48.833 --> 31:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO, KPBS FRONTERAS
REPORTER: The surge of
Haitians started in May.

31:52.267 --> 31:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. customs officials couldn't
process them fast enough, and
a backlog formed in Tijuana.

31:59.233 --> 32:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, shelters like Desayunador
Salesiano have had to improvise
spaces for the migrants,

32:03.967 --> 32:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as they wait for their
turn to cross into the U.S.

32:06.500 --> 32:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The destruction wrought
by hurricane Matthew
about two months ago
has left these Haitian

32:12.600 --> 32:14.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
migrants more
desperate than ever.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARDO MARTINEZ, DESAYUNADOR
SALESIANO COORDINATOR
(through translator):
They have family members

32:16.933 --> 32:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who've suffered, and their
concern is to help them from
here, or from the United States.

32:23.433 --> 32:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: One of those Haitians
is Frederic Saint Cois, whose
family in Haiti survived

32:29.233 --> 32:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the devastating floods.

32:31.300 --> 32:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he wants to send them
money so they can get by in
the newly ravaged country.

32:36.633 --> 32:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He hopes to find
a job in the U.S.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through
translator): We came
here looking for life.

32:41.233 --> 32:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: He said he spent a lot
of money to make it this far,
as did his fellow travelers.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The journey involved long
walking stretches, bus travel
and more through some of Latin

32:51.367 --> 32:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
America's most
dangerous countries.

32:53.333 --> 32:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through
translator): I saw
many, many people die.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GUERRERO: That's why
sudden shifts in U.S.
immigration policy have
left him so bewildered.

33:00.367 --> 33:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since the 2010 earthquake, the
U.S. has been letting Haitians
in under a humanitarian parole

33:06.267 --> 33:08.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
provision.

33:08.367 --> 33:12.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a few weeks ago, responding
to the overwhelming influx of
migrants, the U.S. revokes that

33:13.133 --> 33:15.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
privilege.

33:15.133 --> 33:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The decision to resume
deportations was motivated by
improved conditions in Haiti.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Hurricane Matthew struck
a few days later, plunging
the country back into crisis.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, officials continued
detaining and deporting
new Haitian arrivals.

33:28.833 --> 33:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But recent overcrowding
in detention centers have
led officials to allow
some Haitian migrants

33:34.567 --> 33:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to enter the U.S.

33:36.733 --> 33:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among the Haitians who managed
to cross into the U.S. before
the policy changes is Sandra

33:41.367 --> 33:45.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alexandre, whose baby
was born hours after
she crossed the border.

33:45.667 --> 33:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The baby's father, Volcy
(ph), missed the birth and
still hasn't met his daughter.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was supposed to cross a
few days after Sandra, right
when the policy shifted.

33:55.633 --> 33:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When he crossed, he was
placed in an immigration
detention center.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He still hasn't been released.

34:01.533 --> 34:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA ALEXANDRE, HAITIAN
MIGRANT (through translator):
It's very difficult for me and

34:04.500 --> 34:06.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the baby.

34:06.767 --> 34:11.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know when he's
going to come here.

34:13.967 --> 34:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: Alexandre says she
wishes she'd known the policy
was going to change before

34:18.433 --> 34:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making the dangerous trek
through Latin America
with her fiance, while
she was nine months

34:22.933 --> 34:24.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pregnant.

34:24.033 --> 34:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many times she almost gave up.

34:26.100 --> 34:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDRE: I was like, "it's
too difficult, I won't make
it," but Volcy said, "Yes, you

34:32.667 --> 34:34.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can make it.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Little by little, but
you're going to make it.

34:36.567 --> 34:38.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Be brave."

34:38.267 --> 34:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GUERRERO: She says she
can't go back to Haiti.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDRE: In Haiti,
life is very difficult.

34:44.733 --> 34:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Very, very, very difficult.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's also very dangerous.

34:49.933 --> 34:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUERRERO: In the meantime,
Tijuana residents are
responding to Haitians
with unusual hospitality.

34:56.167 --> 35:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All day, they stop by the
migrant shelters where Haitians
congregate, giving away clothes,

35:03.067 --> 35:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropping off snacks like
sandwiches and sports drinks,
even preparing full meals.

35:08.067 --> 35:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANETH AGUILAR, TIJUANA
RESIDENT (through translator):
We come every day with them.

35:12.167 --> 35:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We bring them candy, food.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're with them a little while.

35:15.633 --> 35:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yesterday, they braided
my whole head of hair.

35:18.800 --> 35:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: She remembers when
she first saw the large crowds
of Haitians on the streets.

35:23.667 --> 35:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was an unusual sight
-- only about 1 percent of
Mexico's population is black.

35:30.067 --> 35:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aguilar went online to find
out what was happening.

35:33.100 --> 35:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She learned that the migrants
were coming from countries
with political and economic

35:37.033 --> 35:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crises, and she wanted to help.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AGUILAR: We come to give
them a happy moment.

35:41.967 --> 35:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since they lack everything,
we want to make sure
they don't lack a smile.

35:48.900 --> 35:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: The streets of Tijuana
have long been filled with
migrants heading to the U.S.,

35:52.833 --> 35:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as the deported
-- mostly from southern
Mexico and Central America.

35:57.733 --> 36:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those migrants are often
shunned by the locals, forced to
live out of sight, in sewers.

36:02.300 --> 36:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Tijuana residents recently
set up a table on the street,
offering fried chicken, rice

36:08.767 --> 36:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and beans to the Haitians, a
Mexican migrant got in line.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jorge Cruz, a Tijuana taxi
driver who brought the chicken,
was not happy about that.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORGE CRUZ, TIJUANA DRIVER
(through translator): I
told him, "You're Mexican,
what do you lack?"

36:20.467 --> 36:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: Despite the warm
welcome in Mexico, the Haitians
are intent on making it into

36:25.300 --> 36:27.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through
translator): I have
faith in Christ, in God.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
God is always helping me.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUERRERO: He knows he might
be placed in a detention
center and deported.

36:35.267 --> 36:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not going to stop
him from trying, and hoping.

36:39.200 --> 36:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour", I'm Jean
Guerrero in Tijuana, Mexico.

36:46.733 --> 36:51.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

36:51.500 --> 36:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

36:56.133 --> 37:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and "New York
Times" columnist David Brooks.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

37:02.900 --> 37:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So let's start out talking
about two major foreign policy
waves, I guess you could say,

37:08.767 --> 37:10.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Donald Trump is
making today, David.

37:10.867 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He directly intervened with
the White House as they were
deciding how to handle this U.N.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resolution on Israel.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is now an open rift
with President Obama.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is different, isn't
it, from the way we see a
transition normally work?

37:23.867 --> 37:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS, NEW YORK
TIMES COLUMNIST: Certainly,
the country can't have
two presidents at once,

37:27.767 --> 37:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the tradition has been
to hang back if you're
the president-elect
and wait for your

37:30.933 --> 37:33.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time in office.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is not a
hang-back kind of guy.

37:35.600 --> 37:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has shifted --- President
Obama has shifted American
policy in a much more critical

37:42.200 --> 37:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way in Israel with the
settlements than the
previous presidents.

37:45.033 --> 37:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But we're about to
get a head-snapping
shift the other way.

37:48.300 --> 37:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump's
ambassador to Israel is further
to the right than almost anyone

37:52.800 --> 37:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Israel, further to the right
than Bibi Netanyahu on the
settlements, and almost opposes

37:58.867 --> 38:00.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the two-state
solution, doesn't he?

38:00.967 --> 38:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we are about to see a
tremendous shift in American
policy toward the Middle East.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: How do
you see this, Mark?

38:07.567 --> 38:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are there consequences of
this or is this going to be
something we look back on and

38:10.233 --> 38:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say, well, that's what happened?

38:12.233 --> 38:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS, SYNDICATED
COLUMNIST: No, I mean, I think
Donald Trump is sui generis.

38:14.133 --> 38:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, he is acting by
president or tradition.

38:18.133 --> 38:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's acting as Donald Trump
has throughout his entire
public career of, what, a year

38:25.533 --> 38:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a half, and that is to be
impulsive, be spontaneous, keep
his opponents or adversaries

38:32.033 --> 38:34.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off balance.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's his approach.

38:35.567 --> 38:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is not into nuance,
that is not his strength.

38:40.233 --> 38:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president said this
week, he's entitled to his own
policies and but just hope that

38:46.567 --> 38:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's deliberate and thoughtful.

38:48.933 --> 38:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this strikes
me as anything but.

38:51.100 --> 38:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, in addition to
Israel, what we were sitting
here talking about nuclear

38:55.367 --> 39:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy because Donald Trump
tweeted, as far as we can tell,
out of the blue yesterday,

39:00.200 --> 39:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
David, that the United
States needs to beef
up its nuclear arsenal.

39:03.833 --> 39:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did an interview with Mika
Brzezinski of NBC this morning
and I'm just reading the

39:10.133 --> 39:12.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quote here.

39:12.200 --> 39:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "Let it be an arms
race, we will outmatch them
at every pass and outlast them

39:18.933 --> 39:19.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all."

39:19.933 --> 39:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what does this say?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROOKS: Yes, one of the things
I think about with Donald Trump
is what are his words actually

39:24.633 --> 39:26.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attached to?

39:26.633 --> 39:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With a normal president like
President Obama, he says a word,
and that's because there has

39:30.100 --> 39:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been some thought that he's
done and there had been
policy papers and there's been

39:33.367 --> 39:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aides and there's been
advisors and then there is a
connection to an actual set of

39:37.233 --> 39:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policies.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, the words like have
roots into actual stuff.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With Trump, I'm not sure
the words have roots.

39:44.233 --> 39:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are emanations
of his psyche, but has
he thought it through?

39:48.333 --> 39:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there an argument, is
there a policy implication?

39:50.133 --> 39:53.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Even in this nuclear
thing, he says we should
be stronger and expand.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

39:55.033 --> 39:57.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what is concrete
in what he's saying?

39:57.067 --> 40:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think as we interpret him
and frankly as the world learns
to interpret Donald Trump,

40:01.467 --> 40:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are these just words that are
enigmatic things floating on
air or are they actually shifts

40:06.133 --> 40:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in policy and will they
change moment by moment,
day by day without any
underlying connection

40:12.233 --> 40:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the actual stuff
of governance?

40:13.133 --> 40:14.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Mark, we're talking
about nuclear arms policy.

40:17.200 --> 40:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something that in the
past, it was something that
people spent time thinking

40:21.867 --> 40:23.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about before
statements were made.

40:23.967 --> 40:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you said a minute
ago, you think he's keeping
everybody off balance.

40:28.233 --> 40:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this a deliberate strategy?

40:29.433 --> 40:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: Well, I think
that's part of it.

40:31.300 --> 40:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The points David make
I think really deserve
reflection and consideration.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Donald Trump,
we have to understand,
has not had experiences
like any other president

40:41.933 --> 40:43.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we've ever had.

40:43.467 --> 40:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's never been accountable
to anybody, save Donald Trump.

40:46.567 --> 40:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, he has no investors.

40:49.033 --> 40:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has -- he has debtors,
but he doesn't have
a board of directors.

40:55.467 --> 40:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't have a corporate
structure he's had to answer to.

40:59.433 --> 41:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he's been able to kind
of wing it at every stage.

41:02.867 --> 41:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I just don't think he
understands -- the point
David was making is
when a president makes

41:07.700 --> 41:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement, Judy, it is studied
around the world, the nuance
and was there an emphasis

41:15.167 --> 41:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, and what was
in the last statement
that's missing -- perhaps
overly done, maybe overly

41:18.400 --> 41:20.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
analyzed.

41:20.900 --> 41:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because the president's
words are pretentious,
they really carry with
them enormous significance

41:26.833 --> 41:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and are usually reflective
of great consideration
and even arguments
within that one side is

41:32.967 --> 41:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted, one particular paragraph
or sentence, while the other
said, no, that shouldn't be

41:36.700 --> 41:38.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in there.

41:38.600 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I just think that Trump
-- he has not made the
transition, it seems to me, from

41:44.233 --> 41:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate to even
president in waiting.

41:47.933 --> 41:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has been a sore winner.

41:49.933 --> 41:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He continues to in his rallies
to berate Hillary Clinton.

41:56.867 --> 42:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That sense of gracious,
generosity or larger vision
has eluded him so far.

42:03.233 --> 42:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But, David, some --
not but -- and some people,
David, have looked at what he's

42:06.233 --> 42:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing and they said, this is
really part of a strategy.

42:09.133 --> 42:12.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Keep people off balance,
keep them guessing about
what you're going to do.

42:12.667 --> 42:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BROOKS: I think that's
a rationalization for
just the way he is.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it does have the effect
of keeping people off balance.

42:17.433 --> 42:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure that's
necessarily a good thing.

42:19.733 --> 42:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to bring us back to the
nuclear thing, keeping people
off balance with nuclear weapons

42:24.167 --> 42:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is not a good thing at all.

42:25.733 --> 42:28.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: No.

42:28.300 --> 42:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: And -- so I
would say, given, as Mark
describes, sort of -- he's
not part of a process.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I think there
are two things that could
happen as a result of this.

42:34.767 --> 42:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, it's possible to
imagine him having relatively
little influence on his
own government because

42:38.867 --> 42:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will be off in his own
world and the agencies
and the permanent
bureaucracy will just go

42:44.600 --> 42:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on and do its merry way.

42:46.533 --> 42:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of passive
aggressive behavior
in all governments.

42:47.767 --> 42:49.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's very hard to
get things done.

42:49.867 --> 42:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the same time, because
he's not tied down, there
could be a lot of erraticness

42:55.833 --> 42:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he could get caught up, just
the macho thing, especially,
let's say Vladimir Putin,

42:58.433 --> 43:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or somebody like that, and then
more and more erratic with,
you know, potentially, some

43:04.600 --> 43:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of nuclear
weapons attached.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: It was even suggested
to me, apropos the point David
was making, that Republicans

43:12.500 --> 43:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Democrats have been
adversaries for a long
time on foreign policy.

43:16.333 --> 43:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, I mean, it could be a
common interest at some point in
sort of uniting in solidarity.

43:23.200 --> 43:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we've had every
president, Judy - - I mean,
John Kennedy began in 1963 with

43:30.067 --> 43:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nuclear test ban treaty
banning, you know - -
agreeing with the Soviets
to ban all testing

43:35.800 --> 43:38.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the atmosphere or
space or underwater.

43:38.267 --> 43:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that has been the
guide of every president.

43:41.133 --> 43:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Ronald Reagan who came
in as the leader of the toughest
Soviet bloc, the evil empire

43:48.100 --> 43:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - I mean, ended up as really
a possible arms reduction
advocate, a champion of it.

43:57.367 --> 44:02.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When Mikhail Gorbachev
-- you know, I mean,
it's been the policy of
both parties, presidents

44:05.167 --> 44:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of both parties, and just to
see something like this cast
aside as an aside, as his own

44:12.800 --> 44:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are going on the
air last night explaining
what he actually meant
was to stabilize or

44:19.033 --> 44:21.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
modernize.

44:21.033 --> 44:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, he goes on with Mika
Brzezinski this morning before
the show and says, no, no,

44:26.100 --> 44:27.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what he said
originally he meant.

44:27.767 --> 44:28.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean --

44:28.767 --> 44:29.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: An arms race.

44:29.767 --> 44:31.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: Yes.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: And we'll
outlast them all.

44:33.100 --> 44:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So even he's got -- he seems
to have a lot of support among
Republicans and even Democrats

44:35.567 --> 44:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for his position on
Israel, nuclear -- nuclear
is something different.

44:39.933 --> 44:42.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: Yes.

44:42.067 --> 44:45.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: I want to
ask you about incoming
Trump administration
potential conflicts of

44:45.467 --> 44:47.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Story in the "Wall Street
Journal" this week, David, about
Tom Price, the congressman from

44:50.900 --> 44:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia having done
stock trading in the
last few years and health
medical companies, he's

44:58.367 --> 45:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be overseeing
these policies -- he
was voting observe these
policies as a congressman,

45:01.833 --> 45:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will be overseeing
that at the Department of
Health and Human Services.

45:06.633 --> 45:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carl Icahn named as an
informal to the president
on business regulation.

45:13.033 --> 45:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's somebody who's got
enormous business interest.

45:15.067 --> 45:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's the story
about Eric Trump, his son and
the charitable organization.

45:21.433 --> 45:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we -- how do we even get
our arms around all this?

45:23.133 --> 45:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, to me, it's
mostly about public trust.

45:26.133 --> 45:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do -- can you trust people to
do their public service roles
in a pretty much straight-up,

45:32.300 --> 45:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honorable way on the
merits of the issues?

45:34.400 --> 45:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I happen to think most
people go into government do
it for the right reasons and

45:37.233 --> 45:41.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they really do things
as they see them on the
merits of the issues.

45:41.167 --> 45:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it doesn't help if there's
the appearance and it doesn't
help if the standards by which

45:47.533 --> 45:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we separate public and
private life begin to erode.

45:50.533 --> 45:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that generally was the
course -- you leave private life
behind when you go into public

45:56.700 --> 45:58.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life, because you're
not just a person.

45:58.167 --> 46:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're inhabiting a role that
the Constitution gave you.

46:00.633 --> 46:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not sure Trump has had
that distinction between private
and public life in his head.

46:07.567 --> 46:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I think there's likely
to be an erosion of just
that standard, that different

46:09.667 --> 46:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standard, consciousness, and
I think it's likely we'll
see what we haven't seen in

46:11.933 --> 46:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last eight years and even
the last 12 or 16 of private
enrichment in office and

46:18.900 --> 46:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scandals where people have to
resign and things like that,
because just once the standards

46:21.800 --> 46:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go, behavior tends to go.

46:23.833 --> 46:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But, Mark, are his
supporters prepared to accept
a different standard for Donald

46:29.100 --> 46:31.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

46:31.133 --> 46:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, no, I think
part of Donald Trump's appeal
is that he's a guy that does

46:33.100 --> 46:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut corners, that he's the
guy that does get deals and
maybe does break a speed limit.

46:37.567 --> 46:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there was sort of a
roguish, rascally, but I get
things done even if I break the

46:43.833 --> 46:46.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

46:46.367 --> 46:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think, you know,
the words of Jefferson
echo even today, when
a man assumes a public

46:51.833 --> 46:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust, he must assume he is
public property, and that's
exactly what's the case here.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Tom Price, I don't
know he had time to make votes
on the floor, he had such an

46:59.867 --> 47:04.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
active stock portfolio
and in areas that he
was legislating on.

47:06.033 --> 47:08.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, so that will be
a subject of hearings.

47:08.067 --> 47:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Donald Trump's statement
that Carl Icahn, because he's
not taking a salary doesn't have

47:11.867 --> 47:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a conflict of
interest -- I'm sorry.

47:14.333 --> 47:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, Carl Icahn has
major oil interests.

47:17.433 --> 47:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He urged and recommended
the appointment of
the EPA administrator,
and, you know, he was

47:25.767 --> 47:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
championed for him.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Of course, there are
conflicts of interest.

47:29.067 --> 47:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't come
down to a salary.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It comes down to
your own enrichment.

47:33.833 --> 47:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And is there a difference?

47:36.267 --> 47:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there concept in Donald
Trump's mind of public policy
that there is a public interest

47:42.733 --> 47:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is separate and distinct
from personal interest?

47:45.867 --> 47:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if there are people
around him, who -- certainly
they haven't been throughout

47:49.933 --> 47:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his career, who are
saying this is in the
greater public interest.

47:53.633 --> 47:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just doesn't seem to be
part whether in his personal
behavior, personal comportment,

48:00.700 --> 48:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
doesn't seem to be a
strong commitment or
value of public service.

48:04.333 --> 48:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: We seem to keep coming
back, David, to this question
of what he was used to in

48:07.900 --> 48:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the private sector and what now
he faces in the public sector.

48:11.733 --> 48:13.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROOKS: Right.

48:13.300 --> 48:14.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's one thing.

48:14.800 --> 48:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some people are very different
in different circumstances.

48:17.100 --> 48:18.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's not.

48:18.100 --> 48:19.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's one thing.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he's been one thing.

48:21.067 --> 48:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, we were
talking about he's got to
moderate his campaigns.

48:22.333 --> 48:25.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's worked for him,
at least by his lights.

48:25.767 --> 48:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I imagine he's going to be
this way all straight through.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't imagine a 70-year-old
guy is going to change.

48:32.567 --> 48:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, he's going to be this
way and we're going to have
to cover it and the world is

48:35.133 --> 48:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to have to -- I keep
coming back to the world
literally -- how much of this is

48:38.333 --> 48:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual literal and how much
is a marketing guy who treats
words as tools for money?

48:45.600 --> 48:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, we're going to have
to adjust and not react a lot
of the time and think that

48:52.467 --> 48:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something's substantively
actually happening.

48:53.467 --> 48:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: All right.

48:55.500 --> 48:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, we wish you a merry
Christmas, happy New York
