00:17.517 --> 00:18.986
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA FOR

00:18.986 --> 00:20.420
ITS ACTIONS IN UKRAINE.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.589
WE’LL HAVE A REPORT FROM KIEV.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.124
AND THE ISLAMIC STATE, USING

00:24.124 --> 00:26.059
SOCIAL MEDIA TO WIN RECRUITS BY

00:26.059 --> 00:27.794
PROMOTING ITS SAVAGERY.

00:27.794 --> 00:31.265
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.367
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:34.968 --> 00:37.004
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:37.004 --> 00:37.771
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:37.771 --> 00:38.672
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.407
WITH THOUSANDS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS

00:40.407 --> 00:41.441
NOW REPORTEDLY FIGHTING

00:41.441 --> 00:42.776
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES IN

00:42.776 --> 00:44.611
EASTERN UKRAINE, UKRAINIAN

00:44.611 --> 00:46.046
PRESIDENT PETRO POROSHENKO

00:46.046 --> 00:47.648
APPEALED TODAY FOR HELP FROM THE

00:47.648 --> 00:48.415
WEST.

00:48.415 --> 00:49.216
AND DURING A MEETING WITH

00:49.216 --> 00:50.317
EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS IN

00:50.317 --> 00:51.752
BRUSSELS, HE WARNED THAT THE

00:51.752 --> 00:53.787
CRISIS PUTS AT "HIGH RISK" NOT

00:53.787 --> 00:55.088
ONLY PEACE AND STABILITY IN

00:55.088 --> 00:58.025
UKRAINE BUT THROUGHOUT EUROPE.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.026
>> I THINK THAT WE ARE VERY

00:59.026 --> 01:01.762
CLOSE TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.864
POINT OF NO RETURN IS FULL-SCALE

01:03.864 --> 01:07.801
WAR, WHICH ALREADY HAPPENED IN

01:07.801 --> 01:09.970
THE TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY

01:09.970 --> 01:11.271
SEPARATISTS.

01:11.271 --> 01:11.772
>> Sreenivasan: THE WESTERN

01:11.772 --> 01:12.873
LEADERS ARE DEBATING WHETHER TO

01:12.873 --> 01:14.508
IMPOSE A THIRD ROUND OF MORE

01:14.508 --> 01:15.943
STRINGENT SANCTIONS AGAINST

01:15.943 --> 01:17.911
RUSSIA FOLLOWING ITS TAKEOVER OF

01:17.911 --> 01:19.646
CRIMEA AND ITS MORE RECENT

01:19.646 --> 01:20.580
INTERVENTION.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.581
FOR MORE ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN

01:21.581 --> 01:22.883
UKRAINE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

01:22.883 --> 01:23.984
ALAN CULLISON OF THE "WALL

01:23.984 --> 01:24.685
STREET JOURNAL."

01:24.685 --> 01:26.920
HE JOINS ME VIA SKYPE FROM KIEV.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.788
ALAN, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.289
WHAT’S THE LATEST THERE THIS

01:29.289 --> 01:30.123
MORNING?

01:30.123 --> 01:31.458
THE WHOLE WEEK WE’VE BEEN

01:31.458 --> 01:33.260
REPORTING ON NEW INCURSIONS OR

01:33.260 --> 01:34.294
INVASIONS-- HOWEVER YOU WANT TO

01:34.294 --> 01:35.562
CALL THEM-- BY RUSSIAN TROOPS

01:35.562 --> 01:38.865
INTO DIFFERENT PART OF UKRAINE.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.034
>> THERE ARE MORE DETAILS OF

01:41.034 --> 01:43.937
MORE ARMOR BEING POURED IN.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.907
THE LATEST ALLEGATION IS THAT AN

01:46.907 --> 01:49.476
ARMORED COLUMN THAT CAME IN FROM

01:49.476 --> 01:52.112
RUSSIA FLATTENED A TOWN NEAR

01:52.112 --> 01:54.848
THE BORDER, A UKRAINIAN TOWN.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.217
IT’S NOTHING THAT ANY OF US CAN

01:57.217 --> 01:59.619
CONFIRM SINCE GETTING INTO THAT

01:59.619 --> 02:01.855
PART OF THE BATTLE ZONE IS

02:01.855 --> 02:03.190
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.791
BUT BASICALLY, IT’S JUST A

02:04.791 --> 02:08.562
GRADUAL ESCALATION AND

02:08.562 --> 02:11.598
OVERWHELMING... THEY SAY THAT

02:11.598 --> 02:12.899
THE UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE JUST

02:12.899 --> 02:15.736
FACING OVERWHELMING ODDS AND SO

02:15.736 --> 02:18.372
ARE BEING ENCIRCLED OR PUSHED

02:18.372 --> 02:19.906
BACK.

02:19.906 --> 02:20.474
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE

02:20.474 --> 02:21.441
SPECIFIC VILLAGES?

02:21.441 --> 02:22.542
ARE THERE SPECIFIC AREAS RIGHT

02:22.542 --> 02:23.744
ALONG THE BORDER WHO ARE FEELING

02:23.744 --> 02:25.212
IT MORE, WHO BASICALLY HAVE NO

02:25.212 --> 02:27.347
CHOICE NOW?

02:27.347 --> 02:28.315
>> WELL, THERE WERE... YES,

02:28.315 --> 02:29.249
THERE WERE TWO... BASICALLY,

02:29.249 --> 02:31.418
THERE ARE TWO BATTLE FRONTS NEAR

02:31.418 --> 02:33.620
THE UKRAINIAN BORDER.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.056
ONE WAS... ONE WAS NEAR THE

02:36.056 --> 02:38.058
UKRAINIAN CITY OF LUHANSK.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.394
THE OTHER WAS ONE NEAR DONETSK.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.029
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK WAS

02:42.029 --> 02:45.932
THAT AN ARMORED COLUMN BROKE

02:45.932 --> 02:48.635
INTO UKRAINE IN AN AREA WHERE

02:48.635 --> 02:50.337
THERE WASN’T ANY REBEL ACTIVITY

02:50.337 --> 02:52.005
BEFORE, WHICH WAS CLEARLY

02:52.005 --> 02:52.939
EVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE

02:52.939 --> 02:55.008
RUSSIAN FORCES DOING THIS.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.077
THAT’S THE... THAT’S BEEN THE

02:57.077 --> 02:59.546
MOST CATASTROPHIC PART OF THE

02:59.546 --> 03:02.049
WEEK FOR THE UKRAINIANS.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.650
THIS NEW FRONT THAT OPENED UP IN

03:03.650 --> 03:05.652
THE SOUTH ALONG THE SEA OF AZOV,

03:05.652 --> 03:07.788
BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN FORCES ARE

03:07.788 --> 03:10.257
MOVING ALONG THE COAST AND MAY

03:10.257 --> 03:12.526
BE TAKING THE TOWN OF... THE

03:12.526 --> 03:14.961
PORT CITY OF MARIUPOL.

03:14.961 --> 03:15.829
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE CASES

03:15.829 --> 03:17.464
WHERE THE UKRAINIANS ARE

03:17.464 --> 03:19.166
RETREATING, EITHER TACTICALLY OR

03:19.166 --> 03:20.767
OTHERWISE?

03:20.767 --> 03:21.868
>> YEAH, THEY’VE BEEN IN RETREAT

03:21.868 --> 03:24.404
FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.673
BUT MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE

03:26.673 --> 03:29.176
UKRAINIANS IS THAT SEVERAL OF

03:29.176 --> 03:31.078
THEIR GROUPS HAVE BEEN

03:31.078 --> 03:33.180
SURROUNDED AND, OF COURSE,

03:33.180 --> 03:35.348
GETTING OUT ALIVE, THAT IS A

03:35.348 --> 03:36.583
CONSIDERATION.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.385
THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO

03:38.385 --> 03:41.621
NEGOTIATE A DEAL, I BELIEVE, A

03:41.621 --> 03:44.691
TRADE FOR PRISONERS, AND IF THE

03:44.691 --> 03:46.059
UKRAINIANS WOULD GIVE UP SOME

03:46.059 --> 03:47.861
PRISONERS, THEN THE RUSSIANS

03:47.861 --> 03:49.496
MIGHT LET THEM OUT OF

03:49.496 --> 03:50.831
ENCIRCLEMENT AND BACK INTO

03:50.831 --> 03:52.232
THEIR OWN TERRITORY.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.967
BUT, YEAH, THE UKRAINIANS ARE

03:53.967 --> 03:56.036
TAKING A BEATING AT THIS POINT.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.170
>> Sreenivasan: HOW EFFECTIVE

03:57.170 --> 03:58.405
ARE... SOME OF THE VIDEOS THAT

03:58.405 --> 04:00.841
WE’VE SEEN OUT OF THERE OF...

04:00.841 --> 04:01.775
ESPECIALLY ON SORT OF UKRAINIAN

04:01.775 --> 04:03.310
INDEPENDENCE DAY IN THE LAST

04:03.310 --> 04:05.445
WEEK AND A HALF OR SO, WE SAW

04:05.445 --> 04:08.215
THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY THE

04:08.215 --> 04:10.083
SEPARATIST FORCES WERE PARADING

04:10.083 --> 04:11.318
UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS THROUGH THE

04:11.318 --> 04:11.885
STREETS.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.620
IS THAT KIND OF A MESSAGE

04:13.620 --> 04:14.688
GETTING OUT TO THE WIDER

04:14.688 --> 04:16.189
UKRAINE, THAT THIS IS AN ACTIVE

04:16.189 --> 04:17.557
WAR, THAT THERE ARE PRISONERS OF

04:17.557 --> 04:19.359
WAR?

04:19.359 --> 04:21.194
>> WELL, I THINK, AT LEAST IN

04:21.194 --> 04:23.063
UKRAINE, IT’S BEEN CLEAR THAT

04:23.063 --> 04:24.331
THEY’VE BEEN AT WAR FOR QUITE A

04:24.331 --> 04:26.299
WHILE.

04:26.299 --> 04:29.436
THEY’VE BEEN TRYING TO SEND THAT

04:29.436 --> 04:30.804
MESSAGE TO PEOPLE.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.773
I THINK THAT THE EFFECT OF THE

04:33.773 --> 04:36.576
PRISONER PARADE ON UKRAINE WAS

04:36.576 --> 04:38.311
THAT IT POLARIZED PEOPLE EVEN

04:38.311 --> 04:39.079
MORE.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.514
I MEAN, SOME WANT TO FIGHT

04:40.514 --> 04:41.248
HARDER.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.283
OTHERS ARE ALSO... IT’S JUST

04:43.283 --> 04:46.019
AROUSING ENORMOUS ANIMOSITY

04:46.019 --> 04:47.220
TOWARDS THOSE IN THE EAST WHO

04:47.220 --> 04:49.956
ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THEM, AND

04:49.956 --> 04:52.192
IT’S GOING TO MAKE PEACEMAKING A

04:52.192 --> 04:54.394
LOT MORE DIFFICULT.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.295
ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE THOSE

04:55.295 --> 04:57.964
UKRAINIANS WHO, IF THE FATIGUE

04:57.964 --> 05:01.001
SETS IN, AND IF THEY ARE... IF

05:01.001 --> 05:02.169
THIS WAR CONTINUES FOR A LONG

05:02.169 --> 05:05.972
TIME, THEY MIGHT DEVELOP A

05:05.972 --> 05:07.607
ATTITUDE THAT THEY’RE JUST A

05:07.607 --> 05:08.875
DIFFERENT PEOPLE OVER THERE WHO

05:08.875 --> 05:10.911
ARE SO HOSTILE, THAT THEY JUST

05:10.911 --> 05:12.312
DON’T WANT THEM TO BE PART OF

05:12.312 --> 05:13.380
UKRAINE.

05:13.380 --> 05:13.780
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

05:13.780 --> 05:15.348
IDEA THAT UKRAINE IS ESSENTIALLY

05:15.348 --> 05:17.717
CALLED OUT A DRAFT AND WANTS MEN

05:17.717 --> 05:19.920
TO ENTER INTO MILITARY SERVICE?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.022
>> WELL, I THINK MOBILIZATION IS

05:22.022 --> 05:25.392
WHAT MOST PEOPLE EXPECT.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.693
THEY’VE ACTUALLY... QUITE A FEW

05:26.693 --> 05:27.928
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING WHY IT

05:27.928 --> 05:30.163
HASN’T HAPPENED YET.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.165
IT’S SOMETHING THAT THE

05:32.165 --> 05:35.001
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN... I DON’T

05:35.001 --> 05:35.936
KNOW EXACTLY.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.737
IT’S HARD TO SAY WHY THEY’VE

05:37.737 --> 05:38.605
HELD OFF ON IT.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.407
I THINK THAT THEY WERE HOPING

05:40.407 --> 05:41.441
THAT THERE WOULD BE A

05:41.441 --> 05:42.742
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, AND THEY

05:42.742 --> 05:44.411
WERE ACTUALLY QUITE OPTIMISTIC

05:44.411 --> 05:46.413
ABOUT DEFEATING THE REBELS UP

05:46.413 --> 05:49.482
UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK, WEEK AND A

05:49.482 --> 05:51.051
HALF AGO, WHEN THEY SAID THAT

05:51.051 --> 05:53.787
JUST A LOT OF TROOPS AND ARMOR

05:53.787 --> 05:55.755
JUST STARTED MOVING IN-COUNTRY.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.356
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, ALAN

05:56.356 --> 05:57.057
CULLISON OF THE "WALL STREET

05:57.057 --> 05:59.526
JOURNAL," THANKS SO MUCH.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.194
>> THANK YOU.

06:01.194 --> 06:01.561
>> Sreenivasan: FORMER

06:01.561 --> 06:02.829
UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE NICHOLAS

06:02.829 --> 06:04.097
BURNS WILL JOIN US TO DISCUSS

06:04.097 --> 06:05.966
AMERICAN OPTIONS IN UKRAINE

06:05.966 --> 06:07.000
IN A MOMENT.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.134
NEAR THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, ALONG

06:08.134 --> 06:09.402
THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND

06:09.402 --> 06:11.371
SYRIA, 32 UNITED NATIONS

06:11.371 --> 06:12.205
PEACEKEEPERS FROM THE

06:12.205 --> 06:14.074
PHILIPPINES CAME UNDER FIRE FROM

06:14.074 --> 06:16.109
ISLAMIC MILITANTS BEFORE BEING

06:16.109 --> 06:17.177
BROUGHT TO SAFETY.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.311
LATER IN THE DAY, U.N. ARMORED

06:18.311 --> 06:19.679
VEHICLES WERE OBSERVED RETURNING

06:19.679 --> 06:21.014
TO THEIR BASE IN ISRAELI-

06:21.014 --> 06:22.382
CONTROLLED TERRITORY.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.084
MORE THAN 40 OTHER PEACEKEEPERS

06:24.084 --> 06:26.119
FROM FIJI ARE STILL SURROUNDED

06:26.119 --> 06:27.821
BY ISLAMISTS IN SYRIA AND ARE

06:27.821 --> 06:29.556
REPORTED TO BE UNDER MORTAR AND

06:29.556 --> 06:31.791
HEAVY MACHINE GUNFIRE.

06:31.791 --> 06:32.892
THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA IS

06:32.892 --> 06:34.194
WARNING OF TERROR ATTACKS IN

06:34.194 --> 06:35.595
EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES

06:35.595 --> 06:37.063
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR

06:37.063 --> 06:37.964
UNLESS THE INTERNATIONAL

06:37.964 --> 06:39.499
COMMUNITY MOVES SWIFTLY TO

06:39.499 --> 06:41.268
CONFRONT THE ISLAMIC STATE.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.168
IN COMMENTS TO FOREIGN

06:42.168 --> 06:43.136
AMBASSADORS YESTERDAY, KING

AM CERTAIN THAT AFTER A MONTH

06:46.072 --> 06:47.507
THEY WILL REACH EUROPE, AND,

06:47.507 --> 06:49.476
AFTER ANOTHER MONTH, AMERICA."

06:49.476 --> 06:50.710
YESTERDAY, BRITAIN RAISED ITS

06:50.710 --> 06:52.846
TERROR THREAT LEVEL TO SEVERE,

06:52.846 --> 06:53.880
MEANING IT CONSIDERS AN ATTACK

06:53.880 --> 06:56.549
HIGHLY LIKELY BUT NOT IMMINENT.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.784
FROM MONROVIA, THE CAPITAL OF

PEOPLE SO FAR, AND, THE WORLD

07:13.233 --> 07:14.200
HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAID THE

07:14.200 --> 07:16.069
NUMBER OF CASES ROSE LAST WEEK

07:16.069 --> 07:18.104
AT THE FASTEST PACE SINCE THE

07:18.104 --> 07:21.041
OUTBREAK BEGAN FIVE MONTHS AGO.

07:21.041 --> 07:21.941
PROMISING MEDICAL NEWS TONIGHT.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.243
AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG MADE BY

07:23.243 --> 07:25.178
NOVARTIS LOWERS THE CHANCE OF

07:25.178 --> 07:26.913
DEATH OR HOSPITALIZATION FROM

EFFECTIVELY.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.121
THE COMPANY WILL SEEK APPROVAL

07:35.121 --> 07:36.890
OF THE STILL UNNAMED DRUG BY THE

07:36.890 --> 07:38.625
END OF THE YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.959
THE RESULTS, PUBLISHED TODAY IN

07:39.959 --> 07:40.994
THE "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF

07:40.994 --> 07:42.262
MEDICINE," WERE OBTAINED DURING

07:42.262 --> 07:43.563
A STUDY INVOLVING MORE THAN

07:43.563 --> 07:46.700
8,500 PEOPLE IN 47 COUNTRIES.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.034
THE STUDY WAS CUT SHORT BY

07:48.034 --> 07:49.102
SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE THE

07:49.102 --> 07:51.204
RESULTS WERE SO PROMISING.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.439
CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS HAVE PASSED

07:52.439 --> 07:53.740
A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE THE STATE

07:53.740 --> 07:55.208
THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO

07:55.208 --> 07:56.976
PROHIBIT SUPERMARKETS, LIQUOR

07:56.976 --> 07:58.511
STORES, PHARMACIES AND OTHER

07:58.511 --> 08:00.080
BUSINESSES FROM USING PLASTIC

08:00.080 --> 08:00.947
BAGS.

08:00.947 --> 08:01.881
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY PLASTIC

08:01.881 --> 08:03.216
BAGS ARE RARELY RECYCLED AND

08:03.216 --> 08:04.718
OFTEN END UP IN THE OCEAN,

08:04.718 --> 08:05.885
HARMING SEA LIFE.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.220
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN MUST STILL

08:07.220 --> 08:08.988
SIGN THE BILL INTO LAW.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.590
IN ANOTHER MATTER, BROWN’S

08:10.590 --> 08:11.891
ADMINISTRATION IS APPEALING

08:11.891 --> 08:13.793
JUNE’S COURT RULING WHICH

08:13.793 --> 08:15.762
EFFECTIVELY BANNED TENURE FOR

08:15.762 --> 08:17.330
TEACHERS IN THAT STATE.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.465
THE COURT HAD RULED THAT THE

08:18.465 --> 08:20.200
STATE’S TENURE SYSTEM VIOLATED

08:20.200 --> 08:21.668
THE STATE’S CONSTITUTION BY

08:21.668 --> 08:24.070
DENYING SOME OF CALIFORNIA’S SIX

08:24.070 --> 08:25.672
MILLION STUDENTS A QUALITY

08:25.672 --> 08:26.706
EDUCATION.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.174
REPUBLICAN LEADERS CRITICIZED

08:28.174 --> 08:29.275
THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION’S

08:29.275 --> 08:30.810
DECISION TO APPEAL.

08:30.810 --> 08:31.945
THE STATE SAYS THE JUDGE HAD

08:31.945 --> 08:33.613
FAILED TO SPELL OUT ADEQUATE

08:33.613 --> 08:36.449
LEGAL GROUNDS FOR HIS DECISION.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.118
A FEDERAL COURT IN TEXAS HAS

08:38.118 --> 08:39.853
STRUCK DOWN MAJOR PARTS OF A LAW

08:39.853 --> 08:40.687
THAT WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED

08:40.687 --> 08:42.322
ABORTIONS IN THAT STATE.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.857
THE LAW, WHICH WAS TO HAVE GONE

08:43.857 --> 08:45.458
INTO EFFECT MONDAY, WOULD HAVE

08:45.458 --> 08:47.394
REQUIRED ABORTION CLINICS TO

08:47.394 --> 08:48.895
MEET HOSPITAL BUILDING

08:48.895 --> 08:50.196
STANDARDS, LIKE WIDENING

08:50.196 --> 08:52.132
HALLWAYS, BEFORE CONDUCTING

08:52.132 --> 08:53.466
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.567
THE JUDGE SAID THE LAW WOULD

08:54.567 --> 08:56.336
HAVE PLACED AN UNDUE BURDEN ON

08:56.336 --> 08:58.438
WOMEN IN PART BECAUSE SOME WOMEN

08:58.438 --> 09:00.473
WOULD HAVE HAD TO TRAVEL 500

09:00.473 --> 09:02.409
MILES TO GET AN ABORTION.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.277
AND THE RARE INTACT SKELETAL

09:04.277 --> 09:05.879
REMAINS OF A MAN THOUGHT TO HAVE

09:05.879 --> 09:08.214
LIVED MORE THAN 6,000 YEARS AGO

09:08.214 --> 09:09.949
HAVE GONE ON DISPLAY AT THE PENN

09:09.949 --> 09:11.351
MUSEUM IN PHILADELPHIA.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.018
THE REMAINS WERE FIRST

09:12.018 --> 09:13.787
DISCOVERED IN 1930 IN WHAT IS

09:13.787 --> 09:15.722
NOW SOUTHERN IRAQ, BUT SAT IN

09:15.722 --> 09:17.690
STORAGE IN THE MUSEUM’S BASEMENT

09:17.690 --> 09:18.725
EVER SINCE.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.326
THEY WERE FOUND IN AN UNMARKED

09:20.326 --> 09:21.995
BOX ONLY AFTER THE MUSEUM

09:21.995 --> 09:23.363
STARTED DIGITIZING ITS

09:23.363 --> 09:25.131
COLLECTION AND COULDN’T ACCOUNT

09:25.131 --> 09:26.232
FOR THE ITEM.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.346
>> Sreenivasan: RETURNING NOW TO

09:40.346 --> 09:41.381
THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.715
FOR MORE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT

09:42.715 --> 09:44.050
OPTIONS THE UNITED STATES AND

09:44.050 --> 09:45.985
ITS WESTERN ALLIES HAVE TO DEAL

09:45.985 --> 09:47.253
WITH THE RUSSIAN MILITARY

09:47.253 --> 09:48.655
INTERVENTION THERE, WE ARE

09:48.655 --> 09:49.823
JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

09:49.823 --> 09:51.191
WESTPORT, MASSACHUSETTS, BY

09:51.191 --> 09:52.091
NICHOLAS BURNS.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.626
HE IS A FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF

09:53.626 --> 09:55.094
STATE AND NOW A PROFESSOR AT THE

09:55.094 --> 09:56.162
HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL OF

09:56.162 --> 09:57.096
GOVERNMENT.

09:57.096 --> 09:57.764
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.066
SO WHAT SHOULD THE WEST’S ROLE

10:00.066 --> 10:01.234
BE HERE?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.735
WHAT’S THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE

10:02.735 --> 10:04.370
BETWEEN DIPLOMACY AND MILITARY

10:04.370 --> 10:06.172
ACTION?

10:06.172 --> 10:07.207
>> WELL, HARI, THIS IS A MAJOR

10:07.207 --> 10:08.475
TURNING POINT IN THE CRISIS

10:08.475 --> 10:10.009
BECAUSE PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS NOW

10:10.009 --> 10:12.145
PUT RUSSIAN SOLDIERS, RUSSIAN

10:12.145 --> 10:13.713
MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT OVER THE

10:13.713 --> 10:15.148
BORDER INTO UKRAINE.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.316
THEY’VE ENCIRCLED THE UKRAINIAN

10:16.316 --> 10:17.784
MILITARY, THEY’VE TURNED THE

10:17.784 --> 10:19.152
TIDE OF THIS WAR.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.887
IT’S AN OUTRIGHT VIOLATION OF

10:20.887 --> 10:21.888
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.256
SO I THINK THAT THE WEST HAS

10:23.256 --> 10:25.158
THREE OPTIONS AHEAD OF IT, AND

10:25.158 --> 10:26.226
THERE WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT

10:26.226 --> 10:27.627
NATO SUMMIT MEETING NEXT WEEK IN

10:27.627 --> 10:29.362
WALES TO CONSIDER THIS.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.364
NUMBER ONE, STRONGER SANCTIONS

10:31.364 --> 10:32.866
AGAINST THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT

10:32.866 --> 10:34.067
AND THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.736
AND THIS WILL MEAN VERY SEVERE

10:36.736 --> 10:38.238
FINANCIAL SANCTIONS, THE KIND OF

10:38.238 --> 10:40.073
SANCTIONS THAT WILL REALLY DRIVE

10:40.073 --> 10:41.608
UP THE COST TO PRESIDENT PUTIN

10:41.608 --> 10:42.842
FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.911
SECOND, THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

10:44.911 --> 10:47.213
IS ASKING FOR SOPHISTICATED ARMS

10:47.213 --> 10:48.615
TRANSFERS FROM EUROPE AND THE

10:48.615 --> 10:50.717
UNITED STATES, AND INTELLIGENCE

10:50.717 --> 10:52.685
SUPPORT SO THEY CAN FIGHT BACK

10:52.685 --> 10:54.554
AND CONTROL ITS OWN TERRITORY.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.755
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA’S BEEN

10:55.755 --> 10:57.690
VERY CLEAR, AND RIGHTLY SO, THE

10:57.690 --> 10:59.325
UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO GO

10:59.325 --> 11:01.694
TO WAR WITH RUSSIA OVER UKRAINE,

11:01.694 --> 11:02.629
BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE AN

11:02.629 --> 11:04.130
INTEREST IN HELPING THE

11:04.130 --> 11:05.899
UKRAINIANS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES

11:05.899 --> 11:07.467
AND DEFEND THE TERRITORY.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.435
AND THIRD, CONTINUED ECONOMIC

11:09.435 --> 11:09.836
SUPPORT.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.970
BUT HERE THE EUROPEANS SHOULD

11:10.970 --> 11:13.039
TAKE THE LEAD, LED BY GERMANY,

11:13.039 --> 11:14.607
BECAUSE THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMY,

11:14.607 --> 11:16.543
AS YOU KNOW, IS FALTERING, AND

11:16.543 --> 11:18.611
IT NEEDS A DRAMATIC INFUSION OF

11:18.611 --> 11:19.913
WESTERN CAPITAL.

11:19.913 --> 11:20.547
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE ANY

11:20.547 --> 11:21.548
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE

11:21.548 --> 11:22.749
SANCTIONS WILL WORK?

11:22.749 --> 11:24.017
WE’VE IMPOSED SOME SANCTIONS ON

11:24.017 --> 11:25.151
RUSSIA, AND SO HAVE THE

11:25.151 --> 11:25.718
EUROPEANS.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.519
IT JUST SEEMS THAT THEY’VE

11:26.519 --> 11:28.888
ESCALATED NOW INTO A SANCTIONS

11:28.888 --> 11:30.723
WAR.

11:30.723 --> 11:31.758
>> IT’S REALLY THE ONLY PRESSURE

11:31.758 --> 11:33.159
POINT THAT THE WEST HAS RIGHT

11:33.159 --> 11:34.794
NOW BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE’VE

11:34.794 --> 11:36.462
RIGHTLY GIVEN UP THE

11:36.462 --> 11:37.764
ALTERNATIVE OF WAR.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.365
IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE LEGALLY OR

11:39.365 --> 11:41.200
POLITICALLY FOR US TO TANGLE

11:41.200 --> 11:42.602
WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.803
WE’RE TWO NUCLEAR WEAPONS

11:43.803 --> 11:44.604
COUNTRIES.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.005
SO IT’S REALLY THE RUSSIAN

11:46.005 --> 11:47.407
ECONOMY THAT’S VULNERABLE.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.975
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS VERY MUCH

11:48.975 --> 11:50.476
INTEGRATED, PARTICULARLY WITH

11:50.476 --> 11:51.377
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.446
IT DEPENDS ON INFUSIONS OF

11:53.446 --> 11:54.914
INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.316
IT DEPENDS ON MANUFACTURED

11:56.316 --> 11:58.551
IMPORTS FROM EUROPE, ESPECIALLY.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.119
AND IF THE EUROPEANS WILL AGREE

12:00.119 --> 12:01.854
TO SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL

12:01.854 --> 12:04.057
SANCTIONS, MUCH STRONGER THAN

12:04.057 --> 12:04.958
THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF

12:04.958 --> 12:06.159
SANCTIONS OVER THE LAST FIVE

12:06.159 --> 12:08.294
MONTHS, THAT WILL BE THE BEST

12:08.294 --> 12:10.063
WAY TO GET PUTIN’S ATTENTION AND

12:10.063 --> 12:12.131
TO SHOW HIM, DEMONSTRATE TO HIM,

12:12.131 --> 12:13.333
THAT THERE’S A REAL COST FOR

12:13.333 --> 12:14.667
WHAT HE’S DONE IN VIOLATING

12:14.667 --> 12:16.536
INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE WAY

12:16.536 --> 12:17.403
HE’S DONE SO.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.671
>> Sreenivasan: IF WE BEGIN ARMS

12:18.671 --> 12:20.173
TRANSFERS, ARE WE ESSENTIALLY

12:20.173 --> 12:21.741
ENGAGING IN THE EQUIVALENT OF A

12:21.741 --> 12:24.577
PROXY WAR AGAINST RUSSIA?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.678
>> NO, WE’RE SIMPLY HELPING A

12:25.678 --> 12:26.946
FRIENDLY COUNTRY.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.281
AND UKRAINE, FOR THE LAST 15

12:28.281 --> 12:30.249
YEARS, HAS BEEN A FRIENDLY

12:30.249 --> 12:32.318
COUNTRY TO THE NATO ALLIES,

12:32.318 --> 12:33.486
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.454
WE’RE HELPING THAT COUNTRY

12:34.454 --> 12:36.022
DEFEND ITSELF, PROTECT ITS

12:36.022 --> 12:38.091
BORDERS, POLICE ITS STREETS,

12:38.091 --> 12:40.126
TAKE BACK TWO BIG CITIES,

12:40.126 --> 12:41.761
DONETSK AND LUHANSK, IN

12:41.761 --> 12:42.729
THE EASTERN PART OF THE

12:42.729 --> 12:44.263
COUNTRY THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR

12:44.263 --> 12:45.498
THE SURVIVAL OF AN INTEGRATED

12:45.498 --> 12:46.432
UKRAINE.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.301
AND I THINK THE REASON TO DO SO,

12:48.301 --> 12:49.669
HARI, IS THAT THE PRINCIPLE AT

12:49.669 --> 12:52.138
STAKE HERE IS SO IMPORTANT.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.606
AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR, WE

12:53.606 --> 12:55.475
ACHIEVED A DEMOCRATIC PEACE IN

12:55.475 --> 12:56.743
EUROPE, SOMETHING THAT EUROPE

12:56.743 --> 12:58.578
HAD NOT BEEN FOR CENTURIES.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.146
THAT’S NOW ALL AT RISK BECAUSE

13:00.146 --> 13:02.815
PUTIN VERY CYNICALLY IS USING

13:02.815 --> 13:04.851
FORCE TO DIVIDE COUNTRIES AND

13:04.851 --> 13:06.119
DRAW NEW DIVIDING LINES IN

13:06.119 --> 13:06.486
EUROPE.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.154
SO IT’S THAT IMPORTANT THAT THE

13:08.154 --> 13:09.188
UNITED STATES AND THE WEST

13:09.188 --> 13:11.090
EUROPEANS GET ENGAGED HERE,

13:11.090 --> 13:12.191
AND NEXT WEEK’S GOING TO BE AN

13:12.191 --> 13:13.159
IMPORTANT WEEK.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.560
WE’LL KNOW THE ANSWER.

13:14.560 --> 13:14.994
>> Sreenivasan: SO HOW

13:14.994 --> 13:16.996
CONSEQUENTIAL IS UKRAINE’S

13:16.996 --> 13:19.298
ATTEMPT TO JOIN NATO, AND HOW

13:19.298 --> 13:21.868
LONG WOULD THAT PROCESS TAKE?

13:21.868 --> 13:23.202
>> YOU KNOW, UKRAINE HAS BEEN A

13:23.202 --> 13:24.837
PARTNER OF NATO SINCE THE LATE

13:24.837 --> 13:25.972
1990s.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.173
IT’S NOT AT ALL REALISTIC THAT

13:27.173 --> 13:28.374
UKRAINE WILL BECOME A MEMBER OF

13:28.374 --> 13:29.142
NATO.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.410
GIVEN THE FACT THAT UKRAINE IS

13:30.410 --> 13:32.245
FRACTURED-- IT HAS THESE MASSIVE

13:32.245 --> 13:33.479
TERRITORIAL DISPUTES WITH

13:33.479 --> 13:35.782
RUSSIA-- UKRAINE CAN HOPE TO BE

13:35.782 --> 13:37.016
A PARTNER... CONTINUE TO BE A

13:37.016 --> 13:38.184
PARTNER OF NATO, TO WORK WITH

13:38.184 --> 13:39.385
IT, BUT I THINK WHAT THE

13:39.385 --> 13:41.421
UKRAINIANS NEED AND WANT MOST,

13:41.421 --> 13:42.522
HARI, IS NOT NATO

13:42.522 --> 13:44.290
MEMBERSHIP; THEY WANT TO TRADE

13:44.290 --> 13:45.758
RELATIONSHIP WITH A EUROPEAN

13:45.758 --> 13:46.059
UNION.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.160
THEY WON’T BE A MEMBER OF THE

13:47.160 --> 13:49.362
EUROPEAN UNION ANY TIME SOON, AS

13:49.362 --> 13:51.064
WELL, BUT THEY NEED THE TRADE.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.065
THEY NEED THE CAPITAL

13:52.065 --> 13:52.932
INVESTMENT.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.333
THEY NEED THE ECONOMIC

13:54.333 --> 13:55.702
ASSISTANCE THAT SOME KIND OF

13:55.702 --> 13:57.603
ASSOCIATION, A PARTNERSHIP

13:57.603 --> 13:58.938
ASSOCIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN

13:58.938 --> 13:59.939
UNION WOULD HAVE.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.774
AND REMEMBER, PRESIDENT PUTIN’S

14:01.774 --> 14:03.109
INVASION OF CRIMEA, AND

14:03.109 --> 14:04.644
EVERYTHING HE’S DONE WAS

14:04.644 --> 14:05.945
PRECIPITATED BY THE FACT THAT

14:05.945 --> 14:07.680
THE UKRAINIANS WERE THREATENING

14:07.680 --> 14:09.382
A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE

14:09.382 --> 14:10.116
EUROPEAN UNION.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.485
HE IS THAT PARANOID ABOUT STATES

14:12.485 --> 14:14.487
ALONG HIS PERIPHERY LOOKING

14:14.487 --> 14:17.056
WEST AS OPPOSED TO EAST.

14:17.056 --> 14:17.623
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT

14:17.623 --> 14:19.425
THIS IDEA OF NOVO RUSSIA,

14:19.425 --> 14:20.893
SOMETHING THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE

14:20.893 --> 14:22.428
SAID, "SURE, WE’LL STOP ALL OF

14:22.428 --> 14:23.730
THIS IF WE CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND

14:23.730 --> 14:25.598
ANNEX THIS PORTION OF UKRAINE

14:25.598 --> 14:26.833
BACK."

14:26.833 --> 14:28.234
IT SEEMS THAT WHETHER WE LIKE IT

14:28.234 --> 14:29.402
OR NOT, THEY’VE ALREADY SENT THE

14:29.402 --> 14:31.571
TROOPS IN AND ARE IN FACT TAKING

14:31.571 --> 14:33.740
OVER THAT PART OF UKRAINE.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.608
>> WELL, IT’S A VERY UNSETTLING

14:35.608 --> 14:37.510
AND DESTABILIZING CONCEPT THAT

14:37.510 --> 14:39.645
YOU’D SAY THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT

14:39.645 --> 14:41.047
AS RUSSIANS TO UNITE ALL THE

14:41.047 --> 14:43.015
RUSSIANS OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF

14:43.015 --> 14:43.750
RUSSIA.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.051
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RUSSIAN

14:45.051 --> 14:46.419
POPULATIONS, OF COURSE, IN

14:46.419 --> 14:48.621
UKRAINE, BUT ALSO IN MOLDAVIA,

14:48.621 --> 14:50.857
IN BELARUS, IN KAZAKHSTAN AND

14:50.857 --> 14:52.825
UZBEKISTAN.

14:52.825 --> 14:53.926
SHOULD WE SUPPORT THE RUSSIAN

14:53.926 --> 14:55.261
GOVERNMENT’S RIGHT TO MARCH INTO

14:55.261 --> 14:57.029
THOSE COUNTRIES, TAKE OVER

14:57.029 --> 14:58.331
PORTIONS OF THOSE COUNTRIES

14:58.331 --> 15:00.032
SIMPLY BECAUSE ETHNIC RUSSIANS

15:00.032 --> 15:01.501
ARE LIVING THERE?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.236
THIS IS AN INEXACT COMPARISON,

15:03.236 --> 15:04.904
OF COURSE, BUT THAT WAS

15:04.904 --> 15:07.340
ESSENTIALLY THE PHILOSOPHY OF

15:07.340 --> 15:08.775
THE NAZI PARTY IN GERMANY IN THE

15:08.775 --> 15:10.109
THE 1930S, THAT WE WOULD...

15:10.109 --> 15:11.711
THEY WOULD UNITE THE GERMANS

15:11.711 --> 15:13.679
LIVING OUTSIDE THE GERMAN REICH.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.314
IT’S A VERY DANGEROUS,

15:15.314 --> 15:16.949
DESTABILIZING CONCEPT.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.217
WE VOWED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD

15:18.217 --> 15:19.852
WAR WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT KIND

15:19.852 --> 15:21.554
OF ACTION IN EUROPE, AND HERE IT

15:21.554 --> 15:22.855
IS WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WITH

15:22.855 --> 15:25.992
HIS NOVO RUSSIA CONCEPT, WHICH

15:25.992 --> 15:27.326
IS DANGEROUS, AND IT DESERVES...

15:27.326 --> 15:29.295
IT NEEDS TO BE OPPOSED BY THE

15:29.295 --> 15:30.530
UNITED STATES AND BY THE WEST

15:30.530 --> 15:31.430
EUROPEANS.

15:31.430 --> 15:31.731
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

15:31.731 --> 15:32.532
NICHOLAS BURNS, THANKS SO MUCH

15:32.532 --> 15:33.833
FOR YOUR TIME.

15:33.833 --> 15:34.700
>> THANK YOU.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.604
>>KEEP UP WITH THE DAY’S NEWS

15:38.604 --> 15:39.872
IN REAL TIME.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.474
READ NEWSHOUR’S RUNDOWN BLOG AT

15:41.474 --> 15:43.810
newshour.pbs.org.

15:46.412 --> 15:46.879
>> Sreenivasan: THE ISLAMIC

15:46.879 --> 15:47.914
STATE HAS ENTERED OUR

15:47.914 --> 15:49.115
CONSCIOUSNESS FOR MULTIPLE

15:49.115 --> 15:49.982
REASONS.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.350
PARTLY FOR THE SAVAGERY THEY’RE

15:51.350 --> 15:53.119
WILLING TO COMMIT, AND ALSO

15:53.119 --> 15:54.587
BECAUSE OF THE SAVVY THEY

15:54.587 --> 15:56.022
DISPLAY IN SPREADING THEIR

15:56.022 --> 15:56.756
MESSAGE.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.090
FOR SOME ANALYSIS, YESTERDAY I

15:58.090 --> 15:59.292
SPOKE WITH SHADI HAMID OF THE

15:59.292 --> 16:00.760
BROOKINGS INSTITUTION AND AUTHOR

16:00.760 --> 16:02.662
OF "TEMPTATIONS OF POWER:

16:02.662 --> 16:03.896
ISLAMISTS AND ILLIBERAL

16:03.896 --> 16:05.932
DEMOCRACY IN A NEW MIDDLE EAST";

16:05.932 --> 16:07.667
AND PHILIP SMYTHE A RESEARCHER

16:07.667 --> 16:08.935
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

16:08.935 --> 16:10.102
AND BLOGGER AT HIZBALLAH

16:10.102 --> 16:11.838
CAVALCADE, WHO STUDIES ISLAMIC

16:11.838 --> 16:13.272
EXTREMISM.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.608
SHADI HAMID, COMPARE THESE GUYS

16:15.608 --> 16:16.909
TO AL QAEDA.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.477
IT SEEMS THAT WE WERE ALMOST

16:18.477 --> 16:20.146
BETTER OFF GETTING THESE GRAINY

16:20.146 --> 16:21.981
VIDEOTAPES FROM OSAMA BIN LADEN

16:21.981 --> 16:23.449
OUT OF A CAVE, COMPARED TO WHAT

16:23.449 --> 16:25.418
WE’RE SEEING TODAY.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.986
>> SO, ISIS ARE QUITE ADVANCED

16:26.986 --> 16:28.321
IN THEIR MARKETING AND MEDIA

16:28.321 --> 16:29.088
STRATEGY.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.356
THEY’VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE ON

16:30.356 --> 16:31.424
TWITTER.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.592
AND FOR THOSE OF US ON THE

16:32.592 --> 16:33.960
OUTSIDE TRYING TO FOLLOW THEM,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.062
YOU CAN ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH

16:36.062 --> 16:38.130
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ON TWITTER

16:38.130 --> 16:39.265
AND THEY’RE ACTIVELY TWEETING

16:39.265 --> 16:41.968
ABOUT SOMEWHAT MUNDANE THINGS.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.002
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TWITTER

16:43.002 --> 16:45.438
MEME WHERE ISIS FIGHTERS WERE

16:45.438 --> 16:47.773
EATING UP JARS OF NUTELLA.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.108
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ALSO

16:49.108 --> 16:50.610
SEE VERY SAVAGE THINGS LIKE

16:50.610 --> 16:51.143
BEHEADINGS.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.378
SO THERE IS A KIND OF STRANGE

16:52.378 --> 16:54.847
DUALITY, A SCHIZOPHRENIA THAT

16:54.847 --> 16:56.015
THEY’RE SHOWING THIS DARK,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.884
BRUTAL SIDE, BUT THEY’RE ALSO

16:57.884 --> 16:59.919
TRYING TO SHOW-- AT LEAST AS

16:59.919 --> 17:01.320
THEY MIGHT SEE IT-- A MORE

17:01.320 --> 17:03.089
HUMANE SIDE TO WESTERN

17:03.089 --> 17:03.756
AUDIENCES.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.591
AND THOSE... WE’RE NOT GOING TO

17:05.591 --> 17:07.960
BUY THAT AS AMERICANS, BUT FOR

17:07.960 --> 17:10.096
PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY

17:10.096 --> 17:12.265
SYMPATHETIC OR FENCE-SITTERS,

17:12.265 --> 17:14.400
SEEING THOSE IMAGES CAN ACTUALLY

17:14.400 --> 17:15.568
BE APPEALING.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.035
>> Sreenivasan: SO, PHILIP

17:16.035 --> 17:18.137
SMYTH, IT SEEMS IN THE PAST, IT

17:18.137 --> 17:20.139
WAS GUYS HOLDING MACHINE GUNS IN

17:20.139 --> 17:21.974
THE BACKDROP OF A VIDEO.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.743
"THIS IS HOW TOUGH I AM."

17:23.743 --> 17:25.044
IT SEEMS NOW THE BAR IS, I HAVE

17:25.044 --> 17:26.679
TO BE HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD IN AN

17:26.679 --> 17:27.980
INSTAGRAM.

17:27.980 --> 17:28.915
>> WE’VE SEEN STUFF LIKE THIS

17:28.915 --> 17:29.949
BEFORE.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.851
IT’S NOT REALLY THAT NEW.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.386
I MEAN, IT’S JUST THE PLATFORMS

17:33.386 --> 17:34.520
THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED--

17:34.520 --> 17:35.821
TWITTER, INSTAGRAM YOU

17:35.821 --> 17:37.556
MENTIONED, FACEBOOK.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.392
THERE IS NOW DIRECT OUTREACH

17:39.392 --> 17:40.226
TO THE PEOPLE THEY WISH TO

17:40.226 --> 17:41.494
RECRUIT AND THE PEOPLE THEY

17:41.494 --> 17:43.863
WISH TO INFLUENCE.

17:43.863 --> 17:44.864
>> Sreenivasan: WHY IS THIS

17:44.864 --> 17:45.731
ESCALATION?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.099
I MEAN, IS IT AN ESCALATION OF

17:47.099 --> 17:49.001
THE SAVAGERY?

17:49.001 --> 17:49.969
DO THESE GROUPS FEEL LIKE

17:49.969 --> 17:52.305
THERE’S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.907
WHY GO TO THESE EXTREMES NOW?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.042
>> WELL, ONE THING THAT ISIS

17:56.042 --> 17:58.244
WANTS TO DO IS INSTILL TERROR IN

17:58.244 --> 17:59.779
THE HEARTS OF THEIR OPPONENTS.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.581
SO, WHEN, SAY, THE IRAQI ARMY OR

18:02.581 --> 18:04.550
THE SYRIAN ARMY SEE IMAGES OF

18:04.550 --> 18:06.986
BEHEADING AND MASS EXECUTIONS,

18:06.986 --> 18:08.254
THEY THINK TO THEMSELVES IF THEY

18:08.254 --> 18:10.323
GET CAUGHT BY ISIS FIGHTERS,

18:10.323 --> 18:12.058
THAT’S WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.826
SO THAT REALLY HURTS THE MORALE

18:13.826 --> 18:15.962
OF ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO FIGHT

18:15.962 --> 18:17.596
ISIS, AND WE SAW THAT IN A VERY

18:17.596 --> 18:19.799
STRIKING FASHION WITH THE IRAQI

18:19.799 --> 18:20.766
ARMY.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.069
ISIS WAS GOING INTO MOSUL WITH A

18:23.069 --> 18:24.904
MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF FIGHTERS,

18:24.904 --> 18:26.572
BUT THE IRAQI ARMY JUST

18:26.572 --> 18:28.374
ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVED.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.176
AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY

18:30.176 --> 18:31.944
WERE HEARING ALL THESE STORIES

18:31.944 --> 18:34.613
ABOUT THE MILITARY PROWESS AND

18:34.613 --> 18:36.048
THE SAVAGERY OF THE ISIS

18:36.048 --> 18:36.949
FIGHTERS.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.484
SO IT DOES REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT

18:38.484 --> 18:40.186
ON THE BATTLE FIELD.

18:40.186 --> 18:40.820
>> Sreenivasan: PHILIP SMYTH,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.288
HE MENTIONED EARLIER, KIND OF

18:42.288 --> 18:43.456
ALMOST A HIJACKING OF

18:43.456 --> 18:44.590
CONVERSATIONS.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.424
THEY’RE NOT TRYING TO HIJACK

18:45.424 --> 18:46.258
AIRCRAFT.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.493
THEY’RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE

18:47.493 --> 18:48.461
CONSCIOUSNESS OF PEOPLE

18:48.461 --> 18:49.395
WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING

18:49.395 --> 18:51.297
FROM NUTELLA TO THE ICE BUCKET

18:51.297 --> 18:52.231
CHALLENGE.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.099
>> CORRECT.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.767
THEY WANT TO HAVE A FULL SWEEP.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.935
IF YOU’RE TRYING TO CAST ANY

18:55.935 --> 18:57.436
KIND OF A NARRATIVE, YOU WANT TO

18:57.436 --> 18:59.472
LOOK AS... SOMETIMES AVERAGE AS

18:59.472 --> 19:00.406
POSSIBLE.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.608
IF SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO RECRUIT

19:02.608 --> 19:04.543
ME, THEY’RE GOING TO WANT TO

19:04.543 --> 19:05.811
INTERACT WITH ME LIKE THEY WERE

19:05.811 --> 19:07.747
A FRIEND, LIKE... EVEN LIKE HOW

19:07.747 --> 19:08.914
WE’RE TALKING NOW.

19:08.914 --> 19:09.849
IT’S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST

19:09.849 --> 19:11.450
WAYS TO GET IN AND INFLUENCE

19:11.450 --> 19:12.718
SOMEBODY’S MIND.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.219
>> Sreenivasan: SO SOME OF

19:13.219 --> 19:14.954
THIS IS COMING INTO OR ACROSS

19:14.954 --> 19:16.822
OUR RADARS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE

19:16.822 --> 19:18.491
UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.125
WE’VE HAD THIS LARGER

19:19.125 --> 19:20.259
CONVERSATION OF WESTERNERS

19:20.259 --> 19:21.293
BECOMING RADICALIZED, BUT IT’S

19:21.293 --> 19:22.495
ALSO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE

19:22.495 --> 19:23.996
DIFFERENCE OF WHAT THE WEST IS

19:23.996 --> 19:25.131
TALKING ABOUT.

19:25.131 --> 19:25.865
>> SO THERE’S AN IMPORTANT

19:25.865 --> 19:26.899
DISTINCTION HERE.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.067
THE HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC STATE,

19:28.067 --> 19:29.335
BAGHDADI, IT’S NOT AS IF HE

19:29.335 --> 19:30.836
HIMSELF IS TWEETING OR ANY OF

19:30.836 --> 19:31.937
THE OTHER SENIOR FIGURES AROUND

19:31.937 --> 19:32.571
HIM.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.706
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE YOUNGER

19:33.706 --> 19:36.042
FIGHTERS ON THE GROUND, MANY OF

19:36.042 --> 19:37.576
WHOM ARE ENGLISH SPEAKING, AND

19:37.576 --> 19:39.912
MANY OF WHOM ARE EUROPEAN, EVEN

19:39.912 --> 19:41.580
A FEW THAT ARE AMERICAN.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.516
SO FOR THEM, THEY GREW UP WITH

19:43.516 --> 19:44.617
TWITTER, THEY GREW UP WITH

19:44.617 --> 19:46.452
INSTAGRAM.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.987
TWITTER IS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU

19:47.987 --> 19:50.890
JUST DO... DO DURING THE DAY.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.625
SO THEY GO ON THE BATTLE FIELD.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.060
THERE’S BEEN A BIG FIGHT.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.528
THEIR INSTINCT IS TO TWEET ABOUT

19:55.528 --> 19:56.462
THAT.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.196
>> Sreenivasan: THE INFLUENCE

19:57.196 --> 19:58.998
OF KIND OF AMERICAN SPEAKERS--

19:58.998 --> 20:00.332
OR I SHOULD SAY ENGLISH SPEAKERS

20:00.332 --> 20:01.834
THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN WORLD

20:01.834 --> 20:02.935
PARTICIPATING IN THIS

20:02.935 --> 20:04.203
CONVERSATION, HOW IMPORTANT IS

20:04.203 --> 20:05.971
THAT TO THE RECRUITMENT OF

20:05.971 --> 20:06.672
OTHERS?

20:06.672 --> 20:07.506
>> IT’S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.474
IF ONE OF YOUR TARGET

20:08.474 --> 20:10.209
AUDIENCES, IF THEIR SOLE

20:10.209 --> 20:11.644
LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH, THEN IT’S

20:11.644 --> 20:13.179
NECESSARY TO BRING THEM IN AS

20:13.179 --> 20:14.080
FOREIGN FIGHTERS.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.581
BUT IT’S NOT SIMPLY THAT.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.283
AS AN ANALYST, I ALSO HAVE

20:17.283 --> 20:19.685
INTERACTED WITH ISIS SUPPORTERS,

20:19.685 --> 20:21.120
AND THEY WILL TRY TO INFLUENCE

20:21.120 --> 20:22.288
MATERIAL THAT COMES OUT OF

20:22.288 --> 20:23.456
OTHER ANALYSTS.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.924
SO THEY UNDERSTAND.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.626
THIS IS KIND OF A FULL-SPECTRUM

20:27.626 --> 20:29.595
APPROACH, IF YOU WILL, TO SPREAD

20:29.595 --> 20:31.097
THEIR NARRATIVE OR TO INFLUENCE

20:31.097 --> 20:32.631
OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE

20:32.631 --> 20:33.232
WEB.

20:33.232 --> 20:33.732
>> Sreenivasan: SO ARE YOU

20:33.732 --> 20:34.900
FINDING... SAY, FOR EXAMPLE,

20:34.900 --> 20:36.202
THE STATE DEPARTMENT NOW IS KIND

20:36.202 --> 20:37.937
OF ENGAGED IN TRYING TO BATTLE

20:37.937 --> 20:39.672
THIS CONVERSATION WITH KIND OF

20:39.672 --> 20:41.107
HASHTAGS OF THEIR OWN, TRYING

20:41.107 --> 20:44.743
TO... IS THAT SUCCESSFUL AT ALL?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.512
>> SO THE STATE DEPARTMENT

20:46.512 --> 20:48.714
ACTUALLY HAS A TWIITER ACCOUNT

20:48.714 --> 20:50.216
FOCUSED ON COUNTERING SOME OF

20:50.216 --> 20:52.284
THESE JIHADIS AND EXTREMISTS

20:52.284 --> 20:54.320
ONLINE, AND SPECIFICALLY

20:54.320 --> 20:55.721
ON TWITTER.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.289
IT’S HARD TO SAY HOW EFFECTIVE

20:57.289 --> 20:58.057
THAT IS.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.592
PERHAPS IT’S BETTER THAN DOING

20:59.592 --> 21:00.326
NOTHING.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.528
BUT WE SHOULDN’T KIND OF DELUDE

21:02.528 --> 21:04.196
OURSELVES INTO THINKING THAT

21:04.196 --> 21:06.031
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAN REALLY

21:06.031 --> 21:07.666
CHANGE PEOPLE’S MINDS IN A VERY

21:07.666 --> 21:09.635
OBVIOUS WAY.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.036
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DOESN’T

21:11.036 --> 21:12.571
HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY WITH

21:12.571 --> 21:14.006
ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO BE

21:14.006 --> 21:16.542
VAGUELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE AIMS

21:16.542 --> 21:18.310
OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.712
SO IT’S NOT JUST A PROBLEM OF

21:19.712 --> 21:22.548
MESSAGE BUT ALSO THE MESSENGER.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.015
>> Sreenivasan: DOES THE U.S.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.283
GOVERNMENT HAVE NOT JUST ANY

21:24.283 --> 21:25.951
STREET CREDIBILITY BUT HAVE ANY

21:25.951 --> 21:28.020
CHANCE AT TRYING TO INTERCEPT

21:28.020 --> 21:29.421
THAT MESSAGING THAT THE ISLAMIC

21:29.421 --> 21:30.456
STATE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY

21:30.456 --> 21:31.690
SUCCESSFUL WITH?

21:31.690 --> 21:32.391
>> WELL, IN TERMS OF

21:32.391 --> 21:34.126
MONITORING RECRUITMENT, WE DO

21:34.126 --> 21:35.461
SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR

21:35.461 --> 21:37.563
ON THE N.S.A., WHICH I WOULD

21:37.563 --> 21:39.331
ASSUME MONITORS QUITE A BIT OF

21:39.331 --> 21:40.266
THIS TRAFFIC.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.967
BUT IN TERMS OF KIND OF

21:41.967 --> 21:43.202
COUNTERING THE PROPAGANDA, IT’S

21:43.202 --> 21:44.937
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE WHAT’S

21:44.937 --> 21:46.672
CALLED TROLLS.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.274
I.S. PEOPLE DO HAVE THEIR OWN

21:48.274 --> 21:49.775
TROLLS THAT WILL HARASS

21:49.775 --> 21:51.243
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS

21:51.243 --> 21:52.811
AND OTHER ANALYSTS’ ACCOUNTS,

21:52.811 --> 21:53.879
AND SOMETIMES IT’S GOOD FOR A

21:53.879 --> 21:55.181
LITTLE PUSH-BACK JUST TO SHOW

21:55.181 --> 21:56.782
THAT THE UNITED STATES IS

21:56.782 --> 21:58.851
WATCHING AND THAT OCCASIONALLY

21:58.851 --> 22:00.819
IT CAN ALSO POKE AT THEM.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.287
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:01.287 --> 22:02.354
PHILIP SMYTH, SHADI HAMID,

22:02.354 --> 22:03.322
THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.023
>> THANK YOU.

22:04.023 --> 22:04.890
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.595
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:09.595 --> 22:11.130
SATURDAY.

22:18.037 --> 22:18.737
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:18.737 --> 22:20.005
VIEWERS LIKE YOU.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.340
WE HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU ABOUT

22:21.340 --> 22:23.108
LAST SATURDAY’S SIGNATURE REPORT

22:23.108 --> 22:25.211
ON THE ACCURACY OF BACKGROUND

22:25.211 --> 22:26.378
CHECKS.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.413
JACK DEVINE WROTE US:

22:27.413 --> 22:28.480
"I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR

22:28.480 --> 22:30.516
MYSELF FOR 25 YEARS.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.584
ONCE YOU HIRE A PERSON, YOU

22:31.584 --> 22:32.785
BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR

22:32.785 --> 22:34.386
EVERYTHING THAT INDIVIDUAL DOES

22:34.386 --> 22:35.754
WHILE WORKING FOR YOU.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.156
BACKGROUND CHECKS CAN SAVE YOU A

22:37.156 --> 22:38.891
LOT OF TROUBLE AND MONEY.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.125
TROUBLE CAUSED BY DISHONEST

22:40.125 --> 22:41.760
PEOPLE YOU HIRE."

22:41.760 --> 22:43.629
FRANCES HELFAND HAD THIS TO SAY:

22:43.629 --> 22:44.763
"BACKGROUND CHECKS- AS IN

22:44.763 --> 22:46.298
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND- ARE VERY

22:46.298 --> 22:47.800
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE ENTRUSTED

22:47.800 --> 22:49.335
WITH CARING FOR VULNERABLE

22:49.335 --> 22:51.237
PEOPLE AND PERHAPS ANIMALS.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.905
I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CREDIT

22:52.905 --> 22:54.607
CHECKS AND OTHER HIGHLY PERSONAL

22:54.607 --> 22:56.342
INQUIRIES THAT INVADE AN

22:56.342 --> 22:58.344
INDIVIDUAL’S RIGHT TO PRIVACY."

22:58.344 --> 22:59.612
LEIGH GRIFFITH TOLD US:

22:59.612 --> 23:02.081
"I HAD A D.W.I. WHEN I WAS 17.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.482
I AM NOW 45.

23:03.482 --> 23:04.416
I STILL NOTE IT ON MY

23:04.416 --> 23:05.818
APPLICATION AS I AM AFRAID THEY

23:05.818 --> 23:07.419
WOULD FIND IT IN A BACKGROUND

23:07.419 --> 23:09.021
CHECK AND THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY

23:09.021 --> 23:10.556
ME FOR THE POSITION.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.824
BUT DO THEY DISQUALIFY ME

23:11.824 --> 23:13.359
AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE I ADMIT I

23:13.359 --> 23:15.060
HAD A D.W.I.?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.428
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW."

23:16.428 --> 23:18.097
JACKIE RYAN OFFERED THIS:

23:18.097 --> 23:19.898
"ME AND MY HUSBAND BOTH HAVE

23:19.898 --> 23:20.966
CRIMINAL RECORDS.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.334
WE ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO

23:22.334 --> 23:23.502
HAVE PAID THE PRICE FOR OUR

23:23.502 --> 23:24.336
CRIMES.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.171
HOWEVER, WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE

23:26.171 --> 23:27.840
TO GET BETTER THAN MANUAL LABOR

23:27.840 --> 23:30.209
JOBS DUE TO DISCRIMINATION."

23:30.209 --> 23:31.277
BUT JOHNNY MEDINA HAD A

23:31.277 --> 23:32.311
DIFFERENT TAKE:

23:32.311 --> 23:33.479
"CONSIDERING THAT I HAVE BEEN

23:33.479 --> 23:35.214
HAMPERED BY THIS FOR YEARS, I

23:35.214 --> 23:36.515
CAN SPEAK ON IT.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.417
YES, IT IS OKAY.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.518
I BROUGHT THIS TROUBLE ON

23:39.518 --> 23:40.452
MYSELF."

23:40.452 --> 23:41.787
THEN THERE ARE CASES LIKE KEVIN

23:41.787 --> 23:43.756
JONES, WHO, AS WE REPORTED, LOST

23:43.756 --> 23:45.024
A JOB OFFER BECAUSE HE WAS

23:45.024 --> 23:46.659
MISTAKEN FOR ANOTHER KEVIN

23:46.659 --> 23:47.359
JONES.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.094
BEVERLY MARLER SOWA WROTE:

23:49.094 --> 23:50.763
"GOOGLE YOUR NAME AND SEE HOW

23:50.763 --> 23:52.331
MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME NAME

23:52.331 --> 23:53.198
SHOW UP.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.533
THE CHANCES OF MIXING YOU UP

23:54.533 --> 23:56.669
WITH SOMEONE ELSE ARE HUGE."

23:56.669 --> 23:57.803
AS ALWAYS, LET US KNOW WHAT YOU

23:57.803 --> 23:59.738
THINK OF OUR STORIES ON TWITTER,

23:59.738 --> 24:02.808

24:18.023 --> 24:18.824
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:18.824 --> 24:20.059

24:20.059 --> 24:20.926

24:40.346 --> 24:41.246
THE COMPANY SAYS THEY WERE

24:41.246 --> 24:43.716
