WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:09.343
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.343 --> 00:13.680
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Amid
continued scrutiny over Hillary
Clinton's e-mails...

00:13.680 --> 00:15.983
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I don't think it
posed a national security

00:15.983 --> 00:19.653
problem. I think that it was a
mistake that she has
acknowledged

00:19.653 --> 00:23.056
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... Clinton and
four other candidates are
getting ready for the first

00:23.056 --> 00:28.662
Democratic debate. We will look
at what they're facing on
Politics Monday.

00:28.662 --> 00:33.467
And Washington Post journalist
Jason Rezaian convicted in
Tehran. Will the verdict lead

00:33.467 --> 00:37.404
to a harsh sentence
or a possible pardon?

00:37.404 --> 00:44.845
Then: discipline in schools,
concerns over how young is too
young to be suspended.

00:44.845 --> 00:49.283
And one pro basketball player
returns to his home, bringing
some hope to one of the poorest

00:49.283 --> 00:51.218
countries in the world.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.888
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Why do
you come back to Congo?

00:54.888 --> 01:00.127
BISMACK BIYOMBO, Toronto
Raptors: I love the people. I
love the potential of this
place.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.562
And I think we have
a bright future.

01:02.562 --> 01:09.803
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:09.803 --> 01:14.441
(BREAK)

01:14.441 --> 01:23.350
JUDY WOODRUFF: Political and
ethnic tensions in Turkey were
at the boiling point today

01:23.350 --> 01:27.554
after deadly bombings in
Ankara over the weekend.

01:27.554 --> 01:32.926
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television News reports on the
day's developments.

01:32.926 --> 01:44.604
JONATHAN RUGMAN: It was the
biggest bomb attack Turkey has
witnessed, the single biggest
blow to its stability in

01:44.604 --> 01:50.844
And even the death toll is
disputed, like so much else. The
pro-Kurdish opposition says

01:50.844 --> 01:58.085
128 people were killed. The
government says at least 97.
Saturday's attack was upon this

01:58.085 --> 02:03.056
peace demonstration by Kurdish
and leftist protesters.

02:03.056 --> 02:11.798
Two explosions were followed by
police tear-gassing survivors,
which only fed the assumption
that

02:11.798 --> 02:17.070
the state, or dark forces within
it, were behind the violence,
though Turkey's prime

02:17.070 --> 02:23.010
minister said today the
so-called Islamic State was the
prime suspect.

02:23.010 --> 02:27.748
MAN (through translator): It was
definitely a suicide bombing. We
have strong evidence

02:27.748 --> 02:29.816
for that.

02:29.816 --> 02:34.921
JONATHAN RUGMAN: I.S. has a
possible motive. By setting
Kurds against Turks, it may be

02:34.921 --> 02:39.926
encouraging its twin enemies to
go to war with each other
instead.

02:39.926 --> 02:44.698
At this funeral of one of the
Kurdish victims in Istanbul
today, the mourners chanted that

02:44.698 --> 02:50.203
Turkey's president was the
murderer, all this under the
watchful gaze of riot police.

02:50.203 --> 02:56.743
In the mainly Kurdish southeast,
you hear the same cry: "The
president's a murderer."

02:56.743 --> 03:02.482
MAN (through translator): Why
are they carrying out these
massacres against
revolutionaries,

03:02.482 --> 03:06.686
socialists and those that are in
favor of peace? Why can we never
have a politician

03:06.686 --> 03:09.723
or a member of government
suffering from these attacks?
This clearly shows who carried
out

03:09.723 --> 03:12.292
this massacre.

03:12.292 --> 03:17.898
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Just up the
road from that funeral, Turkish
troops are advancing after

03:17.898 --> 03:24.104
airstrikes against the Kurdish
PKK. The government's up for
reelection in just three weeks'
time,

03:24.104 --> 03:28.842
and by appearing strong, is not
letting this national security
crisis go to waste.

03:28.842 --> 03:33.580
JUDY WOODRUFF: The violence in
Turkey has spiked since another
bombing in July that

03:33.580 --> 03:40.053
killed 33 people. That sparked
renewed fighting between the
military and the Kurdish PKK
rebels.

03:40.053 --> 03:46.493
In Afghanistan, fighting
intensified today as Taliban
forces attacked a new city. This

03:46.493 --> 03:51.264
time, the battles centered
around Ghazni, southwest of
Kabul. Last month, the Taliban

03:51.264 --> 03:57.137
captured and held Kunduz in the
north for three days. Also
today, NATO announced two

03:57.137 --> 04:03.376
U.S. and two British soldiers
died in a helicopter crash
Sunday in Kabul.

04:03.376 --> 04:09.382
Government troops in Western
Syria made fresh advances today
with the help of Russian air

04:09.382 --> 04:14.788
support. The ground offensive
aims to regain a stronghold of
President Bashar Assad's.

04:14.788 --> 04:19.126
It's a village that would give
them access to a main highway.
Meanwhile, Russian jets

04:19.126 --> 04:22.896
again hit targets
across Central Syria.

04:22.896 --> 04:27.634
But, as the air war intensified,
President Vladimir Putin claimed
Russia's role is strictly

04:27.634 --> 04:29.636
limited.

04:29.636 --> 04:35.075
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
By no means do we want to get

04:35.075 --> 04:40.080
involved in any inter-religious
conflicts in Syria. We have only
one goal, which is

04:40.080 --> 04:44.951
to support the lawful
authorities and to create
conditions for political
settlement. This

04:44.951 --> 04:47.487
is what we have based our
actions on from the very
beginning. And this is what we
are

04:47.487 --> 04:49.856
guided by now.

04:49.856 --> 04:54.394
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. military
answered Russia's air campaign
today by airdropping

04:54.394 --> 04:59.733
ammunition and other supplies
to rebels in Northern Syria.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.904
This was another day of
bloodshed and death in and
around Jerusalem, with a spate
of new

05:03.904 --> 05:09.643
stabbings. Within a few hours,
two Israeli policemen and two
civilians were attacked

05:09.643 --> 05:14.648
in separate incidents. Two
teenagers were shot dead by
police. Israeli Prime Minister

05:14.648 --> 05:21.188
Benjamin Netanyahu accused
Israeli Arab leaders of helping
incite the violence.

05:21.188 --> 05:28.261
In economic news, computer giant
Dell is buying data storage
company EMC in the tech
industry's

05:28.261 --> 05:35.502
largest takeover ever. The deal
is valued at about $67 billion.
It will help move Dell's

05:35.502 --> 05:40.207
focus away from traditional
hardware, like personal
computers, to storage and
business

05:40.207 --> 05:42.776
services.

05:42.776 --> 05:48.515
Wall made a modest advance
today, as investors waited for
third-quarter profit reports.
The

05:48.515 --> 05:54.521
Dow Jones industrial average
gained 47 points to close above
17130. The Nasdaq rose eight

05:54.521 --> 05:59.025
points, and the S&P
500 added two.

05:59.025 --> 06:04.664
And nine former American
prisoners of war have returned
to Japan, seven decades after

06:04.664 --> 06:10.337
the end of World War II. The
veterans, all in their '90s now,
traveled with their families

06:10.337 --> 06:17.611
today to Yokohama to honor
fellow servicemen who died in
captivity. More than 130,000
Allied

06:17.611 --> 06:24.718
troops were held prisoner by the
Japanese during the war. Almost
a third of them perished.

06:24.718 --> 06:30.156
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next for Washington Post
reporter Jason Rezaian,

06:30.156 --> 06:37.664
found guilty by an Iranian
court; Syrian refugees in Jordan
desperate to find their next
move,

06:37.664 --> 06:56.850
some even going back to Syria;
school discipline. Is there an
age too young to be suspended?

06:56.850 --> 07:00.487
President Obama faced one of the
toughest lines of questioning
since taking office in

07:00.487 --> 07:05.091
an interview with Steve Kroft
on "60 Minutes" last night.

07:05.091 --> 07:09.462
When asked about Hillary
Clinton's use of a private
e-mail server while serving as
secretary

07:09.462 --> 07:13.066
of state, the president said the
controversy was politically
motivated.

07:13.066 --> 07:11.965
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I don't think it
posed a national security

07:11.965 --> 07:13.566
problem.

07:13.566 --> 07:13.633
I think that it was a mistake
that she has acknowledged. As a
general proposition, when

07:13.633 --> 07:13.833
we're in these offices, we have
to be more sensitive and stay as
far away from the line

07:13.833 --> 07:12.532
as possible when it comes to how
we handle information, how we
handle our own personal

07:12.532 --> 07:14.067
data.

07:14.067 --> 07:14.567
I do think that the way it's
been ginned up is in part
because of politics. And I think

07:14.567 --> 07:13.800
she'd be the first to
acknowledge that maybe she could
have handled the original
decision

07:13.800 --> 07:14.901
better and the disclosures
more quickly.

07:14.901 --> 07:18.505
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also this
weekend, a former staffer for
the special committee
investigating

07:18.505 --> 07:24.411
the Benghazi consulate attack
spoke out on CNN, claiming the
Republican-led panel was

07:24.411 --> 07:27.981
targeting Clinton, rather than
conducting an objective
investigation.

07:27.981 --> 07:27.914
BRADLEY PODLISKA, Fired Benghazi
Committee Staffer: Hillary
Clinton has a lot of explaining

07:27.914 --> 07:27.981
to do. We, however, did not need
to shift resources to
hyper-focus on Hillary Clinton.

07:27.981 --> 07:28.281
We didn't need to de-emphasize
and in some cases drop the
investigation on different

07:28.281 --> 07:29.616
agencies, different
organizations and different
individuals.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.285
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and a
look ahead to the first
Democratic presidential debate
on

07:32.285 --> 07:36.056
Tuesday. It's a perfect
time for Politics Monday.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.459
I'm joined by Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.427
Welcome to you both.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.027
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Thank you.

07:41.027 --> 07:41.161
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Thanks.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.496
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
lot to talk about.

07:43.496 --> 07:48.568
So, the president, as we just
heard, he has weighed in now,
said Hillary Clinton made

07:48.568 --> 07:52.839
a mistake, but he said she has
acknowledged it. And we just
heard this former staffer,

07:52.839 --> 07:56.543
Tamara, for the Benghazi
Committee said that what they
were doing was politically
motivated,

07:56.543 --> 08:00.313
it was too targeted on her.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.882
Is this going to make a
difference, do you think, in
this issue? Is it going to go
away

08:02.882 --> 08:04.751
as a result of this?

08:04.751 --> 08:07.887
TAMARA KEITH: This is
absolutely not going away.

08:07.887 --> 08:11.925
The Benghazi Committee is going
to have a hearing -- it has it
scheduled for about a

08:11.925 --> 08:16.796
week from now, a little more
than a week from now, where
Hillary Clinton is set to
testify.

08:16.796 --> 08:22.068
She will have more fuel to be
able to say, look, this a
partisan thing. But they're
going

08:22.068 --> 08:24.871
to ask her tough questions and
she's going to sit there and
have to answer them for what

08:24.871 --> 08:28.108
could be a very,
very long hearing.

08:28.108 --> 08:35.014
And then the e-mails are going
to keep coming out in monthly
doses. So, just because she

08:35.014 --> 08:38.218
had a couple of decent news
cycles doesn't mean that this
goes away. It is also very

08:38.218 --> 08:40.987
muddy in people's
minds at this point.

08:40.987 --> 08:44.491
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, even
with the McCarthy, the Kevin
McCarthy statement, politically

08:44.491 --> 08:46.426
motivated, and this former
staffer, you're saying it
doesn't make any difference, or

08:46.426 --> 08:47.327
does it?

08:47.327 --> 08:49.796
AMY WALTER: Yes, I
agree with Tamara.

08:49.796 --> 08:54.134
You still have the FBI
investigating. Was there
classified material on here that
she

08:54.134 --> 08:59.806
willingly passed on? Was she
hacked by -- her e-mail server
hacked by a foreign government?

08:59.806 --> 09:01.408
We still need answers to those
questions, plus the drip, drip,
drip of e-mails coming

09:01.408 --> 09:03.443
out.

09:03.443 --> 09:07.080
I think the one thing it
provides Hillary Clinton -- and
we may see this tomorrow at

09:07.080 --> 09:12.285
the debate -- is an opportunity
to rally Democrats behind her,
where she is able to say, see,

09:12.285 --> 09:17.957
Democrats, I know you have been
a little bit, maybe a little bit
questioning about me, maybe

09:17.957 --> 09:22.162
not as enthusiastic as you
should be. But guess what? The
reason Republicans are doing

09:22.162 --> 09:25.999
this is they don't want me to be
president. They don't want me to
talk about these issues.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.635
They don't want us to bring up
-- they know they can't beat me,
so they bring this issue

09:28.635 --> 09:31.805
up in order to try to defeat me.

09:31.805 --> 09:36.409
TAMARA KEITH: And I will say
that when I interview Democrats
about this, and I did at least a

09:36.409 --> 09:41.114
dozen, probably maybe 20
man-on-the-street interviews
just last week, all of the
Democrats

09:41.114 --> 09:44.217
I talked to said it
doesn't bother me.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.985
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huh. So the
rallying affect that Amy is
talking about, you are saying

09:45.985 --> 09:47.187
is already out there.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.022
(CROSSTALK)

09:49.022 --> 09:51.758
TAMARA KEITH: They are convinced
this is part of the vast
right-wing conspiracy that
Hillary

09:51.758 --> 09:53.693
Clinton coined.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.096
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
Democratic debate, as you said,
Amy, is tomorrow night, first

09:57.096 --> 09:59.299
time we're going to see
them all together.

09:59.299 --> 10:03.136
And meantime, there are some new
polls out. And we can show you
the results of this. Going

10:03.136 --> 10:08.174
in, it has Hillary Clinton up in
some of the primary states. This
is Nevada, where the

10:08.174 --> 10:14.581
debate is going to be held,
coincidentally. You see Clinton
up 50 to 34 over Bernie Sanders.

10:14.581 --> 10:20.520
In South Carolina, she's also up
49 to 24, with an even bigger
margin. Then, nationally

10:20.520 --> 10:27.894
-- those are CNN polls. Then we
have a CBS poll nationally
showing her up 46 to 27.

10:27.894 --> 10:33.633
Tamara, you know, looking at
this, does this give her such a
big advantage that, what,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.002
she becomes a target
tomorrow night?

10:36.002 --> 10:38.872
TAMARA KEITH: Did you think she
wasn't going to be the target
all along?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.407
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.
So what changes here?

10:41.407 --> 10:46.679
TAMARA KEITH: Well, the polls
obviously don't change anything
here.

10:46.679 --> 10:52.485
Those states are more diverse
than the states where Bernie
Sanders is now winning or right

10:52.485 --> 10:56.923
on her heels, New Hampshire and
Iowa. But those are the two
first states and so they

10:56.923 --> 10:58.925
have sort of an outsized
influence on things.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.928
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy,
what do you see?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.631
AMY WALTER: About the debate
tomorrow night, she definitely
is going to be the person that

11:04.631 --> 11:07.367
everybody is focusing on.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.971
And the question is how
aggressive are her opponents in
making that case? Is Bernie
Sanders,

11:11.971 --> 11:16.776
as he said this weekend on "Meet
the Press," going to show the
consistency with which he's

11:16.776 --> 11:21.047
stood by his convictions, a
not-so-veiled reference to the
fact that Hillary Clinton

11:21.047 --> 11:26.085
has taken multiple positions on
the issues over the course of
her career, that she most

11:26.085 --> 11:30.557
recently came out against the
Keystone pipeline, against the
trade promotion pact, Pacific

11:30.557 --> 11:33.026
pact?

11:33.026 --> 11:36.763
You know, is he going to be that
aggressive? Is Martin O'Malley
going to be that aggressive?

11:36.763 --> 11:39.532
Or are they going to sit back a
little bit and try to make the
case for themselves, but

11:39.532 --> 11:41.901
not make it about her?

11:41.901 --> 11:45.838
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do they have
to do tomorrow night? I mean, do
they -- don't they -- somebody

11:45.838 --> 11:49.642
like Martin O'Malley is barely
registering in these polls.
Tamara, what does he need

11:49.642 --> 11:51.444
to do?

11:51.444 --> 11:56.349
TAMARA KEITH: In many polls,
he's an asterisk or a hyphen. He
doesn't even have 1 percent.

11:56.349 --> 12:00.954
And what he needs to do, just by
being on that stage, he will do
a lot of that. People

12:00.954 --> 12:04.824
will figure out who Martin
O'Malley is. They will learn his
name. But he also needs to

12:04.824 --> 12:10.797
be impressive. He needs to say
something that gets people
excited.

12:10.797 --> 12:15.835
And what he has been saying and
it seems likely he will continue
to say is, hey, look, I'm

12:15.835 --> 12:20.640
a new generation, wink, wink,
I'm younger than those other
people, and he also talks

12:20.640 --> 12:24.210
a lot about his executive
experience. I would expect him
to do that again.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.580
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there that
much difference on the issues,
Amy, among these candidates?

12:27.580 --> 12:32.051
AMY WALTER: Not so much now that
Hillary has come out decisively
on two big issues, trade

12:32.051 --> 12:33.119
and the Keystone pipeline.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.487
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moving left.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.956
AMY WALTER: Moving
left on those issues.

12:36.956 --> 12:40.493
I don't think you are going to
see that much difference,
although you may see somebody

12:40.493 --> 12:45.064
come up and talk about her vote
on Iraq, which, of course, now
she has said was a mistake.

12:45.064 --> 12:49.002
I do think it's stylistic. And
the difference between this
debate and the Republican debate

12:49.002 --> 12:53.973
is, the Republican debate -- the
Republican primary is truly wide
open. So there was an

12:53.973 --> 12:58.544
opportunity for somebody like a
Marco Rubio, a Carly Fiorina to
rise up, because you have

12:58.544 --> 13:03.750
Republicans truly searching
around for anybody, trying to
figure out who these people are.

13:03.750 --> 13:10.123
On the Democratic side, she is
the front-runner. She has very
high approval ratings among
Democrats.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.560
Democrats do not look like they
are looking for somebody else.
So, if you are Martin O'Malley,

13:14.560 --> 13:18.064
if you are Bernie Sanders, you
have got to give them, them
meaning the voters, a reason

13:18.064 --> 13:19.465
to look away from
Hillary Clinton.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.034
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.237
I can't get let the two of you
get away without asking about
what is going on in the House

13:24.237 --> 13:26.606
of Representatives. They can't
seem to agree on who their
speaker is going to be, that

13:26.606 --> 13:28.307
is, the Republican Caucus.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.077
Tamara, what is your
reporting telling you?

13:31.077 --> 13:35.915
TAMARA KEITH: I checked in with
a spokesman for Paul Ryan, who
is the chairman of the

13:35.915 --> 13:38.985
House Ways and Means Committee,
of course, former vice
presidential nominee. He is the

13:38.985 --> 13:41.587
one who it seems like everyone
wants. The spokesman said, check
my Twitter.

13:41.587 --> 13:42.488
And on Twitter...

13:42.488 --> 13:44.290
JUDY WOODRUFF:
That's a new answer.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.893
TAMARA KEITH: Well, here you go.

13:46.893 --> 13:50.263
And on Twitter, he said, before
you even ask, I have no updates,
and I don't expect any

13:50.263 --> 13:53.199
updates for the whole week.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.402
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, when --
could this begin to have
longer-term effects on the
Republicans

13:56.402 --> 13:56.969
or...

13:56.969 --> 13:59.439
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

13:59.439 --> 14:04.811
The person actually who is most
in danger of this being a
problem is actually Mitch

14:04.811 --> 14:08.915
McConnell, who is the majority
leader in the Senate, the
Republican leader of the Senate.

14:08.915 --> 14:13.286
The House, despite all this
dysfunction, is likely to stay
in Republican hands. There

14:13.286 --> 14:19.592
are just too many
Republican-controlled seats that
are too safe. The problem for
Republicans

14:19.592 --> 14:25.098
is in the Senate, where they
have at least seven seats in
states that Barack Obama
carried.

14:25.098 --> 14:29.635
These are very marginal states,
where the Republican incumbent
is trying desperately

14:29.635 --> 14:32.572
to not look too partisan.

14:32.572 --> 14:38.211
If we see Washington truly melt
down, Republicans get the blame,
it's those senators who are

14:38.211 --> 14:42.982
going to take a lot of the
suffering, not the House folks.
And that is the danger, I

14:42.982 --> 14:45.284
think, really for Republicans.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.619
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating,
because so many people are
focused right now just on the
House.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.120
AMY WALTER: Right.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.855
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

14:48.855 --> 14:53.092
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, we thank you both,
Politics Monday.

14:53.092 --> 14:57.363
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

14:57.363 --> 15:03.102
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

15:03.102 --> 15:11.477
JUDY WOODRUFF: Washington Post
reporter Jason Rezaian is
spending his 447th night in a
jail

15:11.477 --> 15:16.682
in Iran tonight. News that an
Iranian court convicted the
journalist came yesterday, but

15:16.682 --> 15:19.819
little else is known about
the ruling or his fate.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.288
Jeffrey Brown has more.

15:22.288 --> 15:26.325
JEFFREY BROWN: Iran's judiciary
announced that an appeal could
be filed, but gave no

15:26.325 --> 15:32.131
specifics on the details of the
ruling. Rezaian was tried on
espionage and other charges.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.001
We reached out to Iran's
representative at the United
Nations to join us. He didn't
accept

15:35.001 --> 15:37.603
our invitation.

15:37.603 --> 15:42.041
For its part, The Washington
Post is calling the ruling --
quote -- "an outrageous
injustice."

15:42.041 --> 15:44.944
And joining me now is the
newspaper's foreign editor,
Douglas Jehl.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.146
Doug Jehl, thanks
for joining us.

15:47.146 --> 15:51.517
Do we even know at this point
what Jason Rezaian has been
convicted of or what sentence he

15:51.517 --> 15:53.186
might face?

15:53.186 --> 15:56.355
DOUGLAS JEHL, Foreign Editor,
The Washington Post: We know
none of that.

15:56.355 --> 16:03.563
We know only that he has been
convicted, but on what charges,
what penalty, and indeed,

16:03.563 --> 16:09.268
what basis Iran claims to offer
for convicting Jason of these
crimes, it has never been
stated.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.738
JEFFREY BROWN: And is there any
way of knowing whether he
himself has -- whether he knows

16:12.738 --> 16:15.708
any of this or knows
the situation?

16:15.708 --> 16:21.480
DOUGLAS JEHL: Well, his mother,
his wife and his attorney went
to the court today in Tehran,

16:21.480 --> 16:27.453
to the Revolutionary Court, to
seek clarity. And, cruelly, they
were turned away. They

16:27.453 --> 16:31.257
were told that the translator
wasn't available, that they
could be given no further
information

16:31.257 --> 16:33.226
at this time.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.229
Our presumption is that
Jason doesn't know.

16:36.229 --> 16:41.667
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, even though
this is playing out in the
court, your supposition all
along

16:41.667 --> 16:45.538
has been that this is really,
really playing out in the
political sphere, correct?
Explain

16:45.538 --> 16:47.173
what you think is going on.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.409
DOUGLAS JEHL: I
think that's right.

16:50.409 --> 16:56.382
I think this has played out
very, very slowly in the Iranian
courts for 15 months now, but

16:56.382 --> 17:01.621
it's clear that ultimately the
decision-makers are going to be
Iran's senior leadership.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.491
It's the senior leaders who have
the power to overturn a decision
in court. They have

17:05.491 --> 17:09.095
the power to pardon
someone like Jason.

17:09.095 --> 17:13.165
They have the power to bring him
home. And in recent weeks, we
have seen very strong

17:13.165 --> 17:18.604
signals from Iran's president,
Rouhani, and others of what they
want. They have made clear

17:18.604 --> 17:22.742
they're willing to move toward
freeing Jason and other
Americans if the United States
is

17:22.742 --> 17:26.145
willing to free Iranians held
in American prisons in return.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.081
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so what
has kept that from happening?

17:29.081 --> 17:34.954
DOUGLAS JEHL: The United States
hasn't really responded to those
overtures from Iran, at

17:34.954 --> 17:38.124
least not in public. We don't
know if there has been further
discussion behind closed

17:38.124 --> 17:40.693
doors.

17:40.693 --> 17:44.897
One thing that has prevented it
from happening, though, is that,
until now, the matter has

17:44.897 --> 17:51.370
remained in the courts. If there
is any glimmer of hope from
today's announcement, as
outrageous

17:51.370 --> 17:56.676
and cruel as it was, it may be
that this sham of a judicial
process is nearing its end and

17:56.676 --> 18:00.713
that the political steps
are about to begin.

18:00.713 --> 18:06.619
JEFFREY BROWN: What about
tensions in Iran, in which
hard-liners, conservatives are
perhaps

18:06.619 --> 18:11.724
sending a message to Rouhani and
so-called moderates to -- in the
context, of course,

18:11.724 --> 18:15.294
of the recent nuclear
deal and other things?

18:15.294 --> 18:19.665
DOUGLAS JEHL: I think it is
clear that Jason Rezaian, an
innocent journalist, has been

18:19.665 --> 18:24.437
caught up in a much, much
larger struggle inside Iran.

18:24.437 --> 18:29.976
And I think it's also clear that
President Rouhani has limited
authority for what happens

18:29.976 --> 18:34.847
inside Iran. I think he has made
clear he would like to have seen
Jason released a long

18:34.847 --> 18:40.119
time ago. The fact that that
hasn't happened suggests that it
is other forces, the security

18:40.119 --> 18:45.291
services in particular, who
have at least equal power here.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.461
JEFFREY BROWN: You at this point
do not know anything about a
potential prisoner swap?

18:48.461 --> 18:52.531
DOUGLAS JEHL: We
do not. I do not.

18:52.531 --> 18:57.670
All I know is that -- is what we
have heard publicly from Iranian
officials for weeks

18:57.670 --> 19:05.277
now, referring to as many as 19
Iranians held in American jails,
and suggesting that, while

19:05.277 --> 19:09.615
they say they don't like the
word exchange, that there could
be a progress toward the

19:09.615 --> 19:14.220
release of Americans if there is
progress toward the release of
Iranians held here.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.788
JEFFREY BROWN: Douglas Jehl of
The Washington Post, thank you
so much.

19:15.788 --> 19:20.926
DOUGLAS JEHL: Thank you.

19:20.926 --> 19:31.470
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:31.470 --> 19:37.309
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Angus Deaton; some schools under

19:37.309 --> 19:43.082
fire for suspending very young
students; and an NBA player
returns to his native Congo

19:43.082 --> 19:48.354
to help provide opportunities
to former child soldiers.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.658
But first, we take a closer look
at what's driving many Syrian
refugees to risk their

19:52.658 --> 19:57.029
lives by attempting the
journey to Europe.

19:57.029 --> 20:03.402
Syria's neighbor, Jordan, has
taken in more than 600,000
refugees over the past four
years,

20:03.402 --> 20:08.607
and has quite literally been
buckling under the strain on its
scarce resources and a massive

20:08.607 --> 20:13.979
drop in international aid. The
refugees themselves are the
hardest-hit there.

20:13.979 --> 20:18.150
And, tonight, special
correspondent Jane Arraf
introduces us to a few of them
who are willing

20:18.150 --> 20:21.787
to risk everything to leave.

20:21.787 --> 20:28.561
JANE ARRAF: Every evening, Ali
goes out with his daughters and
his son, Hassan. It's not

20:28.561 --> 20:34.800
for the fresh air. It's illegal
for most Syrian refugees to work
in Jordan. In the daytime,

20:34.800 --> 20:41.941
he tries to find odd jobs
without getting arrested. To
help put food on the table, at

20:41.941 --> 20:47.246
night, he looks for soda cans to
sell and broken appliances to
repair.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.851
ALI, Syrian Refugee (through
translator): Sometimes, I take
the girls with me and walk

20:51.851 --> 20:55.821
for three or four miles. At the
end of the month, people get
their salaries and throw

20:55.821 --> 20:59.525
a lot of things away. But when I
walk for longer distances, I
just take Hassan, and

20:59.525 --> 21:02.561
I carry two or three
bags with me.

21:02.561 --> 21:09.235
JANE ARRAF: It's exhausting, but
he says he would rather do
honest work than beg for money.

21:09.235 --> 21:16.041
Hassan is 13. He was in a car
accident in Syria when he was a
baby. He and five sisters

21:16.041 --> 21:20.813
and a brother came to Jordan
with their parents three years
ago. Two more children were born

21:20.813 --> 21:25.518
here, a blessing, Ali says.

21:25.518 --> 21:30.623
He says when they first came
from Aleppo, things were fine.
They brought almost $20,000

21:30.623 --> 21:36.629
in savings. And organizations
were eager to help. But now the
savings are gone. And aid

21:36.629 --> 21:41.133
has been cut to almost nothing.
With winter coming, it's become
almost impossible here.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.670
But Ali has a plan.

21:44.670 --> 21:50.376
ALI (through translator): My
wife's family is in Turkey. Her
relatives went to Germany.

21:50.376 --> 21:54.713
Some of them arrived. Some of
them didn't. We spoke to some
people, and, God willing,

21:54.713 --> 21:58.417
by the end of the month, we will
be there. We will leave from
here to Turkey with our

21:58.417 --> 22:03.656
passports and then we will leave
Turkey for Greece and then
Austria and then Germany.

22:03.656 --> 22:08.994
JANE ARRAF: Ali's nephew drowned
this year trying to reach
Europe. He says the children

22:08.994 --> 22:13.132
are all terrified of dying on
the crossing. But he plans to
get a backpack and carry the

22:13.132 --> 22:19.038
youngest children on his back.
His wife will carry Hassan.

22:19.038 --> 22:24.410
Ali's family is among the 80
percent of Syrian refugees
trying to survive outside the
camps

22:24.410 --> 22:31.584
in Jordan. It's a small country
with high unemployment and few
resources sandwiched

22:31.584 --> 22:41.527
between Syria, Iraq, Israel, the
Palestinian territories, and
Saudi Arabia.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.531
Politicians like Mustafa
Hamarneh say it would make sense
to allow Syrians to work legally

22:45.531 --> 22:48.934
in Jordan, but that's
unlikely to happen.

22:48.934 --> 22:52.538
MUSTAFA HAMARNEH, Member of
Jordanian Parliament: You have
to keep in mind that over 20
percent

22:52.538 --> 22:59.545
of the -- of Jordan's population
today is -- consists of Syrian
refugees. On top of

22:59.545 --> 23:03.282
that, you have 400,000
Egyptians. On top of that, you
have about 300,000 Iraqis, and
you

23:03.282 --> 23:06.318
have 50,000 Yemenis.

23:06.318 --> 23:12.725
And now Interior tells us that
there are about 100,000 Libyans.
So, how do you deal with

23:12.725 --> 23:16.762
all this and how do you deal
with the tremendous unrest
around us?

23:16.762 --> 23:21.367
JANE ARRAF: There's an intense
sympathy here for the refugees,
but as the war goes on,

23:21.367 --> 23:24.103
a growing frustration.

23:24.103 --> 23:28.774
MUSTAFA HAMARNEH: Now, you will
not see in Jordan what you see
in Europe, massive
demonstrations

23:28.774 --> 23:34.680
against the refugees. You see
some voices here, that these are
our skinheads who make

23:34.680 --> 23:39.852
noise here and there, but there
will not be any mass -- negative
mass movement opposing

23:39.852 --> 23:43.188
either the Syrians
or the Iraqis.

23:43.188 --> 23:46.225
Once the dust settles down at
the end of the day these are
Arabs and people see them as

23:46.225 --> 23:48.427
fellow Arabs.

23:48.427 --> 23:53.499
JANE ARRAF: But particularly in
the cities, a lot of Jordanian
citizens feel they are

23:53.499 --> 24:02.474
competing with Syrian refugees
for basic resources. This is one
of Jordan's biggest supermarket

24:02.474 --> 24:06.612
chains. It's one of 90
supermarkets where Syrian
refugees can access the aid
provided

24:06.612 --> 24:10.816
by the World Food Program.

24:10.816 --> 24:16.622
With the latest cuts, it's full
of food that refugees now can
only dream of being able

24:16.622 --> 24:24.463
to afford. Only the poorest of
Syrian refugees are stilling
getting help buying food. So,

24:24.463 --> 24:30.002
with cards like these from the
World Food Program, each of them
gets $14 a month. That

24:30.002 --> 24:36.508
doesn't go very far. For
instance, this bottle of oil
costs $4.

24:36.508 --> 24:41.847
Just a bag of sugar would cost
almost half a refugee's monthly
allowance. The cuts in

24:41.847 --> 24:46.051
aid have been so deep that, on
this day, all of these shoppers
are Jordanian. Jordanian

24:46.051 --> 24:51.857
businesspeople say rents have
risen so much since the Syrians
arrived that even Jordanians

24:51.857 --> 24:55.694
have less money
to spend on food.

24:55.694 --> 25:01.967
The World Food Program cut aid
in half to a quarter-million
Syrians here. More than

25:01.967 --> 25:08.407
100,000 people, including
children, were dropped entirely.
Refugees are increasingly making

25:08.407 --> 25:13.011
the dangerous journey to Europe
because they're having trouble
surviving in neighboring
countries.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.849
JONATHAN CAMPBELL, World Food
Program: The cuts in assistance
is one of the driving factors.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.686
I don't think we are the only
organization, but we were
described the other day as the

25:20.686 --> 25:26.325
straw that broke the camel's
back, and I think that's
probably true.

25:26.325 --> 25:34.099
JANE ARRAF: After four years of
fighting in Syria, half the
country's population is
displaced.

25:34.099 --> 25:40.005
And Jordan's biggest camp,
Zaatari, is looking more
permanent. The tents are still
here,

25:40.005 --> 25:44.410
but now they are attached to
trailers provided for each
family. Some refugees have
started

25:44.410 --> 25:51.784
growing their old food,
like corn and eggplant.

25:51.784 --> 25:56.889
The population at Zaatari camp
has been capped at 80,000
people, and the cuts in aid here

25:56.889 --> 26:03.862
are far less severe. It's
sweltering in the summer and
cold in the winter, but no one

26:03.862 --> 26:11.069
is in danger of starving. From
this camp, though, more than 100
refugees a day are actually

26:11.069 --> 26:18.510
leaving back to Syria. They're
not allowed to return to Jordan.

26:18.510 --> 26:25.284
Relatives load the bus with
blankets and clothing they will
need to survive in devastated
communities.

26:25.284 --> 26:33.826
Um Mohammad is trying to take
one last photo of her grandson
before a policeman stops her.

26:33.826 --> 26:38.130
Many of those on the bus don't
want it known they're going
back.

26:38.130 --> 26:42.000
Her son was arrested for working
illegally and has already gone
back to Syria.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.505
UM MOHAMMAD, Syrian Refugee
(through translator): He called
his wife and said, we are going

26:46.505 --> 26:49.708
to Turkey. Come and join me. In
Turkey, life is much better than
here. We are allowed to

26:49.708 --> 26:51.743
work.

26:51.743 --> 26:56.515
JANE ARRAF: Jordan has
essentially closed its border
with Syria. There are now more

26:56.515 --> 27:03.155
Syrian refugees leaving Jordan
than arriving. Most of the
refugees going back to Syria
won't

27:03.155 --> 27:08.293
talk on camera. Some say they're
being sent back by the Jordanian
government after being

27:08.293 --> 27:13.232
caught working illegally.
Some are going back to fight.

27:13.232 --> 27:19.171
But most of them say, with the
cuts in aid, they just can't
survive in Jordan anymore.

27:19.171 --> 27:26.211
The Jordanian government says it
has in the past deported a small
number of refugees back

27:26.211 --> 27:30.449
to Syria for serious security
violations. But it says all of
those going back now are

27:30.449 --> 27:34.086
returning voluntarily.

27:34.086 --> 27:42.661
Ali isn't thinking of going back
to Syria. He's got his sights
set on Sweden. He can

27:42.661 --> 27:48.567
fix almost anything. Almost
everything in their home,
including the television, was

27:48.567 --> 27:53.739
either thrown away or bought
cheaply and repaired. He says he
doesn't want any handouts in
Europe.

27:53.739 --> 27:59.044
He will clean bathrooms
if he has to.

27:59.044 --> 28:03.215
He knows there's a chance they
could die trying to get there.
But here, he says, is the
certainty

28:03.215 --> 28:05.651
of another difficult winter.

28:05.651 --> 28:15.661
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jane Arraf in Amman, Jordan.

28:15.661 --> 28:29.641
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, the winner
of the Nobel Prize in Economics.

28:29.641 --> 28:35.180
Scottish-born Angus Deaton was
recognized earlier today for his
analyses about spending,

28:35.180 --> 28:41.687
poverty and welfare. His work is
based on economic models with a
focus on individuals

28:41.687 --> 28:46.592
and on household surveys that
reveal how different social
groups make economic decisions,
particularly

28:46.592 --> 28:49.328
in poorer countries.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.698
I spoke to him a short while ago
at Princeton where he is a
professor at the Woodrow Wilson

28:52.698 --> 28:54.733
School.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
Professor Deaton, thank you
very much. And congratulations.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.306
ANGUS DEATON, Nobel Prize in
Economics Winner: Thank you.
It's a pleasure to talk to you.

29:01.306 --> 29:04.009
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you thought it
might have been a prank call?

29:04.009 --> 29:07.279
ANGUS DEATON: Well, I didn't
think it was a prank call until
they said it's not a prank

29:07.279 --> 29:07.746
call.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.815
(LAUGHTER)

29:09.815 --> 29:12.484
ANGUS DEATON: I hadn't really
thought of it until that moment.
But then I thought, maybe

29:12.484 --> 29:15.721
it was a prank call.

29:15.721 --> 29:21.159
But I recognized two of the
people on the committee, so I'm
sure that was a joke. And

29:21.159 --> 29:24.730
it certainly made us all smile,
even early in the morning.

29:24.730 --> 29:31.737
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were honored
for your measurement of basic
economic indicators. For people
who

29:31.737 --> 29:37.075
don't know economics, explain
why measuring things matters.

29:37.075 --> 29:41.380
ANGUS DEATON: Well, I mean, I
think we tend to take a lot of
things for granted.

29:41.380 --> 29:47.185
I mean, you know, the very word
data means given. And yet most
of the numbers we have

29:47.185 --> 29:51.957
are not given. They're produced
by statistical offices, many of
whom are under terrible budget

29:51.957 --> 29:54.793
pressure and threats from
politicians who don't understand
how important the numbers

29:54.793 --> 29:57.129
are.

29:57.129 --> 30:02.367
And, also, we can't -- if we
don't know what sort of progress
we're making and how we're

30:02.367 --> 30:06.238
doing, we don't really know
where we are. And, you know, a
lot of people think the world

30:06.238 --> 30:09.107
is getting to be a worse place.
A lot are thinking it is getting
to be a better place.

30:09.107 --> 30:13.512
We have got to be able to
resolve these questions and know
what is happening.

30:13.512 --> 30:17.816
We talk about inequality a lot.
Well, we have got to measure it
and we have got to be able

30:17.816 --> 30:20.452
to say whether those people who
say it is getting worse are
right or those people who

30:20.452 --> 30:23.955
say nothing is
happening are right.

30:23.955 --> 30:28.393
And so measurement is a very,
very important part of this, and
careful measurement is something

30:28.393 --> 30:31.830
that's not always
in great supply.

30:31.830 --> 30:37.469
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, give us an
example of how you improved one
kind of measurement.

30:37.469 --> 30:41.840
ANGUS DEATON: Well, for
instance, one of the things that
we're interested in is whether

30:41.840 --> 30:45.944
-- how much money people have
and how much stuff they can buy
given the amount of money

30:45.944 --> 30:48.447
they actually have.

30:48.447 --> 30:53.185
So, one of the things to do that
is, you need to know what prices
are like where they are.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.456
So you have to measure very
carefully the prices of all the
goods they buy. So, you

30:57.456 --> 31:02.427
know, if your rent goes up, even
if you have the same income, you
are poorer. And so that's

31:02.427 --> 31:05.864
been a real challenge,
especially in global poverty,
but also in measuring individual

31:05.864 --> 31:07.999
country poverty.

31:07.999 --> 31:13.004
So I have done a lot of work on
trying to measure prices in
India, for instance, and

31:13.004 --> 31:15.741
trying to match up those prices
to individual people and to find
out how well those people

31:15.741 --> 31:17.609
are doing.

31:17.609 --> 31:22.114
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did a
professor at Princeton
University, which most people
consider to

31:22.114 --> 31:26.718
be a pretty elite place, get so
interested in inequality and in
poverty and worry -- and

31:26.718 --> 31:29.454
be worried about it?

31:29.454 --> 31:33.658
ANGUS DEATON: Well, maybe --
someone asked me this today, and
I think it's true -- that

31:33.658 --> 31:37.863
I grew up pretty poor.

31:37.863 --> 31:43.034
I have had experience -- you
know, I probably belonged to the
1 percent nowadays. I have

31:43.034 --> 31:48.940
an experience at both ends of
the distribution. And that's
taught me a lot. And I think, if

31:48.940 --> 31:55.147
you have never really been poor,
it's hard to understand how --
what most of the people

31:55.147 --> 32:00.252
in the world live through and
live like, and how lucky those
of us are who don't have to

32:00.252 --> 32:02.954
live these really,
really difficult lives.

32:02.954 --> 32:07.259
Luck is an incredibly important
thing. A lot of people who have
done very well think it

32:07.259 --> 32:10.162
was entirely by their own
efforts. Well, maybe it was.
But, for most of us, we got to
where

32:10.162 --> 32:13.231
we got by a lot of luck.

32:13.231 --> 32:18.336
So, I have always been very
conscience of that. And
Princeton has a public policy
school

32:18.336 --> 32:23.008
and it really cares about these
issues. So, I don't think there
is any contradiction there.

32:23.008 --> 32:27.646
You don't want to think of
Princeton as just a bunch of
elite kids doing whatever elite

32:27.646 --> 32:30.248
kids do.

32:30.248 --> 32:35.120
JUDY WOODRUFF: You -- in your
book that you wrote -- I guess
it came out two years ago

32:35.120 --> 32:36.888
-- "Great Escape: Health,
Wealth, and the Origins of
Inequality."

32:36.888 --> 32:38.390
ANGUS DEATON: Yes.

32:38.390 --> 32:43.562
JUDY WOODRUFF: You did show how
life on this planet Earth has
just gotten a whole lot better

32:43.562 --> 32:50.001
for many, many people, better
than it was a century ago,
half-a-century ago.

32:50.001 --> 32:55.040
And yet you do emphasize
inequality and why that is a
problem, and why it's something

32:55.040 --> 32:57.142
people need to keep focused on.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.744
ANGUS DEATON: That's
exactly right.

32:59.744 --> 33:03.515
And one of the things that has
delighted me, and as I have
thought about inequality and

33:03.515 --> 33:08.687
worried about inequality all my
working life -- but it's not
something that has been very

33:08.687 --> 33:13.091
much talked about. On the left,
people denounced inequality. On
the right, people denounced

33:13.091 --> 33:16.528
people who worried
about inequality.

33:16.528 --> 33:21.299
And there's been very little
serious discussion until
recently. And I think inequality
has

33:21.299 --> 33:28.106
its good sides. It's part of the
reward for effort and part of
the reward for new innovations

33:28.106 --> 33:31.676
and all the things that are
propelling our lives forward.

33:31.676 --> 33:36.481
But it also can be a terrible
threat if the people who get
very rich try to deprive the

33:36.481 --> 33:41.119
rest of us of things that are
important to us, like democracy,
like public schools, like

33:41.119 --> 33:46.324
public health systems, and so
on. So I think inequality is a
very two-edged sword. I think

33:46.324 --> 33:50.462
it's very important that we have
an enormous public debate about
it, and if this prize

33:50.462 --> 33:54.599
helps towards having that
debate, I would be absolutely
delighted.

33:54.599 --> 33:58.570
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professor Angus
Deaton, the winner of the Nobel
Prize in Economics, we

33:58.570 --> 34:01.206
congratulate you. And thanks.

34:01.206 --> 34:07.946
ANGUS DEATON: Thank you very
much, indeed. It's been a real
pleasure.

34:07.946 --> 34:20.825
JUDY WOODRUFF: With more than
three million students suspended
from public schools each

34:20.825 --> 34:24.829
year, President Obama and the
federal Department of Education
want schools to find
alternatives

34:24.829 --> 34:27.699
to sending kids home.

34:27.699 --> 34:32.504
Studies show that students who
are suspended are more likely to
be held back a grade, to

34:32.504 --> 34:36.541
drop out of school, or end up in
trouble with the law. Most
suspended students are in high

34:36.541 --> 34:40.211
school or, less
often, middle school.

34:40.211 --> 34:45.250
But in some schools, children as
young as 5 or 6 are being
disciplined this way.

34:45.250 --> 34:49.521
"NewsHour" special correspondent
for education John Merrow looks
at high-profile charter

34:49.521 --> 34:52.557
schools network
in New York City.

34:52.557 --> 35:00.231
JOHN MERROW: If you have ever
been sent home from school, what
they call suspended, if

35:00.231 --> 35:06.438
that ever happened to you, raise
your hand. No hands at all.

35:06.438 --> 35:11.176
Do you use out-of-school
suspension for kindergartners
and first graders?

35:11.176 --> 35:13.712
MARIE CHAUVET-MONCHIK,
Principal, PS-138 Brooklyn: No,
I can't. I can't see it. I don't
see the

35:13.712 --> 35:16.348
benefit of it.

35:16.348 --> 35:23.588
When you send a child home, the
child is missing instruction.
So, I'm actually robbing the

35:23.588 --> 35:26.891
child of an education
if I suspend the child.

35:26.891 --> 35:36.067
JOHN MERROW: This is PS-138, a
public school in Brooklyn, New
York. It reports suspensions

35:36.067 --> 35:39.971
in kindergarten and first grade.
But at the public charter school
in the same building,

35:39.971 --> 35:42.240
things are different.

35:42.240 --> 35:51.082
WOMAN: So, here at Success
Academy, we do have a very
structured environment, and we

35:51.082 --> 35:59.824
do have very high academic an
behavioral expectations for our
scholars. And we do suspend
children.

35:59.824 --> 36:06.631
JOHN MERROW: Quite a few. Last
year, principal Monica Komery
issued 44 out-of-school
suspensions

36:06.631 --> 36:13.538
to her 203 kindergartners and
first graders. Her school is
part of Success Academies, the

36:13.538 --> 36:17.375
largest charter network in New
York City. Like all charter
schools, they're publicly

36:17.375 --> 36:21.513
funded, but privately run.

36:21.513 --> 36:27.318
The network's founder and CEO,
Eva Moskowitz, believes behavior
sets the stage for learning.

36:27.318 --> 36:31.056
EVA MOSKOWITZ, Founder and CEO,
Success Academy Charter Schools:
If you get it right in the

36:31.056 --> 36:36.795
early years, you actually have
to suspend far less when the
kids are older, because

36:36.795 --> 36:40.832
they understand what
is expected of them.

36:40.832 --> 36:45.904
JOHN MERROW: Moskowitz opened
her first Success Academy in
2006. Since then, the network
has

36:45.904 --> 36:51.876
grown to 34 schools, nearly all
of them elementary. They
emphasize science and the arts
and are

36:51.876 --> 36:56.848
wildly popular among parents,
with 10 applicants for every
seat.

36:56.848 --> 37:01.486
WOMAN: I was ecstatic when we
got into Success Academy. Grade
school, I tell all my friends

37:01.486 --> 37:03.955
and family, if you can, do it.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.357
JOHN MERROW: And what else
do they find appealing?

37:06.357 --> 37:11.896
WOMAN: For us, the learning, to
me, and the discipline as well.

37:11.896 --> 37:17.068
WOMAN: We do have a
zero-tolerance policy around
certain behaviors. But I don't
just

37:17.068 --> 37:20.338
suspend children as the first
course of action. It's
well-thought-out. It's a
process, and

37:20.338 --> 37:23.241
there are systems in place.

37:23.241 --> 37:29.380
JOHN MERROW: The code of conduct
runs six pages and identifies 65
infractions, from

37:29.380 --> 37:37.856
bullying and gambling to
littering and failing to be in a
ready-to-succeed position.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.559
Former Success Academy student
Jamir Geidi told me about some
of the other rules.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.762
JAMIR GEIDI, Former Success
Academy Student: I would always
have to keep my shirt tucked

37:44.762 --> 37:54.439
in. And let's say I wasn't
wearing black shoes, and I was
wearing red shoes. Then that
would

37:54.439 --> 37:56.808
be an infraction.

37:56.808 --> 38:01.946
JOHN MERROW: These infractions,
if repeated, could trigger an
out-of-school suspension,

38:01.946 --> 38:07.152
at the discretion of the
principal. By contrast,
principals at traditional public
schools have

38:07.152 --> 38:13.558
to have district approval before
suspending any
K-through-third-grade student.

38:13.558 --> 38:17.529
Suspension rates at Success
Academies are almost three times
higher than the city's

38:17.529 --> 38:23.835
K-12 public schools, even though
70 percent of Success Academies
are elementary schools.

38:23.835 --> 38:29.140
What does a 5-year-old do that
warrants an out-of-school
suspension of one day or
multiple

38:29.140 --> 38:31.042
days?

38:31.042 --> 38:34.612
EVA MOSKOWITZ: Well, using
sexually explicit language. It's
very upsetting.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.281
JOHN MERROW: First time?

38:36.281 --> 38:38.216
EVA MOSKOWITZ: First time, yes.

38:38.216 --> 38:43.855
JOHN MERROW: But your code of
conduct calls for out-of-school
suspension for a lot of

38:43.855 --> 38:48.693
other things, not just sexually
-- I mean, for example, calling
out the right answer

38:48.693 --> 38:51.262
twice without being called on.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.598
EVA MOSKOWITZ: That's not...

38:53.598 --> 38:58.503
JOHN MERROW: The first time you
do it is at level one
infraction. The second time is a

38:58.503 --> 39:02.674
level two. And one consequence
of level two is out-of-school
suspension. Or getting out

39:02.674 --> 39:04.042
of your seat without
permission...

39:04.042 --> 39:05.710
EVA MOSKOWITZ: Yes.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.580
JOHN MERROW: ... is a level two,
which could be out-of-school, or
even having...

39:08.580 --> 39:10.748
EVA MOSKOWITZ: But it --
it could be, but it's not.

39:10.748 --> 39:11.616
JOHN MERROW: I'm sorry?

39:11.616 --> 39:13.151
EVA MOSKOWITZ: We haven't.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.787
JOHN MERROW: It's there, but you
don't -- you haven't done it?

39:15.787 --> 39:22.060
EVA MOSKOWITZ: I mean, that's
not the context. A disciplinary
code is written to give maximum

39:22.060 --> 39:28.466
freedom. And we believe it's
preparing children for life.

39:28.466 --> 39:33.805
JOHN MERROW: Success Academies
are obviously doing something
right. Last year, 93 percent

39:33.805 --> 39:38.543
of Success Academy students
passed the state's math test,
compared to just 35 percent in

39:38.543 --> 39:42.313
the city's traditional
public schools.

39:42.313 --> 39:47.752
Could out-of-school suspensions
be a factor in the network's
academic success? Eva
Moskowitz's

39:47.752 --> 39:53.558
critics think so. They accuse
her of suspending very young
children over and over to
persuade

39:53.558 --> 39:59.731
parents to change schools before
state testing begins in third
grade. Could that be true?

39:59.731 --> 40:05.103
We do know that some Success
Academy students are suspended
over and over.

40:05.103 --> 40:11.509
The 44 suspensions at this
school were issued to just 11
kindergartners and first
graders.

40:11.509 --> 40:16.881
One child was suspended 12
times. Eventually, the family
withdrew the child. At another

40:16.881 --> 40:21.619
Success Academy, 101 suspensions
went to just 32 students.

40:21.619 --> 40:31.229
JAMIR GEIDI: I was suspended so
many times, it was just like --
it was just -- it was

40:31.229 --> 40:36.601
like, why do I even come here
every day if I just know that
I'm going to get suspended?

40:36.601 --> 40:41.372
JOHN MERROW: Jamir's mother told
us he was suspended three or
four times his first year

40:41.372 --> 40:45.310
for losing his temper. She said
she was also called two or three
times a week to pick him

40:45.310 --> 40:48.680
up early.

40:48.680 --> 40:53.084
Other parents told us their
young children were sent home
multiple times for infractions

40:53.084 --> 40:57.955
like not paying attention or for
getting out of their seats to
look at the bulletin board.

40:57.955 --> 41:04.929
Why do we hear so many stories,
and why do we keep meeting these
parents who say, early

41:04.929 --> 41:11.102
on, we were counseled out; our
kid was, like, sent home because
he would get up and go look

41:11.102 --> 41:12.837
at the bulletin
board, a 5-year-old?

41:12.837 --> 41:17.542
EVA MOSKOWITZ: First of all,
anecdotes don't make for
statistical trends.

41:17.542 --> 41:24.916
But, in my experience, you know,
parents often have a different
interpretation of what happened.

41:24.916 --> 41:31.089
I often have parents say to me,
my child never punched the
teacher. I say, well, but you

41:31.089 --> 41:33.691
weren't there.

41:33.691 --> 41:38.963
JOHN MERROW: Jamir's mother
withdrew him from Success
Academy after two-and-a-half
years.

41:38.963 --> 41:44.102
Now 10, he just began his third
year at a public school that
approaches discipline
differently.

41:44.102 --> 41:50.108
FATIMA GEIDI, Mother: Yes, Jamir
has had meltdowns. Yes, he has
anxiety. Yes, he's cried. Yes,

41:50.108 --> 41:54.479
he's had outbursts. But guess
what? The school says, fine, you
need a break. You're going

41:54.479 --> 41:57.982
to go help one of the
secretaries in the office. You
are going to shred paper. You
are going

41:57.982 --> 42:00.618
to go water the plants. You are
going to do something helpful.
When you are ready, you

42:00.618 --> 42:03.121
will come back. And guess what?
He is getting his education.

42:03.121 --> 42:09.527
JOHN MERROW: Do you ever use
out-of-school suspension as a
way to persuade parents that...

42:09.527 --> 42:16.768
EVA MOSKOWITZ: No. No. We don't
suspend in order to boost our
academics. Like, that's

42:16.768 --> 42:20.037
just crazy talk.

42:20.037 --> 42:24.976
JOHN MERROW: But our sources,
including several public school
principals, quite a few former

42:24.976 --> 42:31.783
Success Academy parents, and one
person inside her organization,
charge that is exactly what

42:31.783 --> 42:37.088
she does, repeatedly suspend
certain kids to push them out.
However, none of these critics

42:37.088 --> 42:40.591
were willing to publicly
confront Moskowitz.

42:40.591 --> 42:44.629
EVA MOSKOWITZ: Well, the numbers
just don't support that, John. I
mean, what you get is

42:44.629 --> 42:49.300
what you see, which is
suspending kids doesn't lead to
high attrition rate. That is
what

42:49.300 --> 42:51.702
the data shows.

42:51.702 --> 42:56.641
JOHN MERROW: In fact, the
attrition rate is at least twice
that of another major charter

42:56.641 --> 43:02.647
network, KIPP. A Success Academy
representative told thaws for
every 100 new students, at

43:02.647 --> 43:07.051
least 10 leave before the year's
out, most of them in the first
few months. They are

43:07.051 --> 43:11.189
then replaced by students
chosen from the waiting list.

43:11.189 --> 43:16.794
In the end, how charter schools
conduct their business is
basically their own business.

43:16.794 --> 43:22.300
New York could demand detailed
information about out-of-school
suspensions, but they

43:22.300 --> 43:26.304
allow all charter schools, not
just Eva Moskowitz's Success
Academies, to set their own
rules.

43:26.304 --> 43:34.412
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Merrow, reporting from New York
City.

43:34.412 --> 43:47.859
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we begin
a three-part series entitled
Congo's Hope.

43:47.859 --> 43:52.997
The Democratic Republic of Congo
is one of the world's poorest
countries as a result

43:52.997 --> 43:58.402
of colonialism, misrule and,
most recently, war, and this
despite being endowed with
precious

43:58.402 --> 44:01.372
natural resources.

44:01.372 --> 44:06.844
Our series marks the debut of
"NewsHour"'s contributing editor
Soledad O'Brien.

44:06.844 --> 44:12.049
She begins the series in Goma, a
city on the shores of Lake Kivu,
and the place where Congolese

44:12.049 --> 44:20.124
NBA player Bismack Biyombo
returned this summer.

44:20.124 --> 44:32.136
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Bismack Biyombo
comes ashore on the banks of
Lake Kivu like a jolly lean

44:32.136 --> 44:40.611
giant, young, handsome, 6'9''.
He is 22 years old, a center in
the NBA who towers above

44:40.611 --> 44:44.382
this village of coffee growers.

44:44.382 --> 44:51.289
And that is not where the
contrast ends. Just hours
earlier, Biyombo signed a
two-year $6

44:51.289 --> 44:54.625
million contract to play
basketball for the Toronto
Raptors.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.361
BISMACK BIYOMBO, Toronto
Raptors: Done. I'm a Raptor.

44:57.361 --> 45:02.867
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Signing right
here in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, one of the poorest

45:02.867 --> 45:05.670
countries in the world.

45:05.670 --> 45:12.009
BISMACK BIYOMBO: I grew up here.
I dreamed one day about being in
the NBA. And the process

45:12.009 --> 45:16.714
that I have been through to be
able to make it, and then come
back here and sign it from

45:16.714 --> 45:19.317
here is just -- it's that
feeling that I can't explain.

45:19.317 --> 45:22.887
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Why do
you come back to Congo?

45:22.887 --> 45:28.392
BISMACK BIYOMBO: I love the
people. I love the potential of
this place. And I think we

45:28.392 --> 45:31.429
have a bright future.

45:31.429 --> 45:37.735
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Biyombo is of
the Congo, perhaps even a
metaphor for what it might

45:37.735 --> 45:42.974
be. He was born in Lubumbashi on
the southeast end of the
country.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.642
What was your childhood
like in Lubumbashi?

45:44.642 --> 45:47.578
BISMACK BIYOMBO: Like, we
were eating once a day.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.981
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: One meal a day?

45:49.981 --> 45:54.151
BISMACK BIYOMBO: One meal a day,
because you cannot afford. But
I'm actually glad of those

45:54.151 --> 45:55.286
things happen to me.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.088
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Really? Why?

45:57.088 --> 46:00.925
BISMACK BIYOMBO: Because it
teach me. That's what help me to
come back here and help.

46:00.925 --> 46:06.430
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Like Congo, he
was rich with potential, but low
on prospects. He was discovered

46:06.430 --> 46:11.902
by a Portuguese coach and played
in Spain before being drafted to
the NBA.

46:11.902 --> 46:17.475
BISMACK BIYOMBO: Every time I
think about the way I got to the
NBA, it is a motivation

46:17.475 --> 46:21.812
to myself, and I'm
thankful for it.

46:21.812 --> 46:29.020
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Biyombo is
traveling with the Eastern Congo
Initiative, ECI, the brainchild

46:29.020 --> 46:36.027
of actor Ben Affleck, which
focuses in the area around Goma,
a place scarred by volcanoes,

46:36.027 --> 46:43.534
overrun by refugees, and
repeatedly, for the last two
decades, at war over its rich
minerals.

46:43.534 --> 46:48.372
Congo is fighting to do what
Biyombo did: pick itself up off
the floor.

46:48.372 --> 46:52.476
BISMACK BIYOMBO: It's good to
see people trying to help us put
it together. But more than

46:52.476 --> 46:56.347
anything, it's that I
believe in human resources.

46:56.347 --> 47:03.020
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: ECI showed
Biyombo an example of those
resources in these hills.

47:03.020 --> 47:09.560
Here, a sleeping coffee industry
is waking up, as a string of aid
organizations are building

47:09.560 --> 47:15.466
infrastructure and training
workers. The newest customer for
the arabica coffee is Starbucks.

47:15.466 --> 47:20.805
Baraka Kasali manages the
initiative that works with 4,000
farmers.

47:20.805 --> 47:25.409
There has been coffee in this
community for 30 years. I mean,
the farmer we met said his

47:25.409 --> 47:29.914
grandfather is the one who
brought the coffee plants and
planted them 30 years ago.

47:29.914 --> 47:30.681
BARAKA KASALI, Eastern Congo
Initiative: They haven't
received the value for that
coffee.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.650
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Why not?

47:32.650 --> 47:37.521
BARAKA KASALI: Because they
haven't had access to the
markets. So we partner with
them. We

47:37.521 --> 47:40.391
were able to be a catalyst to
bring in folks, like USAID and
the Howard Buffett Foundation,

47:40.391 --> 47:45.029
and say, hey, here's an
opportunity to invest in people.

47:45.029 --> 47:49.867
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The work has
transformed the life of this
woman and her children. This

47:49.867 --> 47:56.407
is her old home, and this one
the new, bought and built with
coffee money.

47:56.407 --> 48:01.078
The program is one of several
that NGOs are promoting, with
the goal of creating a
sustainable

48:01.078 --> 48:05.583
society for the Congolese, one
with economic development at the
forefront, rather than

48:05.583 --> 48:07.218
war.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.120
DARIO MERLO, Executive Director,
Eastern Congo Initiative: Peace
and stability will one day

48:09.120 --> 48:11.422
be a reality in this country.

48:11.422 --> 48:16.093
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Dario Merlo
is executive director of ECI.

48:16.093 --> 48:20.364
Is it realistic to think that a
country that literally for the
last 20 years has been in

48:20.364 --> 48:23.501
conflict can turn it around?

48:23.501 --> 48:25.936
DARIO MERLO: You need to invest
in people. People are ready to
do something for their

48:25.936 --> 48:28.139
country.

48:28.139 --> 48:34.111
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The DRC, the
largest country in sub-Saharan
Africa, is a compilation of

48:34.111 --> 48:40.017
sad statistics. The life
expectancy is in the 50s. The
infant mortality rate is among

48:40.017 --> 48:45.222
the highest in the world. Hunger
and starvation are commonplace.

48:45.222 --> 48:51.395
DARIO MERLO: This is a country
with extraordinary people, and
when you add it to the potential

48:51.395 --> 48:56.433
in minerals, in forest, clean
water, you know, such a
resilience from nature, from
people,

48:56.433 --> 48:58.269
from everything.

48:58.269 --> 49:02.673
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: That means that
successful Congolese like
Biyombo must do more than just

49:02.673 --> 49:05.376
encourage business.

49:05.376 --> 49:08.879
What does hope come in the form
of? Is that, hey, you just got a
big contract; you are

49:08.879 --> 49:13.250
going to write some seriously
big checks? Is it, you're going
to come and visit? What

49:13.250 --> 49:15.920
is -- describe specifically
what hope looks like.

49:15.920 --> 49:23.160
BISMACK BIYOMBO: Well, to me is
to be able to establish
companies that will create jobs,

49:23.160 --> 49:30.668
give people jobs, establish
schools, that kids will be able
to go and get an education,

49:30.668 --> 49:35.706
and then establish farms where
people actually can eat,
because, if you don't eat, you
cannot

49:35.706 --> 49:38.108
work.

49:38.108 --> 49:45.182
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: To fill those
jobs, Congo needs a well-trained
work force. Here, young

49:45.182 --> 49:50.554
people learn new skills, like
carpentry, auto repair, and
plumbing. This young woman told

49:50.554 --> 49:53.691
Biyombo she wants
to be a mechanic.

49:53.691 --> 49:59.063
BISMACK BIYOMBO: What she said
to me was touching, because she
said that, I wanted to do
mechanic,

49:59.063 --> 50:03.500
because it's not just a man's
job, and I don't want people to
think this is just a man's

50:03.500 --> 50:05.336
job.

50:05.336 --> 50:10.307
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: For Biyombo,
this is a very different Congo
than the one he left. Goma,

50:10.307 --> 50:16.313
where the program runs, was in
the crossfire of a civil war
just two years ago. The
population

50:16.313 --> 50:24.788
was on the run from violence.
Now people are dropping their
arms and picking up tools.

50:24.788 --> 50:29.960
Jobs aren't all this community
needs to prosper. They need to
get along. Biyombo also came

50:29.960 --> 50:33.731
here to run a basketball clinic.

50:33.731 --> 50:42.072
DARIO MERLO: For all of us, he
is this national hero. Every
professional athlete must show

50:42.072 --> 50:47.077
some discipline, hard work, and
all these value, you want him to
actually share that

50:47.077 --> 50:53.617
with the kids, especially in
post-conflict area, because kids
who play together, when

50:53.617 --> 50:57.521
they grow up, you realize that,
actually, difference and
diversity is a richness, that

50:57.521 --> 51:00.391
it's not something you
should be afraid of.

51:00.391 --> 51:05.596
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: For Biyombo,
this is fun in a country where
there has been too little,

51:05.596 --> 51:11.368
a place where he no longer wants
to see the ugliness, but the
beauty, like the vast rich

51:11.368 --> 51:17.808
farmland which could grow an
economy, or the rare gorillas
that could attract new tourism.

51:17.808 --> 51:22.379
The story of Congo, to him, is
all of this, and the potential
of a people who have resilience

51:22.379 --> 51:25.215
at their core.

51:25.215 --> 51:31.622
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Soledad O'Brien in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

51:31.622 --> 51:39.997
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our series
Congo's Hope continues tomorrow.
Soledad profiles a Congolese
filmmaker

51:39.997 --> 51:58.716
who is bringing movies and
moviemaking to his country.

51:58.716 --> 52:04.154
Finally tonight, we want to note
the passing of longtime Secret
Service agent Jerry Parr.

52:04.154 --> 52:08.525
He was with Ronald Reagan at the
Washington Hilton Hotel in 1981
when the president was

52:08.525 --> 52:10.394
shot.

52:10.394 --> 52:15.432
A few years ago, the "NewsHour"
returned to that hotel, and Parr
explained what happened

52:15.432 --> 52:19.470
that day, just moments after the
shots rang out and he
immediately shoved the president

52:19.470 --> 52:21.672
into his waiting limousine:

52:21.672 --> 52:26.210
JERRY PARR, Former Secret
Service Agent: I ran my hands up
under his coat, his hair,

52:26.210 --> 52:33.484
everything, and found no blood.
So that's when I radioed back,
Rawhide is OK.

52:33.484 --> 52:40.691
But in Dupont Circle, or very
close to it, he started frothing
-- frothing bright red

52:40.691 --> 52:46.764
blood, and he was dripping it on
my coat, so I said, "I am taking
you to the hospital."

52:46.764 --> 52:51.068
He either said OK or he nodded
to me. And I was very, very
worried.

52:51.068 --> 52:55.773
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was also there
that day. Jerry Parr is a
remarkable man.

52:55.773 --> 52:59.309
You can hear the rest of his
description of the day and his
career in the Secret Service

52:59.309 --> 53:02.379
at our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:02.379 --> 53:07.184
And our condolences
to his family.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.686
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:09.686 --> 53:14.591
On Tuesday, I sit down with Bob
Woodward and the source of his
new book, Nixon White House

53:14.591 --> 53:18.495
aide Alexander Butterfield, who
has kept secrets until now.

53:18.495 --> 53:20.898
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:20.898 --> 53:24.001
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

53:24.001 --> 53:24.368
you, and good night.
