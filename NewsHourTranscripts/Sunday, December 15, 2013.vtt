VERY FEW COUNTRIES COULD

OVERCOME

05:38.633 --> 05:39.900
THE FACT THAT IT'S COME THIS FAR

05:39.900 --> 05:41.167
IS A MIRACLE

05:41.167 --> 05:43.133
I THINK SOUTH AFRICANS, WHEN

THEY TALK ABOUT MANDELA AND WHAT

EXACT OPPOSITE OF MANDELA'

07:30.500 --> 07:30.700
AFTER THAT WHEN MANDELA'S MEMORY

07:33.733 --> 07:35.433
RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS

07:44.333 --> 07:46.033
YOU'LL SEE THE BLACK MASSES, I

07:46.033 --> 07:48.100
THINK, PROBABLY LESS PATIENT AND

07:48.100 --> 07:49.867
SAYING THE AMC MUST HAVE

07:49.867 --> 07:52.833
STRONGER POLICIES, MORE RADICA

07:55.533 --> 07:58.067
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE AN

07:58.067 --> 07:59.100
POLITICS CHANGE AND YOU'LL SEE

07:59.100 --> 08:00.933
THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS GO AWAY

FROM THE ANC AND BLACK WORKING

08:03.600 --> 08:05.600

17:58.267 --> 17:59.533
THEY A NECESSARY EVIL?

17:59.533 --> 18:00.600
HOW DO YOU VIEW IT

18:00.600 --> 18:03.533
>> IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY

18:03.533 --> 18:04.967
PEOPLE WOULD PAY THOSE PRICES IF

18:04.967 --> 18:07.467
THERE IS A BANK NEARBY, RIGHT?

18:07.467 --> 18:09.233
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THE ON THE

GROUND DECISION MAKING PEOPL

18:10.333 --> 18:11.233

18:11.233 --> 18:13.900
IT'S A LEAP FROM LOOKING AT TH

18:13.900 --> 18:15.133
FACTS OF THE FEES TO SAYING IT

18:15.133 --> 18:17.800
MUST BE BAD AND ABUSIVE.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.567
AND IT'S A LOGICAL LEAP, RIGHT

18:20.567 --> 18:21.600
UNLESS YOU GO DOWN THERE AND

18:21.600 --> 18:26.567
TALK TO PEOPLE, IT'S NOT

18:26.567 --> 18:27.133
OBVIOUS.

18:38.933 --> 18:41.100
IT RECEIVES A REPORT FROM

18:41.100 --> 18:42.267
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY GROU

18:42.267 --> 18:44.167
ASKED TO RECOMMEND CHANGES I

18:44.167 --> 18:46.233
THE NATION'S SURVEILLANC

18:46.233 --> 18:46.567
PROGRAMS

18:46.567 --> 18:48.633

18:48.633 --> 18:50.033
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON B

DAVID SANGER, HE'S THE NATIONA

18:52.133 --> 18:54.300
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR "TH

18:54.300 --> 18:54.733
NEW YORK TIMES."

18:54.733 --> 18:56.133
DAVID, WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS DO

18:56.133 --> 18:58.133
YOU THINK THE GROUP MADE AND

18:58.133 --> 19:00.733
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT LIKELY TO

19:00.733 --> 19:01.733
DO WITH THEM

19:01.733 --> 19:04.167
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT

19:04.167 --> 19:06.267
A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

19:06.267 --> 19:07.600
THAT ARE IN THE REPORT

19:07.600 --> 19:10.167
THERE ARE MORE THAN 40 TOTAL

19:10.167 --> 19:11.333
RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THE REPORT,

19:11.333 --> 19:13.833
WHILE NOT CLASSIFIED IS GOING TO

19:13.833 --> 19:15.100
REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL THE WHIT

19:15.100 --> 19:16.367
HOUSE SAYS UNTIL THE PRESIDENT

19:16.367 --> 19:17.900
HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT AN

19:17.900 --> 19:20.100
MAKE DECISIONS

19:20.100 --> 19:22.133
BUT A FEW THINGS WE DO KNOW, THE

19:22.133 --> 19:24.333
FIRST IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HA

19:24.333 --> 19:26.367
DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE BULK

19:26.367 --> 19:29.100
COLLECTION OF DOMESTICALLY

19:29.100 --> 19:31.367
GATHERED TELEPHONE NUMBERS

19:31.367 --> 19:32.967
THESE ARE THE VERY CONTROVERSIAL

19:32.967 --> 19:35.733
PROGRAM THAT WAS REVEALED BY THE

19:35.733 --> 19:38.167
SNOWDEN DOCUMENTS, EDWAR

19:38.167 --> 19:41.500
SNOWDEN DOCUMENTS, WHICH

19:41.500 --> 19:42.567
INVOLVES THE UNITED STATES

19:42.567 --> 19:44.667
KEEPING RECORDS BACK ABOUT FIV

19:44.667 --> 19:46.700
YEARS OF EVERY TELEPHONE CAL

19:46.700 --> 19:49.633
THAT IS MADE FROM THE UNITED

19:49.633 --> 19:50.367
STATES IN THE UNITED STATES AN

19:50.367 --> 19:52.467
WHAT NUMBER THAT CALL WAS MADE

19:52.467 --> 19:52.600
TO

19:52.600 --> 19:55.033
IT DOES NOT RECORD

19:55.033 --> 19:55.300
CONVERSATIONS.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.967
THE SECOND BIG DECISION WE KNO

19:56.967 --> 19:58.400
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE AND WHITE

19:58.400 --> 20:00.200
HOUSE ANNOUNCED IS THAT TH

20:00.200 --> 20:02.867
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY IS NO

20:02.867 --> 20:05.767
GOING TO BE SPLIT OFF FROM U.S

20:05.767 --> 20:08.300
NOW CYBER COMMAND IS THE

20:08.300 --> 20:09.900
PENTAGON'S BRANCH THAT BOT

20:09.900 --> 20:12.033
DEFENDS THE PENTAGON'S NETWORK

20:12.033 --> 20:13.933
AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS AND PUTS

20:13.933 --> 20:15.800
TOGETHER OFFENSIVE ATTACKS

20:15.800 --> 20:17.233
SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT TH

20:17.233 --> 20:19.533
UNITED STATES CONDUCTED ON IRA

20:19.533 --> 20:21.067
A FEW YEARS AGO.

20:21.067 --> 20:22.267
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONCERNE

20:22.267 --> 20:24.233
THAT PUTS TOO MUCH POWER IN TH

20:24.233 --> 20:26.100
HANDS OF ONE MILITARY COMMANDER.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.367
THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO G

20:27.367 --> 20:28.033
AHEAD WITH IT.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.767
>> I'M STRUCK BY THE COMBINATION

20:29.767 --> 20:32.667
IN YOUR STORIES AND THIS ISSUE

20:32.667 --> 20:34.800
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE PERCEIVED

20:34.800 --> 20:38.733
NEED FOR SOME SORT O

20:38.733 --> 20:41.233
TRANSPARENCY AND YET, THE PUBLIC

20:41.233 --> 20:43.300
NOT SEEMING TO BE TOO ALARMED ON

20:43.300 --> 20:45.167
THIS OR AT LEAST GIVING TH

20:45.167 --> 20:46.667
GOVERNMENT SOME LEEWAY ON THIS

20:46.667 --> 20:49.600
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE PUBLIC'

20:49.600 --> 20:51.800
RIGHT TO KNOW, IN THIS CASE LIKE

20:51.800 --> 20:54.467
THE PUBLIC DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.300
DO YOU SENSE THE PUSH AND PULL

20:56.300 --> 20:57.400
>> YOU CERTAINLY DO.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.667
THERE WAS A BIT OF A SENSE RIGHT

20:59.667 --> 21:02.500
NOW THAT THE COMMITTEE THA

21:02.500 --> 21:04.600
REPORTED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WA

21:04.600 --> 21:06.200
IN FACT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

21:06.200 --> 21:08.100
AGGRESSIVE IN TALKING ABOU

21:08.100 --> 21:10.333
CUTTING BACK ON SOME OF THES

21:10.333 --> 21:12.900
PROGRAMS THAN THE PUBLIC HAS A

21:12.900 --> 21:14.800
LEAST ARTICULATED SO FAR

21:14.800 --> 21:16.400
WE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE, I

21:16.400 --> 21:18.167
FACT, WANTS TO HAV

21:18.167 --> 21:19.233
SIGNIFICANTLY GREATE

21:19.233 --> 21:21.533
TRANSPARENCY FOR A NUMBER OF THE

21:21.533 --> 21:22.033
PROGRAMS

21:22.033 --> 21:24.167
THERE'S A GOOD INDICATION THAT

21:24.167 --> 21:26.400
THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF MAKING SURE

21:26.400 --> 21:27.533
THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT GOES TO

21:27.533 --> 21:31.333
GET A WARRANT FROM THE FOREIGN

21:31.333 --> 21:33.133
INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COUR

21:33.133 --> 21:34.667
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE TO ARGU

21:34.667 --> 21:36.267
THE OTHER SIDE, THE PRIVACY SIDE

21:36.267 --> 21:36.800
OF THAT.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.567
THAT'S BEEN DEBATED SOME I

21:39.567 --> 21:40.700
ELITE CIRCLES IN THE UNITE
