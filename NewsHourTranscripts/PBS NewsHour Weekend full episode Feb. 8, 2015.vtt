WE TURN NOW TO OUR CONTINUING

06:00.060 --> 06:02.028

06:02.028 --> 06:04.364
>> ISIL IS AT AN ENTIRELY

06:04.364 --> 06:06.066
DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN AL-QAEDA

06:06.066 --> 06:07.467
WAS.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.469
BETTER ORGANIZED.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.271
ITS COMMAND AND CONTROL IS

06:11.271 --> 06:11.871
BETTER.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.806
WE SHOULD TAKE IT VERY

06:12.806 --> 06:13.807
SERIOUSLY.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.008
TO HELP US ANALYZE THESE

06:15.008 --> 06:15.942
DEVELOPMENTS, WE ARE JOINED FROM

06:15.942 --> 06:16.876
WASHINGTON D.C. BY ANTHONY

06:16.876 --> 06:17.711
CORDESMAN OF THE CENTER FOR

06:17.711 --> 06:18.478
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

06:18.478 --> 06:19.179
STUDIES, MR. CORDESMAN

06:19.179 --> 06:19.946
PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE STATE

06:19.946 --> 06:20.814
DEPARTMENT AND WAS THE DIRECTOR

06:20.814 --> 06:21.581
OF INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT IN

06:21.581 --> 06:22.315
THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF

06:22.315 --> 06:26.286
DEFENSE.

06:26.286 --> 06:26.987
>> MR. CORDESMAN, I WOULD

06:26.987 --> 06:28.688
LIKE TO START WITH JORDAN

06:28.688 --> 06:29.422
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN

06:29.422 --> 06:30.056
SIGNIFICANT ACTION.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.391
FIRST THE EXECUTION OF TWO

06:31.391 --> 06:33.026
MEMBERS OF ISIS, AND OF

06:33.026 --> 06:34.594
COURSE KING ABDULLAH SAYING

06:34.594 --> 06:35.895
THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO USE

06:35.895 --> 06:37.597
HIS MILITARY UNTIL, QUOTE,

06:37.597 --> 06:38.965
THEY RUN OUT OF FUEL AND

06:38.965 --> 06:40.200
BULLET ITS.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.435
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS

06:42.435 --> 06:43.470
JORDAN'S CAPACITY IN THIS

06:43.470 --> 06:44.971
MANNER TO FIGHT ISIS?

06:44.971 --> 06:46.840
>> IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE AIR

06:46.840 --> 06:47.240
FORCE.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.310
IT FLIES THE IF H 16, IT HAS

06:50.310 --> 06:52.045
MODERN AIR SURFACE ORDNANCE

06:52.045 --> 06:53.380
TO CARRY OUT PRECISION

06:53.380 --> 06:53.747
STRIKES.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.082
IT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO GET

06:56.082 --> 06:57.851
TARGETING INFORMATION FROM

06:57.851 --> 06:59.319
U.S. INTELLIGENCE

06:59.319 --> 07:00.687
CAPABILITIES.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.422
AND TARGETING IS ABSOLUTELY

07:02.422 --> 07:03.456
CRITICAL TO THIS KIND OF

07:03.456 --> 07:04.424
OPERATION.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.493
SO WHEN JORDAN COMMITS A

07:06.493 --> 07:08.194
LARGE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT, IT

07:08.194 --> 07:09.896
REALLY DOES MEAN SOMETHING.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.331
>> TELL ME WHY TARGETING IS

07:11.331 --> 07:11.698
CRITICAL.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.033
>> WELL, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

07:13.033 --> 07:15.368
YOU HAVE AT ANY TIME IS WHEN

07:15.368 --> 07:18.438
YOU HAVE A DISPERSED

07:18.438 --> 07:19.706
NONSTATE ACTOR, A FORCE THAT

07:19.706 --> 07:22.309
DOESN'T WEAR UNIFORMS, THAT

07:22.309 --> 07:24.444
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF HEAVY

07:24.444 --> 07:25.712
MILITARY I

07:25.712 --> 07:27.013
EQUIPMENT,-- EQUIPMENT, YOU

07:27.013 --> 07:28.415
NEED ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE

07:28.415 --> 07:29.182
ASSETS TO KNOW WHERE THEY

07:29.182 --> 07:30.216
ARE AND THEN YOU ALSO NEED

07:30.216 --> 07:31.217
TO KNOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO

07:31.217 --> 07:32.652
STRIKE AT THEM, YOU'RE NOT

07:32.652 --> 07:33.720
GOING TO STRIKE AT

07:33.720 --> 07:34.988
CIVILIANS.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.156
YOUR TARGET IS REALLY GOING

07:36.156 --> 07:39.059
TO BE THE ENEMY.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.394
THERE ALSO IS THE PROBLEM OF

07:41.394 --> 07:42.195
HOW DO YOU LOCATE THE MOST

07:42.195 --> 07:43.863
IMPORTANT TARGETS AND THAT

07:43.863 --> 07:46.499
REQUIRES THE KIND OF

07:46.499 --> 07:49.502
SATELLITE DATA, THE KIND OF

07:49.502 --> 07:50.670
SATELLITE INTELLIGENCE

07:50.670 --> 07:51.371
CAPABILITY THAT REALLY ONLY

07:51.371 --> 07:52.539
THE UNITED STATES CAN

07:52.539 --> 07:53.373
PROVIDE.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.674
>> KNOWING WHERE THE

07:54.674 --> 07:56.776
LEADERSHIP IS DO WE KNOW,

07:56.776 --> 07:57.777
HOW DO WE KNOW AND IF WE

07:57.777 --> 07:59.145
DON'T, HOW DO WE FIND OUT?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.847
>> WE USE A PROCESS WHICH

08:00.847 --> 08:02.749
SOME PEOPLE CALL FUSION,

08:02.749 --> 08:05.652
YOU'RE NOT RELYING SIMPLY ON

08:05.652 --> 08:08.822
THINGS LIKE UNMANNED AERIAL

08:08.822 --> 08:10.290
VEHICLES, YOU'RE NOT RELYING

08:10.290 --> 08:12.559
ON PHOTO OR IMAGERY

08:12.559 --> 08:13.993
SATELLITES OR ANY OTHER ONE

08:13.993 --> 08:14.928
INDICATOR ALONE.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.696
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.698
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SLIP,

08:18.698 --> 08:20.033
WHEN THEY SEND A MESSAGE

08:20.033 --> 08:21.067
THEY SHOULDN'T SEND.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.435
YOU'RE TRACKING MOVEMENTS IN

08:22.435 --> 08:23.837
AND OUT.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.538
AND YOU'RE TYING THESE

08:25.538 --> 08:26.906
TOGETHER IN NEAR REALTIME SO

08:26.906 --> 08:28.274
YOU CAN PROVIDE THE

08:28.274 --> 08:30.710
TARGETING DATA FOR AIRCRAFT

08:30.710 --> 08:33.279
OR FOR THESE UNMANNED COMBAT

08:33.279 --> 08:33.780
AERIAL VEHICLES.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.149
>> I CAN REMEMBER BEING IN A

08:36.149 --> 08:38.518
BACKGROUND SESSION WITH A

08:38.518 --> 08:39.552
MILITARY ANALYST WHO ONCE

08:39.552 --> 08:40.987
SAID ABOUT AL QAEDA, THAT

08:40.987 --> 08:42.288
YOU CAN'T THINK OF IT AS

08:42.288 --> 08:43.356
WHAT YOU THINK OF AN ARMY.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.058
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT AS A

08:45.058 --> 08:45.725
MOVEMENT.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.293
IS ISIS THE SAME?

08:47.293 --> 08:49.162
>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS

08:49.162 --> 08:50.096
DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.132
IT'S NOT I-- NOT A REGULAR

08:52.132 --> 08:53.900
FIGHTING FORCE, BUT UNLIKE

08:53.900 --> 08:55.001
TERRORIST GROUPS, IT CAN

08:55.001 --> 08:55.769
FIGHT.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.004
AND IT COULD DEFEAT THE

08:58.004 --> 08:58.738
IRAQI ARMY.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.373
SO IT IS SOMEWHERE IN

09:00.373 --> 09:03.476
BETWEEN AN ARMY AND A

09:03.476 --> 09:04.177
TERRORIST FORCE.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.845
>> WE TALKED ABOUT JORDAN'S

09:05.845 --> 09:06.946
EFFECTIVENESS.

09:06.946 --> 09:07.981
HOW ABOUT OTHER PLAYERS IN

09:07.981 --> 09:08.648
THE REGION?

09:08.648 --> 09:10.116
>> WELL, AT THIS POINT IN

09:10.116 --> 09:11.451
TIME WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

09:11.451 --> 09:14.421
THE THREATS THAT THE ISLAMIC

09:14.421 --> 09:17.157
STATE OR ISIS FACES, IT'S

09:17.157 --> 09:18.291
LARGELY AIR POWER.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.226
YOU HAVE SOME GOOD AIR

09:20.226 --> 09:21.928
FORCES, IT ISN'T JUST JORDAN,

09:21.928 --> 09:23.296
IT IS THE UNITED ARAB

09:23.296 --> 09:23.963
EMIRATE.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.331
MOST OF THE ARAB FORCES ARE

09:25.331 --> 09:25.999
QUITE CAPABLE.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.934
CERTAINLY OUR NATO ALLIES,

09:27.934 --> 09:29.135
FORCES LIKE AUSTRALIA ARE

09:29.135 --> 09:30.804
VERY EFFECTIVE.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.772
BUT THE KEY PROBLEMS ARE

09:32.772 --> 09:35.909
THAT THE IRAQI ARMY IS STILL

09:35.909 --> 09:36.843
VERY WEAK.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.078
IT HAS NOT RECOVERED FROM

09:39.078 --> 09:41.414
THE DICTATORSHIP OR ALMOST

09:41.414 --> 09:43.116
DICTATORSHIP OF MALIKI.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.151
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE AT

09:45.151 --> 09:47.020
LEAST MONTHS MORE BEFORE IT

09:47.020 --> 09:49.155
CAN HAVE EVEN LIMITED

09:49.155 --> 09:50.623
OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.659
AND WHEN WE COME TO SYRIA WE

09:52.659 --> 09:54.027
NEED TO REMEMBER A LOT OF

09:54.027 --> 09:55.628
THE FIGHTING IS THERE.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.163
THE FACT IS THAT IT ISN'T

09:57.163 --> 09:58.798
JUST THE ISLAMIC STATE.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.201
THE FORCE THAT DEFEATED THE

10:01.201 --> 10:03.937
REBELS THAT WE HAD BACKED

10:03.937 --> 10:06.406
MOST AND SHIPPED ARMS TO IS

10:06.406 --> 10:09.509
THE AL NOUSSRA FRONT WHICH

10:09.509 --> 10:11.144
IS ALLIED TO AL QAEDA.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.645
ALMOST ALL OF THE MOVEMENTS

10:12.645 --> 10:13.880
THAT ARE REBEL MOVEMENTS

10:13.880 --> 10:15.315
THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE FIELD

10:15.315 --> 10:16.316
HAVE SOME SORT OF ISLAMIST

10:16.316 --> 10:17.350
CHARACTER.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.218
SO THE PROBLEM THERE IS IT

10:18.218 --> 10:20.753
ISN'T JUST THE AL NOUSSRA

10:20.753 --> 10:22.755
FRONT, IT'S BOTH THE REBELS

10:22.755 --> 10:24.057
AND TO SOME EXTENT, OF

10:24.057 --> 10:26.125
COURSE, THE ASSAD FORCES.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.460
IT'S NOT JUST ONE THREAT

10:27.460 --> 10:29.562
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.530
>> ANTHONY CORDESMAN, THANK

10:30.530 --> 10:31.764
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

10:31.764 --> 10:32.232
ANALYSIS.

10:32.232 --> 10:42.642
>> A PLEASURE.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.277
>> Stewart: AND NOW TO OUR

10:44.277 --> 10:45.278
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.379
OUR ORIGINAL IN-DEPTH REPORTS

10:46.379 --> 10:48.081
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.115
LAST MONTH'S TERROR ATTACK AT A

10:49.115 --> 10:50.283
KOSHER STORE IN PARIS CALLED

10:50.283 --> 10:51.651
ATTENTION TO RISING ANTI-

10:51.651 --> 10:52.585
SEMITISM IN FRANCE AND THE

10:52.585 --> 10:53.520
GROWING NUMBER OF INCIDENTS

10:53.520 --> 10:54.854
THROUGHOUT EUROPE.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.122
IN RESPONSE TO THAT TERROR

10:56.122 --> 10:57.357
ATTACK, AND THE ONE ON THE

10:57.357 --> 10:58.258
FRENCH SATIRICAL MAGAZINE,

10:58.258 --> 10:58.958
FRENCH AUTHORITIES DEPLOYED

10:58.958 --> 11:02.662
THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO BOOST

11:02.662 --> 11:04.264
SECURITY AT SENSITIVE SITES,

11:04.264 --> 11:05.198
INCLUDING BOTH MOSQUES AND

11:05.198 --> 11:06.466
SYNAGOGUES.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.600
BUT THIS WEEK, ATTACKERS SLASHED

11:07.600 --> 11:08.868
THREE SOLDIERS GUARDING A JEWISH

11:08.868 --> 11:10.136
COMMUNITY CENTER IN NICE.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.237
FRENCH AUTHORITIES BELIEVE A

11:11.237 --> 11:12.272
SMALL NUMBER OF RADICALIZED

11:12.272 --> 11:13.540
YOUNG MEN FROM NORTH AFRICA ARE

11:13.540 --> 11:14.974
RESPONSIBLE FOR A DIS-

11:14.974 --> 11:16.509
PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ANTI-

11:16.509 --> 11:17.410
SEMITIC INCIDENTS IN FRANCE.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.878
EVEN SO, SOME JEWS IN FRANCE

11:18.878 --> 11:20.380
FEEL UNDER SIEGE.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.447
AND A RECORD NUMBER ARE FLEEING

11:21.447 --> 11:23.883
TO ISRAEL.

11:23.883 --> 11:24.918
SPECIAL NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT

11:24.918 --> 11:26.252
MARTIN HIMEL TRAVELED TO FRANCE,

11:26.252 --> 11:27.353
EGYPT AND SWEDEN BEFORE FILING

11:27.353 --> 11:34.661
THIS REPORT.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.162
>> Reporter: THIS IS

11:36.162 --> 11:37.630
GARGES-LEÈS-GONESSE, A PARTISAN

11:37.630 --> 11:38.965
SUBURB, WHERE THE SYNAGOGUE

11:38.965 --> 11:40.333
SHAARE RAHAMIM WAS BUILT MORE

11:40.333 --> 11:41.701
THAN 60 YEARS AGO.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.969
IT'S NOW SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF

11:42.969 --> 11:44.237
WHAT HAS BECOME A MOSTLY MUSLIM

11:44.237 --> 11:45.705
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.973
JEWS HERE SAY THEY HAVE BEEN

11:46.973 --> 11:48.341
REGULARLY SUBJECTED TO

11:48.341 --> 11:53.446
ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.914
>> (translated): IT'S A REAL

11:54.914 --> 11:57.483
BUNKER, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

11:57.483 --> 11:58.585
TO REASSURE THE CONGREGANTS.

11:58.585 --> 11:59.719
OTHERWISE WE'D HAVE TO MOVE OUT

11:59.719 --> 12:01.020
OF THE SYNAGOGUE.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.255
>> Reporter: THIS APARTMENT

12:02.255 --> 12:03.823
BLOCK IS REALLY ON THE FRONTLINE

12:03.823 --> 12:05.091
OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS

12:05.091 --> 12:06.492
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND THE JEWS

12:06.492 --> 12:07.760
THAT WORSHIP IN THE SYNAGOGUE TO

12:07.760 --> 12:08.995
MY RIGHT.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.196
IT'S FROM THIS APARTMENT BLOCK

12:10.196 --> 12:11.664
THAT A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL HAS BEEN

12:11.664 --> 12:12.632
THROWN AT THE SYNAGOGUE, ROCKS

12:12.632 --> 12:13.366
HAVE BEEN THROWN AT THE

12:13.366 --> 12:14.534
SYNAGOGUE, EVEN A BULLET HAS

12:14.534 --> 12:15.969
BEEN FIRED FROM THIS DIRECTION.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.604
JEWS AT THE SYNAGOGUE TOLD US

12:17.604 --> 12:18.571
THEY TYPICALLY SUMMON THE POLICE

12:18.571 --> 12:19.806
A FEW TIMES A WEEK.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.007
AND WHEN THE POLICE COME, THEY

12:21.007 --> 12:22.475
DOCUMENT THE NEW GRAFFITI:

12:22.475 --> 12:24.644
SWASTIKAS, "SALE JUIF," WHICH

12:24.644 --> 12:27.714
MEANS "DIRTY JEW."

12:27.714 --> 12:31.017
>> IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S NOT THE

12:31.017 --> 12:33.386
BEST PLACE FOR A JEWISH

12:33.386 --> 12:35.521
COMMUNITY.

12:35.521 --> 12:36.990
BUT WE'RE HERE, SO WE HAVE TO

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
GET ON WITH IT.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.859
>> Reporter: EVEN BEFORE THE

12:39.859 --> 12:40.960
RECENT ATTACK ON THE KOSHER

12:40.960 --> 12:42.061
MARKET IN PARIS, ANTISEMITIC

12:42.061 --> 12:43.329
PROTESTS WERE INTENSIFYING.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.264
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF JEWISH

12:45.264 --> 12:46.799
STORE OWNERS WHO WERE FORCED TO

12:46.799 --> 12:48.167
LOCK THEMSELVES IN DURING ONE

12:48.167 --> 12:49.669
PROTEST, AFTER ISRAEL'S WAR WITH

12:49.669 --> 12:50.803
HAMAS LAST SUMMER IN GAZA.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.238
BETWEEN JANUARY AND JULY 2014,

12:52.238 --> 12:53.439
ACCORDING TO DATA GATHERED BY

12:53.439 --> 12:54.807
JEWISH GROUPS AND THE

12:54.807 --> 12:56.743
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, THE NUMBER OF

12:56.743 --> 12:58.444
ANTISEMITIC ACTS IN FRANCE

12:58.444 --> 12:59.879
NEARLY DOUBLED COMPARED TO THE

12:59.879 --> 13:01.314
SAME PERIOD IN 2013.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.049
THE SAME FIGURES SHOW HALF OF

13:03.049 --> 13:04.117
ALL RACIST ATTACKS IN FRANCE

13:04.117 --> 13:05.118
TARGET JEWS, EVEN THOUGH THEY

13:05.118 --> 13:06.552
NUMBER LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF

13:06.552 --> 13:10.456
THE POPULATION.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.091
AND YEARS AGO AT ANOTHER PROTEST

13:12.091 --> 13:13.793
IN PARIS, MUSLIMS DEMONSTRATED,

13:13.793 --> 13:15.595
CHANTING "KHAYBAR YAYAHUD,"

13:15.595 --> 13:17.030
WHICH MEANS THAT MOHAMMED'S ARMY

13:17.030 --> 13:19.999
WILL CRUSH THE JEWS AS THEY DID

13:19.999 --> 13:23.069
IN KHAYBAR IN THE SEVENTH

13:23.069 --> 13:28.641
CENTURY.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.344
RADICAL ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAD

13:31.344 --> 13:33.212
ATTACKED JEWS YEARS BEFORE THE

13:33.212 --> 13:35.048
RECENT KOSHER MARKET KIDNAPPINGS

13:35.048 --> 13:38.051
AND MURDERS.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.186
IN 2012, THAT BUILDUP OF HATRED

13:40.186 --> 13:42.021
AGAINST JEWS LED TO A BLOODY

13:42.021 --> 13:44.023
ONSLAUGHT PERPETRATED BY A

13:44.023 --> 13:46.392
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.761
MOHAMMED MERAH, A FRENCH RADICAL

13:48.761 --> 13:50.396
MUSLIM SHOT AND KILLED A RABBI,

13:50.396 --> 13:51.898
HIS TWO SMALL SONS, AND

13:51.898 --> 13:53.599
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL AT THE

13:53.599 --> 13:55.134
ENTRANCE OF A JEWISH SCHOOL IN

13:55.134 --> 13:57.070
TOULOUSE, A CITY ABOUT 420 MILES

13:57.070 --> 13:59.105
SOUTH OF PARIS.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.107
IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST

14:01.107 --> 14:03.276
ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS IN EUROPE

14:03.276 --> 14:06.312
SINCE WORLD WAR II.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.281
>> IF YOU COME TO A JEWISH

14:08.281 --> 14:10.550
SCHOOL AND YOU SHOOT A JEWISH

14:10.550 --> 14:12.151
CHILDREN ON HER HEAD, YOU

14:12.151 --> 14:14.654
CANNOT BE SOMETHING ELSE THAN AN

14:14.654 --> 14:16.589
EXTRAORDINARY ANTISEMITE.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.057
AND THE QUESTION OF ANTISEMITISM

14:18.057 --> 14:19.492
WAS SOMEHOW BLURRED BY THE IDEA

14:19.492 --> 14:20.760
THAT WE SHOULD NOT STIGMATIZE

14:20.760 --> 14:22.361
ANY POPULATION.

14:22.361 --> 14:28.301
>> Reporter: JEWISH LEADERS

14:28.301 --> 14:32.205
POINT OUT THE FRENCH MUSLIM

14:32.205 --> 14:34.073
COMMUNITY IS NOT AT WAR WITH

14:34.073 --> 14:37.510
FRENCH JEWRY AND THEY NOTE

14:37.510 --> 14:38.845
MUSLIM LEADERS CONDEMNED THE

14:38.845 --> 14:41.114
ATTACKS.

AND MY WIFE OVER ONCE, WHICH WAS

18:01.781 --> 18:07.119
QUITE A TRAUMATIC INCIDENT.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.388
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WHICH

18:09.388 --> 18:11.123

18:13.492 --> 18:16.462
IMMIGRANT BACKGROUNDS.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.998

18:21.901 --> 18:23.169
HOLOCAUST, IS STARTING TO FADE

18:23.169 --> 18:24.470
OUT.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.906
I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY NEW

18:26.906 --> 18:28.774
FORM OF ANTISEMITISM, I THINK

18:28.774 --> 18:30.376
IT'S A DIFFERENT FACE, A

18:30.376 --> 18:32.078
DIFFERENT COVER, BUT IT IS THE

18:32.078 --> 18:34.146
SAME OLD JEW HATRED.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.748
IF A PERSON'S HATE COULD TAKE

19:08.647 --> 19:09.849
POWERBALL JACKPOT HAS ALREADY

19:09.849 --> 19:10.950
SPIKED TO MORE THAN $450 MILLION

19:10.950 --> 19:11.851

NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.453
THE HUGE PRIZE IS EXPECTED TO

19:15.688 --> 19:16.922
TICKET BUYING HAS REPORTEDLY

19:16.922 --> 19:17.990
DROPPED 35% SINCE 2013, AND

19:17.990 --> 19:19.125
THAT'S PUTTING STATE BUDGETS ON

19:19.125 --> 19:20.393
THE LOSING END OF THE LOTTERY

19:20.393 --> 19:23.095
SYSTEM.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.463

19:24.463 --> 19:25.998
TO TALK ABOUT THE PITFALLS OF

POWERBALL IS BEN LEUBSDORF WITH

19:27.400 --> 19:31.570
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."

19:31.570 --> 19:33.005
>> SO BEN, HERE'S THE

19:33.005 --> 19:34.707
OBVIOUS QUESTION, WHY IS THE

19:34.707 --> 19:35.941
DECLINE IN PARTICIPATES?

19:35.941 --> 19:38.010
>> WELL, THIS IS THE BIGGEST

19:38.010 --> 19:40.279
JACKPOT WE'VE SEEN SINCE

19:40.279 --> 19:41.480
DECEMBER 2013 FOR ANY

19:41.480 --> 19:42.615
LOTTERY GAME.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.383
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE AREN'T

19:44.383 --> 19:45.684
BUYING TICKETS.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.386
PEOPLE BUY TICKETS, THEY GET

19:47.386 --> 19:48.621
OFFICE POOLS, PEOPLE COME

19:48.621 --> 19:50.089
OFF THE SIDELINES WHO

19:50.089 --> 19:51.624
WEREN'T REGULAR PLAYERS WHEN

19:51.624 --> 19:53.826
YOU HAVE A BIG EYE-POPPING

19:53.826 --> 19:54.994
JACKPOT LIKE THIS AND WE

19:54.994 --> 19:56.562
HAVEN'T HAD ONE IN A WHILE.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.731
THAT'S THE MAIN REASON THAT

19:58.731 --> 20:01.534
POWERBALL SALES DROP 35% IN

20:01.534 --> 20:03.235
2014 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.938
IN 2013, 2012, WE HAD THIS

20:05.938 --> 20:07.640
STRING OF REALLY BIG

20:07.640 --> 20:09.408
JACKPOTS FOR MEGAMILLIONS AN

20:09.408 --> 20:10.709
POWERBALL AND THAT GOT

20:10.709 --> 20:11.744
PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.079
NOW WHEN WE HAVEN'T HAD

20:13.079 --> 20:14.447
THOSE BIG NUMBERS, PEOPLE

20:14.447 --> 20:15.548
HAVEN'T BEEN AS IMPRESSED

20:15.548 --> 20:17.116
WITH AN $80 MILLION JACKPOT

20:17.116 --> 20:18.818
AS THEY ARE WITH SOMETHING

20:18.818 --> 20:20.186
ABOVE 200, ABOVE $300

20:20.186 --> 20:21.187
MILLION.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.588
>> EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THAT

20:22.588 --> 20:23.989
DIRECTLY RESULTS IN STATE

20:23.989 --> 20:25.691
BUDGETS HAVING A PROBLEM.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.893
>> WELL, 44 STATES RELY ON

20:27.893 --> 20:29.361
LOTTERY REVENUE AS PART OF

20:29.361 --> 20:31.464
THEIR REVENUE PICTURE.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.965
AND IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST

20:32.965 --> 20:34.233
PART OF THEIR REVENUE

20:34.233 --> 20:36.368
STRUCTURE, TAXES, FEDERAL

20:36.368 --> 20:37.703
GRANTS, THOSE ARE STILL THE

20:37.703 --> 20:38.370
BIG PARTS.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.106
BUT THEY RELY ON THIS MONEY

20:40.106 --> 20:41.440
IN ORDER TO IN MANY CASES

20:41.440 --> 20:43.142
PAY FOR EDUCATION OR OTHER

20:43.142 --> 20:43.809
EXPENSES.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.177
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BIG

20:45.177 --> 20:46.879
REDUCTION IN POWERFUL BALL

20:46.879 --> 20:48.514
PLAYING, YOU'VE GOT STATE

20:48.514 --> 20:50.049
LOTTERIES SAYING WE'VE GOT

20:50.049 --> 20:51.417
TO MAKE UP THAT REVENUE

20:51.417 --> 20:52.718
SOMEHOW, SO SOME STATES,

20:52.718 --> 20:54.420
VIRGINIA IN PARTICULAR HAS

20:54.420 --> 20:55.788
TWEAKED THEIR-- TO ROLL OUT

20:55.788 --> 20:57.523
MORE SCRATCH OUT GAMES,

20:57.523 --> 20:58.257
INSTANT WIN GAMES TO MAKE

20:58.257 --> 20:59.625
THAT UP LOST REVENUE TO MAKE

20:59.625 --> 21:00.893
SURE THEY DON'T HAVE A

21:00.893 --> 21:02.061
SHORTFALL WHEN IT COMES TO

21:02.061 --> 21:03.762
TIME TO SETTLE THEIR BUDGET.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.464
>> SO IF YOU CAN'T COUNT ON

21:05.464 --> 21:06.899
PARTICIPANTS IN THE LOTTERY,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.267
WHY DO STATES HAVE THIS AS

21:08.267 --> 21:10.202
PART OF THEIR BUDGET FOR POLIO?

21:10.202 --> 21:12.671
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, BY ITS

21:12.671 --> 21:14.707
NATURE A RANDOM CHANCE THAT

21:14.707 --> 21:16.075
THESE DRAWINGS ARE PRETTY

21:16.075 --> 21:16.475
RANDOM.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.344
SO WHEN WE HAD A HOT STREAK

21:18.344 --> 21:21.914
IN 2012, 2013, STATES WERE

21:21.914 --> 21:23.282
RAKING IN A LOT OF REVENUE.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.884
NOW WE'VE HAD A DRY STREAK

21:24.884 --> 21:25.651
FOR A WHILE.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.752
AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING

21:26.752 --> 21:27.486
IT.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.821
BUT I THINK MOST OFFICIALS

21:28.821 --> 21:30.222
AREN'T TOO WORRIED THAT THIS

21:30.222 --> 21:31.123
IS GOING TO CONTINUE.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.525
THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING

21:32.525 --> 21:33.792
OF ANOTHER STRING OF BIG

21:33.792 --> 21:34.393
JACKPOTS.

21:34.393 --> 21:35.661
>> IT HAS BEEN SERIOUS FOR

21:35.661 --> 21:36.862
CERTAIN STATES.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.030
ARKANSAS FOR EXAMPLE HAD ONE

21:38.030 --> 21:39.398
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT HAD

21:39.398 --> 21:40.766
A $5 MILLION DEFICIT.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.134
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

21:42.134 --> 21:43.502
STATES CAN DO TO PREVENT

21:43.502 --> 21:45.037
THIS FROM HAPPENING TO THEM?

21:45.037 --> 21:47.072
>> WELL, SOME STATES ARE

21:47.072 --> 21:48.574
VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR

21:48.574 --> 21:49.275
REVENUE ESTIMATES.

21:49.275 --> 21:50.509
I SPOKE TO THE HEAD OF THE

21:50.509 --> 21:52.044
NORTH CAROLINA LOTTERY WHO

21:52.044 --> 21:54.113
SAYS THAT THEY BUDGET

21:54.113 --> 21:55.047
FOR-- THEY ASSUME THAT

21:55.047 --> 21:56.315
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

21:56.315 --> 21:57.850
STANDARD NUMBER OF PLAYERS.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.251
THEY DON'T COUNT ON A BIG

21:59.251 --> 22:00.619
JACKPOT TO BRING IN LOTS OF

22:00.619 --> 22:03.055
NEW PLAYERS, IF THEY DOCK,

22:03.055 --> 22:04.757
SHE SAID, THAT'S GRAVY,

22:04.757 --> 22:05.424
THAT'S GREAT FOR THEM.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.592
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

22:06.592 --> 22:07.493
IN TROUBLE IF THEY DON'T

22:07.493 --> 22:09.028
HAVE BIG JACKPOTS

22:09.028 --> 22:10.296
MATERIALIZED.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.630
>> LEN LUBES DORF FROM THE

22:18.771 --> 22:27.680
SUNDAY.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.048
>> Stewart: FOR DECADES, TWO

22:29.048 --> 22:30.749
BRONZE SCULPTURES LANGUISHED IN

22:30.749 --> 22:31.850
DUSTY OBSCURITY IN THE CORNER OF

22:31.850 --> 22:33.953
A CAMBRIDGE MUSEUM.

22:33.953 --> 22:34.920
BEN CHAPMAN HAS THE STORY.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.388
>> THEIR MAGNIFICENCE HAS NEVER

22:36.388 --> 22:38.357
BEEN IN DOUBT.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.661
BUT FOR CENTURIES, THE

22:42.661 --> 22:44.096
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHO CREATED

22:44.096 --> 22:48.000
THEM HAS BEEN LOST.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.268
NOW REMOVED FROM OBSCURITY AND

22:49.268 --> 22:50.369
POLISHED UP FOR PUBLIC DISPLAY,

22:50.369 --> 22:53.072
THEY COULD BE TWO OF THE WORLD'S

22:53.072 --> 22:55.474
MOST SIGNIFICANT SCULPTURES.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.575
>> MICHELANGELO WAS ONE OF

22:56.575 --> 22:57.743
THE GREATEST IF NOT THE

22:57.743 --> 22:58.944
GREATEST SCULPTURES EVER TO

22:58.944 --> 22:59.945
HAVE LIVERED AND WE KNOW

22:59.945 --> 23:01.247
THAT HE MADE WORKS IN BRONZE

23:01.247 --> 23:02.681
BUT NONE OF THEM APPEAR TO

23:02.681 --> 23:03.349
HAVE SURVIVED.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.117
THERE ARE TWO, NOT ONE BUT

23:05.117 --> 23:06.819
TWO, THERE IS A BIG GAP IN

23:06.819 --> 23:08.254
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HIS

23:08.254 --> 23:08.754
GENIUS.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.656
>> THE MYSTERY OF THE

23:10.656 --> 23:12.057
CONSUME TURE BEGAN TO

23:12.057 --> 23:15.561
UNRAVEL WHEN RESEARCHERS SAW

23:15.561 --> 23:18.731
THIS COPY A SKETCH BY ONE

23:18.731 --> 23:20.599
OF HIS APPRENTICES SHOWING A

23:20.599 --> 23:22.201
PANTHER AND ITS RIDER.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.169
THEY FOUND THE STYLE MATCHED

23:24.169 --> 23:26.038
HIS WORK OTHER WORK

23:26.038 --> 23:28.674
INCLUDING THE SISTINE CHAPEL

23:28.674 --> 23:29.341
COMPLETED AROUND THE SAME

23:29.341 --> 23:29.742
TIME.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.377
BUT THE GREATEST TEST MAY BE

23:31.377 --> 23:32.478
YET TO COME AS THE PUBLIC

23:32.478 --> 23:33.812
AND THE ART WORLD ARE

23:33.812 --> 23:35.714
INVITED TO ADMIRE AND POUR

23:35.714 --> 23:38.651
OVER THESE SKUPT TURES, LOOK

23:38.651 --> 23:39.685
AT THE EVIDENCE AND DECIDE

23:39.685 --> 23:40.686
FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY

23:40.686 --> 23:42.154
REALLY ARE MICHELANGELO'S

23:42.154 --> 23:42.755
WORK.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.756
>> WHY DID IT MATTER?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.458
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE

23:46.458 --> 23:48.527
BRONZES ARE MAGNIFICENT

23:48.527 --> 23:48.861
THINGS.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.896
THEY WERE DESERVED-- WE'RE

23:50.896 --> 23:52.331
CURIOUS, WE'RE INQUISITIVE,

23:52.331 --> 23:53.365
WE WANT TO KNOW WHO MADE

23:53.365 --> 23:54.700
THEM AND WHY, YOU KNOW, WHAT

23:54.700 --> 23:56.001
THEY ARE USED FOR.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.403
>> FOR ART HISTORIANS THAT

23:57.403 --> 23:59.271
INFORMATION IS INVALUABLE.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.407
FOR THE OWNER OF THESE

24:01.407 --> 24:02.708
SCULPTURES HE WILL FIND OUT

24:02.708 --> 24:04.176
FOR SURE IF THEY ARE TO BE

24:04.176 --> 24:05.311
ATTRIBUTED OFFICIALLY TO

24:05.311 --> 24:06.712
MICHELANGELO IN THE SUMMER,

24:06.712 --> 24:09.014
IT REALLY IS PRICELESS.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.215
>> BEN CHAPMAN,

24:10.215 --> 24:11.550
CIRCUMSTANCES TV NEWS,

24:11.550 --> 24:22.528

24:22.528 --> 24:25.197
>> FINALLY TONIGHT, THE

24:25.197 --> 24:27.299
GREECE IS LAYING OUT A PLAN

24:27.299 --> 24:28.300
TO PULL HIS COUNTRY OUT OF

24:28.300 --> 24:29.068
DEBT.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.035
THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED

24:30.035 --> 24:31.103
TODAY HE WANTS TO

24:31.103 --> 24:32.304
RENEGOTIATE THE COUNTRY'S

24:32.304 --> 24:33.505
MASSIVE DEBT DEAL.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.174
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND

24:35.174 --> 24:36.208
OFFER FREE ELECTRICITY TO

24:36.208 --> 24:37.242
THE POOREST CITIZENS.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.278
BUT EU LEADERS WANT HIM TO

24:39.278 --> 24:40.679
STEP UP AUSTERITY MEASURES

24:40.679 --> 24:42.848
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RECENT

24:42.848 --> 24:44.783
240 BILLION EURO BAILOUT.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.719
THE U.S. IS URGING THE EUROZONE

24:46.719 --> 24:48.854
LEADERS TO COMPROMISE.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.389
THAT IS IT FOR THIS EDITION
