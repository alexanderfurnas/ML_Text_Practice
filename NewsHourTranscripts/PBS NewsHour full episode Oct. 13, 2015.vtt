WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:09.843
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.843 --> 00:15.082
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Investigators conclude a
Russian-made missile took down
the Malaysia

00:15.082 --> 00:18.452
Airlines flight over
Ukraine last year.

00:18.452 --> 00:24.057
Then: Democrats running for
president get their first crack
at the debate stage tonight.

00:24.057 --> 00:28.896
Plus, our series called Congo's
hope continues, with a look at
how cinema can help heal the

00:28.896 --> 00:31.031
wounds of war.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.533
CHERIE RIVERS NDALIKO, Executive
Director, Yole!Africa: It's
incredible to see what happens

00:33.533 --> 00:35.402
when they learn that they can
tell their own story, and in
their version of the story,

00:35.402 --> 00:38.238
they can be the hero.

00:38.238 --> 00:43.410
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the last of
the president's men. I talk with
Bob Woodward and Alexander

00:43.410 --> 00:48.115
Butterfield about the new book
that reveals new dimensions of
Richard Nixon's personality

00:48.115 --> 00:50.250
and his obsession with secrecy.

00:50.250 --> 00:57.457
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.457 --> 01:01.995
(BREAK)

01:01.995 --> 01:12.506
JUDY WOODRUFF: Palestinians
proclaimed today a day of rage
after nearly a month of
escalating

01:12.506 --> 01:18.478
violence. Three Israeli
civilians died in a string of
stabbing attacks, along with
three

01:18.478 --> 01:22.049
Palestinians, including two of
the attackers. In response,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

01:22.049 --> 01:27.054
Netanyahu called an
emergency Cabinet meeting.

01:27.054 --> 01:33.360
There is word that U.S. and
Russian jets flew within miles
of each other over Syria on
Saturday.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.065
The Pentagon reported the
incident today in a video
briefing. Russian airstrikes
have

01:38.065 --> 01:42.402
been hammering targets across
Syria. A U.S. military spokesman
says the close encounter

01:42.402 --> 01:44.738
underscores the risk.

01:44.738 --> 01:48.475
COL. STEVE WARREN, U.S. Army: It
is dangerous, right? I mean,
it's dangerous if two sets

01:48.475 --> 01:55.115
of aircraft come into the same
piece of airspace without very
clear, laid-out protocols for

01:55.115 --> 01:59.720
safety of all involved, which is
why we have sat down with the
Russians to establish some

01:59.720 --> 02:01.588
safety protocols.

02:01.588 --> 02:06.860
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, at a
Moscow event, President Vladimir
Putin blamed Washington

02:06.860 --> 02:11.131
for a lack of coordination on
the competing air campaigns.

02:11.131 --> 02:17.137
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
We asked the U.S. on the
military

02:17.137 --> 02:20.374
level to give us the targets
which they consider to be the
terrorist ones. But the answer
was,

02:20.374 --> 02:23.510
no, we are not ready to do that.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.013
Then we thought and asked
another question. Could you tell
us where we shouldn't hit?

02:26.013 --> 02:29.983
Again, no answer. So,
what should we do?

02:29.983 --> 02:35.489
JUDY WOODRUFF: The next round of
talks between the U.S. and
Russian militaries will be
tomorrow.

02:35.489 --> 02:40.594
Meanwhile, the Islamic State
called today for Muslims to
launch a holy war against both

02:40.594 --> 02:45.399
countries. The appeal was in an
audio message posted online.

02:45.399 --> 02:50.604
In Afghanistan, the Taliban
announced it's pulling back from
Kunduz, the city in the

02:50.604 --> 02:56.410
north, to avoid further civilian
casualties. Taliban fighters
held Kunduz for three days

02:56.410 --> 03:01.915
last month, and the fierce
fighting forced thousands of
people to flee. Now fighting

03:01.915 --> 03:08.255
has shifted south to Ghazni, a
city that lies along the main
highway between Kabul and
Kandahar.

03:08.255 --> 03:13.960
Iran's Parliament voted today to
approve a nuclear deal with the
U.S. and other world

03:13.960 --> 03:20.567
powers. It came after rowdy
debate and objections from
hard-liners, who argued the deal
concedes

03:20.567 --> 03:26.373
too much to the West. Now the
bill goes to the Guardian
Council of 12 clerics for
ratification.

03:26.373 --> 03:31.678
The stance of Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is still
unknown. He has the final

03:31.678 --> 03:36.316
say on all matters of state.

03:36.316 --> 03:42.189
The world's top two beer makers
are joining forces.
Anheuser-Busch InBev sealed a
deal

03:42.189 --> 03:49.463
today to buy SABMiller for $106
billion. In a company video, the
head of A.B. InBev said

03:49.463 --> 03:52.365
it's all about consumer choice.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.068
CARLOS BRITO, CEO,
Anheuser-Busch InBev: Our joint
portfolio of global and local
brands

03:55.068 --> 04:00.774
would provide more choices for
beer drinkers in new and
existing markets around the
world.

04:00.774 --> 04:05.345
Consumers would have more
opportunities to taste a wide
range of beers, ranging from

04:05.345 --> 04:10.784
specialty and craft beers to
local champions and global
flagship brands.

04:10.784 --> 04:15.689
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new company
will control about a third of
the global beer market. But

04:15.689 --> 04:19.092
the sheer size of the deal could
run into resistance from
regulators, especially in

04:19.092 --> 04:22.729
the U.S. and China.

04:22.729 --> 04:27.701
And Wall Street had a down day
after China reported that its
imports fell 20 percent

04:27.701 --> 04:32.706
last month over a year ago. The
Dow Jones industrial average
lost 50 points to close

04:32.706 --> 04:40.914
back near 17080. The Nasdaq fell
42 points and the S&P 500
dropped 13.

04:40.914 --> 04:45.819
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
digging into the evidence of
what shot down the Malaysian

04:45.819 --> 04:52.792
passenger plane over Ukraine;
how a possible Joe Biden run
could influence tonight's
Democratic

04:52.792 --> 04:57.430
debate; a new book reveals
untold dimensions of President
Nixon's White House, and much

04:57.430 --> 05:05.539
more.

05:05.539 --> 05:16.816
A 15-month-long investigation
into what brought down Malaysia
Airlines Flight 17 last year

05:16.816 --> 05:22.756
is over. And, as most expected,
it concluded a missile targeted
the plane. The airliner

05:22.756 --> 05:28.595
was traveling from Amsterdam to
Kuala Lumpur when it was struck
over Eastern Ukraine. No

05:28.595 --> 05:36.002
one has taken responsibility,
but today's report set sharpened
suspicions and denials.

05:36.002 --> 05:42.275
Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the
pieced-together wreckage of the
plane's front fuselage loomed

05:42.275 --> 05:46.680
over the chairman of the Dutch
Safety Board, as he announced
the findings:

05:46.680 --> 05:50.750
TJIBBE JOUSTRA, Dutch Safety
Board Chairman: Flight MH17
crashed as a result of the
detonation

05:50.750 --> 05:56.156
of a warhead outside the
airplane, above the left-hand
side of the cockpit.

05:56.156 --> 06:01.962
JUDY WOODRUFF: In short, as this
Dutch animation depicts, a
Russian-built missile,
identified

06:01.962 --> 06:09.703
by shrapnel and paint, blew the
Malaysian airliner apart on July
17 last year. The report

06:09.703 --> 06:13.873
says the missile exploded less
than a meter from the cockpit,
spraying metal fragments

06:13.873 --> 06:16.776
into the plane.

06:16.776 --> 06:24.517
All 298 people on board were
killed, as wreckage, luggage and
bodies rained down over Eastern

06:24.517 --> 06:30.090
Ukraine. Investigators say some
passengers might have stayed
alive for a minute or so

06:30.090 --> 06:36.563
after impact, but were too dazed
by shock, cold and loss of
oxygen to know what was
happening.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.666
Barry Sweeney's son was
one of those who died.

06:39.666 --> 06:44.971
BARRY SWEENEY, Father of Victim:
But because of the impact of the
missile, the explosion,

06:44.971 --> 06:49.175
the confusion and everything
else, it sounds as though
everybody died peacefully. And
that's

06:49.175 --> 06:54.614
comforting me, and I would think
all other families of Flight
MH17.

06:54.614 --> 07:00.654
JUDY WOODRUFF: The investigation
also plotted simulated flight
paths and concluded the missile

07:00.654 --> 07:07.027
was launched from a
124-square-mile region.
Russian-backed separatists
controlled that

07:07.027 --> 07:13.133
area, but the report doesn't
address who fired the weapon.
Still, the Russian state arms

07:13.133 --> 07:18.405
producer that makes the BUK
missile disputed those findings.
It said its own experiments

07:18.405 --> 07:22.042
prove a much older missile
took down the plane.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.711
YAN NOVIKOV, General Director,
Almaz-Antey (through
translator): The general
engineer

07:24.711 --> 07:30.250
of missile 9M38 decided that the
safety period for using this
missile, including all
extensions,

07:30.250 --> 07:34.688
is 25 years. The use of these
missiles was prohibited after
that, and they were retired

07:34.688 --> 07:37.090
from the Russian army.

07:37.090 --> 07:42.162
JUDY WOODRUFF: The arms
manufacturer said that kind of
missile is still used by
Ukraine's

07:42.162 --> 07:47.834
military and that, in fact, it
was launched from
Ukrainian-controlled territory.
Either

07:47.834 --> 07:51.604
way, the Dutch investigators
said today the plane never
should have been in that
airspace

07:51.604 --> 07:54.040
to begin with.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.712
TJIBBE JOUSTRA: Ukraine's
position is that there was
insufficient reason for closing

07:58.712 --> 08:04.884
the airspace above the eastern
part of the country. We have,
however, concluded that,

08:04.884 --> 08:09.756
as a precaution, there was
sufficient reason for Ukraine
authorities to close the
airspace

08:09.756 --> 08:12.459
above the eastern part
of their country.

08:12.459 --> 08:16.730
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Dutch
prosecutors say unnamed persons
of interest have been

08:16.730 --> 08:21.901
identified in a criminal
investigation that is
continuing.

08:21.901 --> 08:26.573
We look at some of the details
of today's findings with a
longtime investigator. Peter

08:26.573 --> 08:31.878
Goelz is a former managing
director of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board.

08:31.878 --> 08:37.384
He oversaw the investigation,
among others, of TWA Flight 800
that crashed off Long Island

08:37.384 --> 08:41.388
almost 20 years ago and
speculation then of whether a
missile brought it down.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.824
Peter Goelz, welcome
back to the program.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.294
How good a job did this
international team do, do you
think, of piecing together what

08:48.294 --> 08:50.363
caused this crash?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.598
PETER GOELZ, Former Managing
Director, National
Transportation Safety Board: I
think they

08:51.598 --> 08:56.369
did an extraordinary job. I read
the report late last night and
this morning. It's almost

08:56.369 --> 09:02.609
300 pages in length. It is
detailed. It is factual. And
it's very sober.

09:02.609 --> 09:08.314
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, among other
things, I'm struck by how it
describes pieces of shrapnel

09:08.314 --> 09:14.587
from this missile, paint from
the missile embedded in the
bodies of the crew and people

09:14.587 --> 09:18.625
who were sitting in the front of
the plane. Does it leave any
doubt of the kind of missile

09:18.625 --> 09:23.496
that hit right at the -- what
they said, a meter from the
plane?

09:23.496 --> 09:27.801
PETER GOELZ: Yes, no, there's no
doubt about the type of missile
or where it struck.

09:27.801 --> 09:35.809
I mean, when a missile detonates
in that proximity to the
aircraft, it leaves very
distinctive

09:35.809 --> 09:41.214
marks, as you can see, on the
nose of the aircraft. And these
holes, these hundreds

09:41.214 --> 09:47.487
of holes, they have microscopic
bits of the metal, of the piece
of shrapnel sometimes

09:47.487 --> 09:51.825
in the hole. And you can
trace it back to the source.

09:51.825 --> 10:00.400
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we heard the
Dutch investigator call it the
9N314 missile. What does it tell

10:00.400 --> 10:06.406
you, Peter Goelz, that is a
missile that blew up just
outside the plane? It didn't hit
the

10:06.406 --> 10:09.375
plane. It blew up before
it struck the plane.

10:09.375 --> 10:14.948
PETER GOELZ: Now, the more
recent missiles have what they
call proximity fuses. And they

10:14.948 --> 10:20.386
are driven by radar. It senses
when they're in close proximity
to their target and they

10:20.386 --> 10:27.460
explode and dispersing the
shrapnel in a very defined way.

10:27.460 --> 10:36.769
We did tests in 1997 at the
China Lake Missile Center in
which the U.S., we detonated
warheads

10:36.769 --> 10:43.176
near pieces of aircraft skin,
the metal, the aluminum. And we
saw the very distinctive

10:43.176 --> 10:47.981
patterns that they left. So the
investigators knew what they
were looking for and knew what

10:47.981 --> 10:50.450
they had when they found it.

10:50.450 --> 10:55.688
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is possible to
say one side or another would
have had this kind of missile?

10:55.688 --> 10:59.192
We know the Russians are saying,
no, we don't have this missile
in our arsenal anymore;

10:59.192 --> 11:02.095
the Ukrainians were using this.

11:02.095 --> 11:08.101
PETER GOELZ: Well, I think that
the investigators that I have
spoken to who were involved in

11:08.101 --> 11:16.276
this time-consuming effort have
indicated that there is other
information available

11:16.276 --> 11:21.214
from intelligence sources that
indicate where this missile was
launched from, and that it's

11:21.214 --> 11:25.952
very clear that it was well
inside the separatist territory.

11:25.952 --> 11:30.423
JUDY WOODRUFF: So is it
possible, do you think it will
eventually be possible to say
this

11:30.423 --> 11:33.192
was the source, this is
who fired that missile?

11:33.192 --> 11:36.663
PETER GOELZ: Yes, I think
the truth comes out.

11:36.663 --> 11:44.470
After KAL 007 was shot down off
the Soviet Union, it took years,
and it took years of

11:44.470 --> 11:50.109
activism on the part of family
members, but eventually the
Russians admitted what happened.

11:50.109 --> 11:54.414
I think it will take time, but
the truth will come out in this
case as well.

11:54.414 --> 11:58.217
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one other
thing, the discussion today
about whether this plane,
passenger

11:58.217 --> 12:02.255
plane should have been flying
over an area of conflict?

12:02.255 --> 12:06.826
PETER GOELZ: That is probably
the most important
recommendation that the Dutch
made. You know,

12:06.826 --> 12:11.698
that day, there had been almost
150 aircraft traveling along
that airway, the same one

12:11.698 --> 12:12.231
that Malaysia...

12:12.231 --> 12:13.633
JUDY WOODRUFF: Passenger planes.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.903
PETER GOELZ: That's right.
These are passengers planes.

12:16.903 --> 12:22.175
And what they said was that
there was very poor coordination
between the civil aviation

12:22.175 --> 12:27.814
authorities and the government,
and the governments at play, and
that they probably shouldn't

12:27.814 --> 12:33.553
have been there in that area of
conflict, because planes at
lower altitudes, mind you,

12:33.553 --> 12:39.225
had been being shot down, that
greater attention has to be paid
to the safety of the airways.

12:39.225 --> 12:43.096
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Goelz,
we thank you very much.

12:43.096 --> 12:53.973
PETER GOELZ: Thank you.

12:53.973 --> 13:02.715
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will hear a
great deal from the five
Democrats vying to be president
tonight,

13:02.715 --> 13:07.186
as they take to the debate stage
for the first time in this
campaign.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.757
But hovering over them are
questions about a potential
sixth candidate, Vice President

13:10.757 --> 13:13.726
Joe Biden.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.696
Some Democrats are getting
impatient and say it's time for
him to decide whether or not

13:16.696 --> 13:18.998
he's going to run.

13:18.998 --> 13:22.568
The "NewsHour"'s political
director, Lisa Desjardins,
reports from Las Vegas on the

13:22.568 --> 13:24.570
Biden factor.

13:24.570 --> 13:28.975
LISA DESJARDINS: The man
not on stage tonight...

13:28.975 --> 13:30.376
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: I'm Joe
Biden. I'm Jill's husband.

13:30.376 --> 13:35.014
LISA DESJARDINS: ... has had
plenty to stay this month. Going
off script at a Hispanic

13:35.014 --> 13:39.452
heritage event, he took aim at
Donald Trump and Republicans on
immigration.

13:39.452 --> 13:43.923
JOSEPH BIDEN: Trump and that
stuff you're hearing on the
other team, and not just -- this

13:43.923 --> 13:48.428
isn't about Democrat/Republican.
It's about a sick message.

13:48.428 --> 13:53.066
LISA DESJARDINS: With union
workers on Labor Day, he went
after tax breaks for the rich.

13:53.066 --> 13:59.472
JOSEPH BIDEN: Why in God's name
should a man or woman working in
a steel mill making $50,000

13:59.472 --> 14:02.942
a year pay at a higher rate than
someone who makes tens of
millions of dollars on Wall

14:02.942 --> 14:04.477
Street?

14:04.477 --> 14:07.947
LISA DESJARDINS: And at a solar
convention, it was climate.

14:07.947 --> 14:13.152
JOSEPH BIDEN: Make no mistake
about it, folks, climate change
is caused by human endeavors,

14:13.152 --> 14:20.259
and it's an existential threat.
What's at stake is whether we
have a future at all.

14:20.259 --> 14:26.232
LISA DESJARDINS: The topics and
tone of a candidate, they are
from a man on pause. Biden,

14:26.232 --> 14:30.670
who has been mourning the death
of his son Beau, told "The Late
Show"'s Stephen Colbert

14:30.670 --> 14:33.840
he's not sure he has the heart
to run for the White House
again.

14:33.840 --> 14:40.246
JOSEPH BIDEN: I would be lying
if I said that I knew I was
there.

14:40.246 --> 14:44.183
LISA DESJARDINS: As Biden
carefully considers whether to
enter the race, Democratic
voters

14:44.183 --> 14:49.155
and funders will be focused on
the debate stage here in Las
Vegas tonight and the declared

14:49.155 --> 14:52.525
candidates, and some political
experts say Biden's window to
jump in the race may be

14:52.525 --> 14:54.393
finite.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.863
HILARY ROSEN, Democratic
Strategist: He doesn't have a
long time. But he's got several
weeks

14:56.863 --> 14:58.064
more.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.900
LISA DESJARDINS: Hilary Rosen
is a Democratic strategist.

15:00.900 --> 15:05.438
HILARY ROSEN: There are some
filing deadlines I think coming
up next month that he has to

15:05.438 --> 15:10.777
deal with. But we're going to
have a debate a month for the
next six months. He's got

15:10.777 --> 15:13.045
to get in.

15:13.045 --> 15:17.950
LISA DESJARDINS: What would it
mean if Biden gets in? Here's a
look at how those on stage

15:17.950 --> 15:22.388
tonight did in the latest
national NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll without Biden. It's a

15:22.388 --> 15:25.725
race between Clinton
and Sanders.

15:25.725 --> 15:32.131
But, hypothetically, beam Biden
into the mix, and he would get
nearly one in five Democratic

15:32.131 --> 15:37.603
votes, taking some from Sanders,
but the biggest chunk would come
from camp Clinton. At the

15:37.603 --> 15:42.441
same time, Clinton faces
dropping favorability ratings,
meaning a debate without Biden
is

15:42.441 --> 15:45.344
a key opportunity for her.

15:45.344 --> 15:50.483
HILARY ROSEN: If Hillary does
really, really well and
Democrats end up rallying around

15:50.483 --> 15:55.154
her, you know, that might take
some of the air out of the Biden
balloon. And so there's

15:55.154 --> 15:56.589
a lot of pressure on Hillary.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.625
JOSEPH BIDEN: Things can
change in a heartbeat.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.129
LISA DESJARDINS: Adding to the
pressure on the race is the
super PAC Draft Biden.

16:03.129 --> 16:08.367
JOSEPH BIDEN: Six weeks after
the election, my hole world was
altered forever.

16:08.367 --> 16:13.439
LISA DESJARDINS: The group
created this emotional ad
stressing how Biden coped with
the death

16:13.439 --> 16:20.446
of his wife, daughter and now
son. Biden publicly asked the
group not to run it, and they
complied.

16:20.446 --> 16:25.618
It's part of the warm sentiment
and high favorabilities around
Biden right now, but that could
change,

16:25.618 --> 16:28.421
warns Democratic strategist
Rodell Mollineau.

16:28.421 --> 16:32.158
RODELL MOLLINEAU, Democratic
Strategist: Primary voters love
what they can't have. There's

16:32.158 --> 16:36.329
always the what if. What if this
person were to run or this
person were to run? And I think

16:36.329 --> 16:39.632
you're getting that right now
with Vice President Biden. I
think that it's a lot different,

16:39.632 --> 16:42.568
though, once you become
a declared candidate.

16:42.568 --> 16:47.707
LISA DESJARDINS: Mollineau
points to Biden's work on the
1994 crime bill, now criticized

16:47.707 --> 16:53.012
as propelling overincarceration.
In addition, Biden supports the
Trans-Pacific Partnership

16:53.012 --> 16:58.451
trade deal, unpopular with many
Democrats and opposed by Clinton
and Sanders.

16:58.451 --> 17:06.025
And, finally, with 36 years in
the Senate, Biden is an insider
in a year of the outsider.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.463
The vice president has indicated
it all comes down to a personal
decision, but some think

17:10.463 --> 17:13.699
tonight's debate might matter.

17:13.699 --> 17:18.037
RODELL MOLLINEAU: Should Vice
President Biden or his
consultants see a debate where
none

17:18.037 --> 17:21.774
of the candidates are truly
resonating with the voters or
the audience, that might be

17:21.774 --> 17:26.312
something that factors into his
decision as to whether or not he
runs.

17:26.312 --> 17:31.384
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us
now with the latest from the
Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.185
the site of tonight's debate.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.655
Lisa, welcome.

17:35.655 --> 17:40.459
So, Vice President Biden is not
there. You have been talking to
a lot of people. What

17:40.459 --> 17:43.829
are they saying about the two
front-runners and what they need
to do tonight? What is

17:43.829 --> 17:47.266
their strategy, Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders?

17:47.266 --> 17:50.636
LISA DESJARDINS: I
think that's right.

17:50.636 --> 17:56.275
Most people are looking for that
matchup tonight in particular.
Let's start with Bernie Sanders.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.378
We know from his campaign -- I
just talked to his campaign
spokeswoman, Simone Sanders,

17:59.378 --> 18:02.281
no relation. And she says that
he will not go on the attack,
that he's always stayed

18:02.281 --> 18:04.283
positive.

18:04.283 --> 18:08.587
However, Judy, it's just what
that means, because they are
saying that he will give

18:08.587 --> 18:13.759
differentiate himself from
Hillary Clinton. Expect him in
particular to talk about trade,

18:13.759 --> 18:16.562
and that is going to come back
to that interview that you had
with Hillary Clinton in which

18:16.562 --> 18:19.999
she announced that she opposes
the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

18:19.999 --> 18:24.670
Bernie Sanders, we expect, to
talk about his consistency,
point out that this is a
relatively

18:24.670 --> 18:30.576
new position for Hillary
Clinton. And Hillary Clinton,
her campaign is saying they want

18:30.576 --> 18:34.914
her to stay on message and also
stay positive, but same thing
here, Judy. Expect her to
differentiate

18:34.914 --> 18:38.584
herself, especially
on the issue of guns.

18:38.584 --> 18:42.455
Now, we can talk about the
debate stage, but the truth is,
Judy, the fight between these

18:42.455 --> 18:48.127
two Democrats has already
started in Las Vegas over
unions. Here, you see Hillary
Clinton

18:48.127 --> 18:53.899
yesterday speaking at a protest
of culinary workers. That is the
largest union in Nevada,

18:53.899 --> 18:56.736
and it's a group that
has not endorsed yet.

18:56.736 --> 19:01.374
They endorsed Barack Obama in
2008. Hillary Clinton certainly
wants them this time, and

19:01.374 --> 19:05.077
she showed that yesterday. It is
a very tense fight over unions.
Expect a lot of talk about

19:05.077 --> 19:07.513
workers tonight in the debate.

19:07.513 --> 19:12.418
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, being
a huge part of the Democratic
base, the labor unions.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.855
Let's talk about some of the
other candidates on the stage.
We haven't heard a great deal,

19:15.855 --> 19:21.560
Lisa, about the former governor
of Maryland, Martin O'Malley.
He's been trying to get his

19:21.560 --> 19:26.065
voice heard. But it's been tough
in this campaign. What are we
looking for from him?

19:26.065 --> 19:31.437
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
He may be the one with the most
at stake tonight, Judy.

19:31.437 --> 19:36.742
Martin O'Malley in some polls is
under 1 percent, just barely
above zero. And that's something

19:36.742 --> 19:40.913
that I don't think anyone
expected a few months ago. He
has a lengthy resume. He's
personable.

19:40.913 --> 19:45.851
He's a good campaigner, but he
just hasn't taken hold. Judy,
tonight, we expect, if anyone

19:45.851 --> 19:49.755
goes on the attack, it will be
Martin O'Malley. He will try the
look as though he is more

19:49.755 --> 19:52.858
of a progressive than
Hillary Clinton.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.396
And, as I say, the stakes are
very high, Judy, so high that,
in fact, if he doesn't improve

19:57.396 --> 20:02.368
in the polling, Judy, he may not
make future debates because of a
1 percent or higher cutoff

20:02.368 --> 20:04.737
established by
different networks.

20:04.737 --> 20:09.275
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, Lisa,
the other two on the stage are
candidates we frankly hear

20:09.275 --> 20:14.814
even less about. And that's the
former Senator from Virginia Jim
Webb and the former Senator

20:14.814 --> 20:18.350
and Governor of the state of
Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.252
What are their campaigns saying
about what they need to do
tonight?

20:20.252 --> 20:23.122
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

20:23.122 --> 20:28.928
Both of them are stressing the
homespun nature of their
campaigns. Part of that is, they

20:28.928 --> 20:34.133
are more low-funded campaigns.
They say they're proud of that.
For example, with Jim Webb,

20:34.133 --> 20:38.370
talking to his folks, we know
that those who will be speaking
for Mr. Webb here in the

20:38.370 --> 20:42.274
spin room are just friends of
his, who -- some of them friends
of his through the military

20:42.274 --> 20:46.178
and his experience there, but
people who have never been in a
spin room before.

20:46.178 --> 20:50.749
I think those two men in a way
have nothing to lose, and so we
should expect to see if

20:50.749 --> 20:55.921
one of them has an unexpectedly
strong moment tonight. I think
one thing overall for all

20:55.921 --> 21:00.759
of these candidates is, this
debate is especially important
because it's the first in a long

21:00.759 --> 21:04.396
season. And if our viewers will
remember, in 2008, by this
point, there were already

21:04.396 --> 21:06.665
13 debates.

21:06.665 --> 21:11.137
Can you imagine? It's sort of
hard to understand, but this
being the first at this start of

21:11.137 --> 21:13.572
the cycle, it's very important.

21:13.572 --> 21:18.544
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very
quickly, Lisa, difference
between a Republican debate and
a Democratic

21:18.544 --> 21:21.147
debate? You have covered both of
them now. What does it look
like? What does it feel

21:21.147 --> 21:22.181
like?

21:22.181 --> 21:26.051
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a
vast difference, Judy.

21:26.051 --> 21:30.689
I think, tonight, we think,
because there are fewer
candidates, and, to be honest,
because

21:30.689 --> 21:35.394
their disagreements are a bit
more nuanced, we think we might
have a more serious policy

21:35.394 --> 21:39.798
debate. A lot of us love those,
and hopefully we will get one
tonight. We will see.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.868
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
our political director, I know
you will be there and we

21:42.868 --> 21:44.170
will be talking to you
tomorrow all about it.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.237
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.706
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

21:47.706 --> 21:54.446
LISA DESJARDINS: Great.

21:54.446 --> 22:02.388
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to part
two of our series Congo's Hope.

22:02.388 --> 22:07.092
Most of us take for granted the
chance to catch a movie at the
local theater. Tonight,

22:07.092 --> 22:11.797
we bring you the story of one
man's attempt to bring cinema
back to the Democratic Republic

22:11.797 --> 22:16.302
of Congo, a place that has
seen so much destroyed by war.

22:16.302 --> 22:21.106
"PBS NewsHour" contributing
editor Soledad O'Brien reports.

22:21.106 --> 22:26.779
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Cinema Virunga
is just another shell of a
building on another unpaved
street

22:26.779 --> 22:29.882
in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.651
PETNA NDALIKO, Filmmaker: Here
is where we used to buy our
tickets from.

22:32.651 --> 22:33.252
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Oh, this
is the ticket booth?

22:33.252 --> 22:33.752
PETNA NDALIKO: Yes.

22:33.752 --> 22:34.954
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Oh.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.155
PETNA NDALIKO: Yes. But
now it's the main entry.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.856
(LAUGHTER)

22:37.856 --> 22:42.061
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Yet filmmaker
Petna Ndaliko still sees
something special behind these

22:42.061 --> 22:45.965
rusty gates. He remembers the
time he snuck in as a boy.

22:45.965 --> 22:50.703
Do you remember the first time
you came to watch a film?

22:50.703 --> 22:54.106
PETNA NDALIKO: Oh, yes, I
remember. I was still young. And
I got in illegally. I wasn't

22:54.106 --> 22:56.475
even supposed to be in
here to watch that film.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.844
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
What was the movie?

22:58.844 --> 23:04.416
PETNA NDALIKO: The film was
"Black Jim Le Magnifique." It
was a film about kung fu.

23:04.416 --> 23:10.789
The main character was a black
guy, and it was so good for me
to see a film where a black

23:10.789 --> 23:14.226
guy was the main character, and
it was like -- yes, he was,
like, kicking everybody.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.961
(LAUGHTER)

23:15.961 --> 23:21.000
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Cinema Virunga
was a rare sight, the only
modern theater for hundreds

23:21.000 --> 23:28.574
of miles. It had opened in 1955,
when Congo was a Belgian colony,
to serve the booming

23:28.574 --> 23:35.681
population of Goma, a city in
the shadow of a volcano that
beckoned tourists.

23:35.681 --> 23:41.854
Inspired by Cinema Virunga,
Ndaliko became a filmmaker. Yet,
by the 1990s, Cinema Virunga

23:41.854 --> 23:47.693
itself was no more. The Rwandan
genocide had forced a million
refugees into Goma, and the

23:47.693 --> 23:51.263
cinema became refugee housing.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.234
After the crisis, a series of
civil wars kept it closed.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.037
What's lost when you
don't have cinema?

23:58.037 --> 24:05.511
PETNA NDALIKO: Not having a
cinema, it is missing that
moment of a wow, that wow,
dream,

24:05.511 --> 24:12.318
and start dreaming big, being
capable of imagining things from
just your room and then come up

24:12.318 --> 24:16.889
with this crazy, beautiful idea,
and that's -- that is what
cinema brings to people.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.694
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Now Ndaliko
wants to bring that wow moment
back to the Congo.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.828
PETNA NDALIKO: Doing well.

24:22.828 --> 24:23.595
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: It
needs a little work.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.464
PETNA NDALIKO: Yes.

24:25.464 --> 24:30.469
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The building
briefly housed a nightclub, then
government offices, now

24:30.469 --> 24:37.810
storage. Ndaliko has raised just
$30,000 of the $500,000 he needs
for it to become a cinema.

24:37.810 --> 24:42.715
How much work does bringing
back the cinema require?

24:42.715 --> 24:48.754
PETNA NDALIKO: Wiring of
installation for power, we have
to redo all of it. We have

24:48.754 --> 24:54.093
also to isolate, so that we can
have a good sound isolation
inside here. And then all

24:54.093 --> 24:58.597
the speakers, we have to put new
ones. We have to add all the
curtains. The roof, we

24:58.597 --> 25:01.767
sort of have to redo
the entire roofing.

25:01.767 --> 25:06.305
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Ndaliko is not
the only one dreaming of a
cinema. He started a film school

25:06.305 --> 25:11.043
in Goma 10 years ago,
Yole!Africa, where there are
dozens of students with a
message in search

25:11.043 --> 25:13.512
of an audience.

25:13.512 --> 25:20.919
MAN: I dreamed one day to become
a filmmaker to change the way of
thinking of my people.

25:20.919 --> 25:24.890
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Young
filmmakers like Yannick
Chishibanji (ph) have a new
narrative to share:

25:24.890 --> 25:28.127
that Goma, their city,
is coming back.

25:28.127 --> 25:39.872
MAN: When you have 20 years, 25
years, all this generation was
grown in the war. We didn't

25:39.872 --> 25:43.642
have so much good examples.

25:43.642 --> 25:49.782
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: This new Goma
is emerging from war. The
students' films touch on modern

25:49.782 --> 25:56.188
issues, like women in the
workplace, and reconciliation. A
cinema would bring those stories
to life.

25:56.188 --> 26:00.025
Do you think it makes a
difference if they see a film
here, or if maybe one day there

26:00.025 --> 26:03.929
was a big cinema where
the community could go?

26:03.929 --> 26:09.735
MAN: If there is one cinema, I
think that, every night, we can
hope that another person

26:09.735 --> 26:13.038
who have been changed.

26:13.038 --> 26:16.809
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: You think the
cinema is powerful enough to
change the hearts and minds of
people?

26:16.809 --> 26:19.044
MAN: Of course.

26:19.044 --> 26:23.916
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Getting there
is half the battle. To make a
film, the school uses a

26:23.916 --> 26:28.787
gas-fueled generator to power
cameras and computers, because
the electricity often goes

26:28.787 --> 26:32.958
out. The Wi-Fi is
also unreliable.

26:32.958 --> 26:36.295
So lay out for me the things
that are the daily challenges to
being a filmmaker.

26:36.295 --> 26:41.834
MAN: If you want to go somewhere
and you want papers, because
everywhere, you would find

26:41.834 --> 26:47.339
policeman, soldiers, it's very
hard, because we have to give
money to everybody.

26:47.339 --> 26:52.544
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Chishibanji
made a film anyway, all about
his country. It's about a man
choosing

26:52.544 --> 26:57.416
between reconciliation and
revenge after his family is
attacked.

26:57.416 --> 27:02.588
MAN: Sometimes, we think that it
is the other person who is our
problem.

27:02.588 --> 27:05.491
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And, in your
film, who is the problem?

27:05.491 --> 27:11.797
MAN: The problem is the way of
seeing things, the
communitarianism, the tribalism.

27:11.797 --> 27:18.670
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
Communitarianism and tribalism,
without Cinema Virunga, the only
public space

27:18.670 --> 27:25.511
for a film about those issues
might be a street cinema with
blaring sound and blurry images.

27:25.511 --> 27:29.982
There are places to watch films
now. There are sort of makeshift
movie houses, if you

27:29.982 --> 27:35.120
will. Right? Why is a cinema
better than that, or different
from that?

27:35.120 --> 27:40.759
PETNA NDALIKO: Because the
cinema take you into the film
itself. And watching on the

27:40.759 --> 27:46.865
DVD, the quality is not the
same. And also create this space
where a family can sit and

27:46.865 --> 27:53.071
enjoy and have their popcorn, it
is a different experience, and
then also be in a cinema and

27:53.071 --> 27:56.775
feel safe with other people. It
is very important
psychologically for the people
around here.

27:56.775 --> 27:59.077
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
What do you mean?

27:59.077 --> 28:02.514
PETNA NDALIKO: Yes, like, be in
this dark place, you are with
more than 200 people,

28:02.514 --> 28:03.916
and then you still feel safe.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.350
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Does
that not happen in Goma?

28:05.350 --> 28:07.519
PETNA NDALIKO: Not
often, not often.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.321
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And is that
because of all the conflict?

28:09.321 --> 28:11.924
PETNA NDALIKO: Because
of the conflicts.

28:11.924 --> 28:17.529
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Yole!Africa
tries to create that feeling
with an annual festival of film

28:17.529 --> 28:22.367
and art, with deejays pumping
and music thumping, kids
spinning wildly in the air, with
a dance

28:22.367 --> 28:23.835
contest.

28:23.835 --> 28:28.807
Ndaliko's wife, Cherie, sees the
difference public art can make.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.309
CHERIE RIVERS NDALIKO, Executive
Director, Yole!Africa: It
changes people's lives. It's

28:30.309 --> 28:35.047
incredible to see people come in
having no sense of confidence,
no sense of their own

28:35.047 --> 28:40.452
self-worth, because they have
only seen images of themselves
that portray them as worthless.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.655
And it's incredible to see what
happens when they learn that
they can tell their own story,

28:43.655 --> 28:46.325
and in their version of the
story, they can be the hero.

28:46.325 --> 28:51.897
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Without cinema,
the best Yole!Africa can do is
fly in a blow-up screen

28:51.897 --> 28:58.437
from North Carolina. It deflates
if the power fails, fights to be
heard over street noise,

28:58.437 --> 29:02.841
and Ndaliko's worry about
being out at night.

29:02.841 --> 29:08.714
But as that familiar rectangle
of light appears, something
magical is happening too, a wow

29:08.714 --> 29:12.184
moment, even if
just once a year.

29:12.184 --> 29:17.422
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Soledad O'Brien in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

29:17.422 --> 29:22.260
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow night,
Soledad concludes our series
Congo's Hope with a story about

29:22.260 --> 29:38.944
the gorillas in the Congo's
Virunga National Park.

29:38.944 --> 29:43.782
Ever since Edward Snowden
released a mountain of
information about the extent of
U.S. government

29:43.782 --> 29:47.185
secret surveillance, the battle
has been growing between tech
companies and the government

29:47.185 --> 29:50.222
over access to data.

29:50.222 --> 29:55.127
One of the major fronts in that
battle has been the decision by
Apple, Google, Microsoft

29:55.127 --> 30:01.733
and others to lock down, or
encrypt, data on smartphones and
digital devices.

30:01.733 --> 30:06.138
But new reports say the Obama
administration may be backing
down from its demands.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.874
William Brangham has the story.

30:08.874 --> 30:13.545
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For months
now, the Obama administration
has said it's essential to

30:13.545 --> 30:18.884
be able to occasionally access
messages, texts and photos that
are sent on today's smartphones.

30:18.884 --> 30:21.987
But many of the latest devices
give individual users the power
to control their data and

30:21.987 --> 30:25.057
block others from seeing it.

30:25.057 --> 30:29.161
Until recently, law enforcement
has argued that this encryption
is making it increasingly

30:29.161 --> 30:31.630
hard to track terrorists or
criminals who are using these
devices to communicate with

30:31.630 --> 30:33.999
each other.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.001
For example, this is what Deputy
Attorney General Sally Yates
told a Senate hearing

30:36.001 --> 30:38.003
this summer:

30:38.003 --> 30:42.274
SALLY YATES, U.S. Deputy
Attorney General: ISIL currently
communicates on Twitter, sending

30:42.274 --> 30:48.380
communications to thousands of
would-be followers right here in
our country. When someone
responds

30:48.380 --> 30:53.585
and the conversations begin,
they are then directed to
encrypted platforms for further

30:53.585 --> 30:56.088
communication.

30:56.088 --> 31:03.428
And even with a court order, we
can't see those communications.
This is a serious threat,

31:03.428 --> 31:07.666
and our inability to access
these communications with valid
court orders is a real national

31:07.666 --> 31:09.901
security problem.

31:09.901 --> 31:13.538
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This past week
the Obama administration has
apparently backed off on

31:13.538 --> 31:17.976
some of its demands to gaining
access to our digital devices.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.712
David Sanger has been reporting
on this for The New York Times.
And he joins me now.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.380
David Sanger, welcome.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.382
DAVID SANGER, The New York
Times: Thanks. Good to be with
you, William.

31:24.382 --> 31:28.053
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The term of
art here is encryption. And for
those who haven't been

31:28.053 --> 31:31.690
following this debate very
closely, could you just give us
a quick primer? What is
encryption?

31:31.690 --> 31:35.060
DAVID SANGER: Well, encryption
is a sophisticated version of
what you did when you made codes

31:35.060 --> 31:38.363
when you were a kid.

31:38.363 --> 31:45.003
It is taking the data that's in
your phone and wrapping it in a
code so that if somebody

31:45.003 --> 31:49.875
got ahold of that phone, if they
didn't know the key, they
couldn't de-encrypt it. And

31:49.875 --> 31:54.112
sometimes conversations are
encrypted or data is encrypted
when it's moving across a
telephone

31:54.112 --> 31:56.181
wire as well.

31:56.181 --> 32:00.118
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the Obama
administration, as you reported,
has recently changed its

32:00.118 --> 32:03.722
position on this. Can you tell
me, what was it that they were
originally wanting, and

32:03.722 --> 32:05.991
why have they changed course?

32:05.991 --> 32:09.995
DAVID SANGER: Well, for years
now, the FBI has worried about
what they call the going

32:09.995 --> 32:16.201
dark problem. And that is that,
as more and more information is
encrypted, they feared

32:16.201 --> 32:22.841
that if a kidnapper had
photographs of, say, a victim,
if they were going after a
terrorist

32:22.841 --> 32:30.115
suspect, if the special forces
landed someplace, grabbed some
iPhones from a group of
al-Qaida,

32:30.115 --> 32:35.086
for example, that they wouldn't
be able to know what was in
those phones.

32:35.086 --> 32:43.028
And so the director of the FBI
made a very passionate case last
year for forcing Apple,

32:43.028 --> 32:48.533
Google, Microsoft, others to
build a back door, a way with a
court order that somebody

32:48.533 --> 32:55.707
could get into these phones. And
Apple objected to this, along
with Google and others, saying,

32:55.707 --> 32:59.678
if we build that back door,
someone else is going to pry it
open, and it's probably going

32:59.678 --> 33:03.215
to be the Chinese
or the Russians.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.818
And so that was one of many
reasons that they opposed this,
and in the end it looks like

33:06.818 --> 33:09.321
they're winning the argument.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.557
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But if law
enforcement doesn't have that
back door, then, as you
mentioned,

33:12.557 --> 33:14.392
it seems to make it more
difficult for them to do their
job.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.895
DAVID SANGER: It does.

33:16.895 --> 33:22.367
And that's why, to borrow your
iPhone here, this is a national
security problem in your

33:22.367 --> 33:29.674
pocket, and in everybody's
pocket. So, for 99.9 percent of
communications, the government

33:29.674 --> 33:33.011
wants you to encrypt more,
because they don't want
criminals to be able to get into
your

33:33.011 --> 33:35.714
bank account. Your whole life
is on this phone, right?

33:35.714 --> 33:37.816
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

33:37.816 --> 33:41.519
DAVID SANGER: Everything,
medical data, financial data,
conversations back and forth
with family

33:41.519 --> 33:44.055
members.

33:44.055 --> 33:49.594
And they're protected by that
four-digit code you type in,
which in turn creates a much

33:49.594 --> 33:56.067
longer encryption key. So, the
question is, who gets to hold on
to that key? And Apple

33:56.067 --> 34:00.772
said, we don't want it. We want
you to have your own key. Well,
the problem...

34:00.772 --> 34:01.539
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We being
the individual user.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.509
DAVID SANGER: The individual.

34:04.509 --> 34:09.481
So, if the FBI wanted your data,
or the NSA wanted to go in and
get it because they thought

34:09.481 --> 34:14.352
you were communicating with a
terrorist, what Apple is saying,
don't bring that warrant

34:14.352 --> 34:19.457
to us. Go give it to William,
and have him give you the key.
Well, of course, the FBI's

34:19.457 --> 34:23.962
view is, drug dealers,
terrorists, they're not likely
to turn over a key.

34:23.962 --> 34:28.566
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your
reporting, you also mentioned
that the -- that Apple CEO Tim
Cook

34:28.566 --> 34:33.705
said to President Obama that, if
you make me build a back door
for the U.S. government

34:33.705 --> 34:37.242
to get into, then it's very
likely that the Chinese are
going to ask the same.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.645
I mean, is that really a concern
these companies have, that other
companies are going to say,

34:40.645 --> 34:43.014
look, if you did it for the
Americans, you're going to do it
for us?

34:43.014 --> 34:45.951
DAVID SANGER: Oh, it's a very
real concern. And it may happen
even without the Obama
administration

34:45.951 --> 34:48.253
doing this.

34:48.253 --> 34:53.625
Look, what Mr. Cook, what
Microsoft, what Google wanted
was an affirmative statement

34:53.625 --> 34:57.996
from the U.S. government, which
they have not gotten yet, which
said, we're not going

34:57.996 --> 35:02.334
to force these companies to
build back doors, and therefore
you shouldn't either.

35:02.334 --> 35:06.571
Now, the back door in the United
States is based on the fact that
we have a court system

35:06.571 --> 35:14.145
that you fundamentally trust. If
the Chinese force a back door,
then almost any user, including

35:14.145 --> 35:20.618
an American user who goes over
and is visiting in China, might
have their data taken right

35:20.618 --> 35:24.222
out on the basis of a court
order in China, and the
impartiality of that court, you
don't

35:24.222 --> 35:26.725
quite trust.

35:26.725 --> 35:31.529
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
this is all on the ongoing
fallout from the Snowden
revelations

35:31.529 --> 35:36.034
and the tension that we have
between our needs for privacy
and the government's need for

35:36.034 --> 35:41.706
-- to be able to be good law
enforcers and to track criminals
and terrorists.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.975
Apart from this particular
issue, how do you see this fight
going forward from this point

35:43.975 --> 35:45.844
on?

35:45.844 --> 35:50.548
DAVID SANGER: Well, there is an
old saying in Washington that
nothing's ever over, right?

35:50.548 --> 35:55.253
So, right now, all you have is a
set of decisions that the Obama
administration has made, not

35:55.253 --> 36:00.492
to press this issue, not to go
for legislation. We have a
presidential election coming up.

36:00.492 --> 36:05.597
Who knows if the next president
will see it the same way, which
is why privacy advocates

36:05.597 --> 36:10.769
wants there to be a law in
Congress that says the
government shall not get a back
door,

36:10.769 --> 36:14.305
and why law enforcement
wants to go fight that.

36:14.305 --> 36:21.279
I think what you have seen
happen here is a truce for the
next 15 or 16 months until

36:21.279 --> 36:25.750
a new president comes in. But
this issue is going to come
back, because that tension that

36:25.750 --> 36:32.290
you describe between privacy and
security is one where it's
always a pendulum back and

36:32.290 --> 36:37.295
forth. And after a new terror
attack, some large incident
where somebody couldn't get

36:37.295 --> 36:41.800
the data, you could imagine the
FBI, the NSA, others coming back
and saying, see, we really

36:41.800 --> 36:43.835
do need this data.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.571
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: David Sanger
of The New York Times, thank you
so much.

36:46.571 --> 36:54.612
DAVID SANGER: Thank you.

36:54.612 --> 37:01.953
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now fears of a
third intifada in the Middle
East.

37:01.953 --> 37:08.593
A recent surge in attacks have
left at least eight Israelis and
28 Palestinians dead, including

37:08.593 --> 37:12.430
many of the attackers
themselves. After another deadly
day, many are thinking the worst
is

37:12.430 --> 37:14.699
yet to come.

37:14.699 --> 37:18.770
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Martin Seemungal reports from
Jerusalem.

37:18.770 --> 37:23.241
And a warning: Some
images may be disturbing.

37:23.241 --> 37:29.547
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Palestinians
proclaimed it a day of rage, and
a new string of attacks

37:29.547 --> 37:34.652
attested to the fury that's
fueled nearly a month of
stabbings and shootings.

37:34.652 --> 37:41.693
Today, a pair of Palestinian men
shot and stabbed passengers
aboard this bus in Jerusalem.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.396
Police said two Israelis were
killed, along with one of the
attackers.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.565
MICKY ROSENFELD, Israeli Police
Spokesman: Two terrorists
carried out an attack. One

37:47.565 --> 37:51.569
of them had a pistol. The second
one had a knife. The terrorists
were shot. One of them

37:51.569 --> 37:54.973
was shot and killed. The second
one was shot and captured at the
scene.

37:54.973 --> 37:59.210
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Within
minutes, another assailant
rammed his car into a crowded
bus

37:59.210 --> 38:04.549
stop in an ultra-orthodox Jewish
neighborhood in downtown
Jerusalem. Then, he leapt out

38:04.549 --> 38:11.556
and hacked at bystanders with a
cleaver, killing an Israeli man,
before he was shot dead.

38:11.556 --> 38:17.829
Meanwhile, north of Tel Aviv,
two more stabbing attacks
wounded five Israelis in
Ra'anana.

38:17.829 --> 38:23.501
Several were in serious
condition. Trouble also broke
out across the West Bank, where

38:23.501 --> 38:28.506
hundreds of Palestinian youths
confronted Israeli troops.
Soldiers used tear gas and

38:28.506 --> 38:32.710
rubber bullets, but, in
Bethlehem, the army said it shot
and killed a Palestinian before

38:32.710 --> 38:36.648
he could toss a gasoline bomb.

38:36.648 --> 38:41.719
In turn, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu convened an
emergency security cabinet
meeting,

38:41.719 --> 38:45.256
and condemned Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas.

38:45.256 --> 38:49.427
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister (through
translator): I am calling on the

38:49.427 --> 38:55.400
head of the Palestinian
Authority, Abu Mazen, to stop
lying. Stop the incitement. A
real

38:55.400 --> 38:58.436
leader must show responsibility.
You must stop the incitement
coming from the Palestinian

38:58.436 --> 39:00.238
Authority.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.907
NABIL SHAATH, Former Palestinian
Foreign Minister: Time is
running out, and running out
fast.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.778
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Nabil Shaath
is a senior member of the ruling
Fatah Party in the West

39:06.778 --> 39:11.616
Bank and an adviser to Abbas,
also known as Abu Mazen.

39:11.616 --> 39:15.587
NABIL SHAATH: I know Abu Mazen
and all the leadership is
extremely alarmed and afraid

39:15.587 --> 39:18.590
of this going out of hand.

39:18.590 --> 39:23.228
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The upsurge in
clashes between young
Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers has

39:23.228 --> 39:28.032
opened a heated debate: Is this
a so called third intifada? And
that's what Shaath is

39:28.032 --> 39:30.201
calling it.

39:30.201 --> 39:39.010
NABIL SHAATH: This intifada is
totally unorganized, unplanned
for. It is the natural and
spontaneous

39:39.010 --> 39:44.515
reaction of people who cannot
take Israeli despotism anymore.

39:44.515 --> 39:47.085
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The
demonstrations near the Israeli
checkpoints in Ramallah happen

39:47.085 --> 39:49.887
almost daily now.

39:49.887 --> 39:53.858
Twenty-one-year-old Mahmoud
Ayala attends most of them.

39:53.858 --> 40:02.267
"I am ready to sacrifice my
soul, my blood for Palestine,"
he says. "I want to be free."

40:02.267 --> 40:07.005
Palestinians in the West Bank,
in Gaza, are following events in
Jerusalem. In a violent

40:07.005 --> 40:12.944
assault on a 13-year-old Jewish
boy yesterday, the alleged
attacker was also 13. According

40:12.944 --> 40:16.114
to police, he was hit by
a car as he ran away.

40:16.114 --> 40:23.554
A video surfaced showing the
young teen on the ground, broken
and bleeding. He was allegedly

40:23.554 --> 40:29.594
denied medical assistance.
People can be heard on the video
shouting obscenities at him.

40:29.594 --> 40:34.432
That video was widely seen on
social media. It had a profound
impact here on the streets

40:34.432 --> 40:38.936
of East Jerusalem, adding to the
frustration and anger, creating
even more tension between

40:38.936 --> 40:42.640
Palestinians and Israelis.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.477
This Palestinian told us he was
afraid these invitations might
be mistaken for a knife

40:46.477 --> 40:48.680
in his pocket.

40:48.680 --> 40:57.188
MAN: I am afraid to see the
soldier see like a knife,
really, to shoot me.

40:57.188 --> 41:01.326
MAN: I'm worried. Yes, of course
I'm worried for both of the
peoples.

41:01.326 --> 41:07.398
So, if I were to go to market,
like we say, or go to any
places, I'm afraid for some
people

41:07.398 --> 41:13.037
to shout, this is Arabic people,
and some security or government
that didn't understand

41:13.037 --> 41:16.374
what the situation will be, they
are afraid, they shoot the
people without nothing.

41:16.374 --> 41:17.342
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: You're afraid
they would shoot you for no
reason?

41:17.342 --> 41:19.143
MAN: No reason.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.745
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Just
because you're Palestinian.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.880
MAN: Yes, just because
I'm Palestinian.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.751
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The Al-Aqsa
Mosque and the Temple Mount in
the Old City are at the heart

41:26.751 --> 41:31.422
of what is happening. Al-Aqsa is
the third holiest site in Islam.
The Temple Mount is

41:31.422 --> 41:35.727
the holiest site in Judaism.

41:35.727 --> 41:41.799
David Horovitz says that, when
Israel captured the Old City in
1967, it didn't want to provoke

41:41.799 --> 41:47.405
a war with Islam. Jews are not
allowed to pray on the Temple
Mount. But certain right-wing

41:47.405 --> 41:52.343
Israeli leaders have been
pushing recently to change the
so-called status quo.

41:52.343 --> 41:56.114
DAVID HOROVITZ, The Times of
Israel: The notion that Israel
might be changing the
arrangements

41:56.114 --> 41:59.784
there, which Israel says it is
not going to do, has been
utilized by people who want to

41:59.784 --> 42:04.155
stir up trouble. And we are
now seeing the trouble.

42:04.155 --> 42:09.594
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Netanyahu
accuses Palestinian and Israeli
Arab leaders of stoking the
violence

42:09.594 --> 42:14.031
with rumors that Jews are trying
to take over Al-Aqsa. He's also
stopped Jewish political

42:14.031 --> 42:17.969
visitors from visiting the site.

42:17.969 --> 42:23.174
President Abbas has disavowed
the violence, but has also
called for Al-Aqsa to be
defended

42:23.174 --> 42:30.415
from Israel. Jewish nationalists
rallying today in the heart of
West Jerusalem, a counterpoint

42:30.415 --> 42:35.553
to the fear, they call it a
display of defiance against
terror.

42:35.553 --> 42:40.525
DANIEL LURIA, Israel: There are
definitely some people who are
thinking twice about where

42:40.525 --> 42:44.662
they're going. Most people will
be looking around over their
shoulder. We have to be

42:44.662 --> 42:48.699
more aware. It's not just a lone
incident. We have got a lot of
enemies even amongst

42:48.699 --> 42:50.968
us.

42:50.968 --> 42:55.706
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And then,
suddenly, a Palestinian appears
with an act of defiance of his
own.

42:55.706 --> 43:03.714
MAN: There is nothing here.
There's never been a Palestinian
country here. There's never

43:03.714 --> 43:06.784
been a Palestinian country here.

43:06.784 --> 43:07.652
(CROSSTALK)

43:07.652 --> 43:10.254
MAN: Thank you very much.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.856
(CROSSTALK)

43:11.856 --> 43:16.360
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: It was a
heated debate, but it ended
peacefully.

43:16.360 --> 43:22.400
Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to
take aggressive action, calling
up more soldiers, threatening

43:22.400 --> 43:27.538
to set up checkpoints in East
Jerusalem. But there is great
concern tonight that this recent

43:27.538 --> 43:33.010
cycle of violence is beyond the
control of leaders on both sides
-- Judy.

43:33.010 --> 43:38.049
JUDY WOODRUFF: Martin Seemungal
reporting for us from Jerusalem.

43:38.049 --> 43:41.152
Late this evening, U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry
said he will travel to the
region

43:41.152 --> 44:00.037
soon to help ease tensions.

44:00.037 --> 44:03.875
Finally tonight: the latest
addition to the "NewsHour"
bookshelf.

44:03.875 --> 44:08.579
It's a look back at one of the
more turbulent political eras in
our country's modern history.

44:08.579 --> 44:14.986
I sat down last week with a key
chronicler of the times and a
principal player.

44:14.986 --> 44:20.892
We thought we knew him. His
political career, with its high,
lows and reinventions, have

44:20.892 --> 44:26.163
been scrutinized in hundreds of
books. Now a whole new Richard
M. Nixon emerges from

44:26.163 --> 44:30.334
Bob Woodward's new book, "The
Last of the President's Men."

44:30.334 --> 44:34.338
And Bob joins me now, along with
Alexander Butterfield, the man
he calls the ultimate

44:34.338 --> 44:36.941
insider in the
Nixon White House.

44:36.941 --> 44:39.644
Welcome to both of you.

44:39.644 --> 44:43.848
So, Bob Woodward, we really did
think and you say you thought we
knew everything there

44:43.848 --> 44:46.083
was to know about Richard Nixon,
but after talking to the man
sitting next to you, you

44:46.083 --> 44:48.052
learned differently.

44:48.052 --> 44:53.224
BOB WOODWARD, Author, "The Last
of the President's Men": For 46
hours and thousands of documents

44:53.224 --> 44:57.461
that Alex took out of the White
House, and I went to his place
in California and started

44:57.461 --> 44:59.597
looking at this.

44:59.597 --> 45:00.932
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD, Former
Nixon White House Aide: Every
memo that I wrote in the

45:00.932 --> 45:03.267
month of January.

45:03.267 --> 45:07.805
BOB WOODWARD: Quite frankly, I
was shocked, particularly about
some of the memos about

45:07.805 --> 45:13.044
Vietnam and the lies and
the contradictions.

45:13.044 --> 45:18.983
JUDY WOODRUFF: You kept this
quiet for decades, four decades.
Why finally talk?

45:18.983 --> 45:25.222
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: I was
lured into talking by my friend
here.

45:25.222 --> 45:31.228
Now, we -- Bob is the one who
approached me. I knew he was
interested in where I had been

45:31.228 --> 45:35.633
in the White House, but that was
a relatively unknown part of the
Nixon inner sanctum, which

45:35.633 --> 45:40.671
I actually was. And the more we
talked, I guess the more he got
interested. And I knew

45:40.671 --> 45:45.009
that a lot of it was history in
a way. A lot of it is history.

45:45.009 --> 45:49.847
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have
insights into Richard Nixon that
no one else has shared.

45:49.847 --> 45:54.385
You were the top aide to the man
closest to Richard Nixon in the
White House, Bob Haldeman.

45:54.385 --> 45:59.824
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: Yes, I
was Haldeman's deputy. Haldeman
knew far more than I knew.

45:59.824 --> 46:04.261
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you bring a
side -- we already knew this was
man of many layers,

46:04.261 --> 46:11.435
many complications, Bob. But
what we see here is someone who
was, for one thing, very
socially

46:11.435 --> 46:17.274
awkward. I mean, the first
meeting that Mr. Butterfield had
with the president was
extraordinary.

46:17.274 --> 46:25.282
BOB WOODWARD: And Nixon couldn't
speak in that first meeting. And
Haldeman told Alex,

46:25.282 --> 46:31.922
said, look, he hasn't met you
yet. He doesn't like new people.
You have to hide.

46:31.922 --> 46:36.761
And in the first month or two in
the White House, you were
sneaking around and hiding

46:36.761 --> 46:38.562
behind walls and pillars.

46:38.562 --> 46:42.199
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD:
For almost a month, yes.

46:42.199 --> 46:45.936
One of the first days, he said,
it will take a while. I have to
wait for just the right

46:45.936 --> 46:50.274
time, because he's a funny guy,
and new people spook him, new
faces. And I thought, now you

46:50.274 --> 46:52.209
tell me.

46:52.209 --> 46:55.346
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there's so
much about his interactions with
other people. There was

46:55.346 --> 46:59.216
a state dinner where he said, I
only -- there are only five
people on this list of 180 I

46:59.216 --> 47:02.486
want to have any kind
of conversation with.

47:02.486 --> 47:06.323
Bob, you mentioned Vietnam. I
mean, that was a moment, I
think, that will resonate more

47:06.323 --> 47:08.559
than any other, probably.

47:08.559 --> 47:15.166
BOB WOODWARD: And there's this
handwritten memo that was in
Alex's 20 boxes from Nixon

47:15.166 --> 47:21.572
to Kissinger on a top-secret
memo saying, we have had 10
years of air operations in

47:21.572 --> 47:28.546
Vietnam. What's the result?
Zilch. Nothing. It's been a
failure.

47:28.546 --> 47:35.820
Now, just the night before,
Nixon had told CBS News that it
was very, very effective.

47:35.820 --> 47:42.493
And you go into this, and you
connect it with the dots of the
tapes and other documents,

47:42.493 --> 47:48.766
and you see what was driving
Nixon with the bombing wasn't to
win the war, but the bombing

47:48.766 --> 47:56.574
was popular, according to the
polls, and so Nixon intensified
more bombing because it

47:56.574 --> 48:02.646
won the election. And Kissinger
actually tells Nixon, that's
when you won the election.

48:02.646 --> 48:08.586
And you read this, and it's
shocking and chilling, when you
see the deceit here for the
purpose

48:08.586 --> 48:12.857
of winning reelection. It's
the other side of Watergate.

48:12.857 --> 48:16.360
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alex Butterfield,
what -- what -- how did you deal
with that? What were you

48:16.360 --> 48:19.363
telling yourself when these
things were happening?

48:19.363 --> 48:22.666
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: I was an
integral part of the staff. I
didn't -- I wasn't too shocked

48:22.666 --> 48:26.771
by the things I saw.

48:26.771 --> 48:33.544
I wasn't naive, although it was
a totally different environment
than in the military.

48:33.544 --> 48:38.182
A lot of it was very petty. We
had big meetings about the
president's image and that sort

48:38.182 --> 48:41.986
of thing. But things I had
to do, I just -- I did.

48:41.986 --> 48:47.158
BOB WOODWARD: You said some of
it was a cesspool, that there
was this obsession with these
deceptions.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.026
(CROSSTALK)

48:49.026 --> 48:51.262
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: Yes.
You're sort of exploiting
everybody. How will it play in

48:51.262 --> 48:54.398
Peoria? We sort of said that.

48:54.398 --> 48:59.770
Or another thing I heard all the
time, we can always say that it
was national security.

48:59.770 --> 49:03.707
We can always say -- and the
intimation is that we're always
covering up. There was a

49:03.707 --> 49:05.509
lot of that.

49:05.509 --> 49:07.912
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also say
there were some good things
about the Nixon presidency.

49:07.912 --> 49:09.547
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: Oh, yes.

49:09.547 --> 49:14.318
JUDY WOODRUFF: The country
didn't completely suffer as a
result of his presidency.

49:14.318 --> 49:18.489
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: Oh,
absolutely not. And, also, he
wasn't a bad guy. I came to

49:18.489 --> 49:23.661
like him very, very much, partly
because I understood these
vulnerabilities, the fact

49:23.661 --> 49:27.998
that he was so awkward. Even
there were times when I pitied
him.

49:27.998 --> 49:31.802
It seems odd to pity the
president, but I truly pitied
him because of this awkwardness.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.538
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does
that surprise you, Bob?

49:34.538 --> 49:41.612
BOB WOODWARD: No, but this is
the kind of last piece of the
Nixon puzzle.

49:41.612 --> 49:47.618
And you wondered -- all of the
people who were in the White
House had affiliations with

49:47.618 --> 49:55.092
Nixon. Alex didn't. He was an
outsider. He became this
ultimate insider. And then he

49:55.092 --> 49:59.463
left with all of these
documents, at a time when
documents were being destroyed,
when

49:59.463 --> 50:03.767
there was that sense
of the unraveling.

50:03.767 --> 50:11.275
And I -- some of the stories
Alex told me, I just didn't
quite believe, frankly, until

50:11.275 --> 50:17.748
I saw the documents. And there
it was, things that you didn't
think possible, even in the

50:17.748 --> 50:20.084
Nixon White House.

50:20.084 --> 50:23.988
JUDY WOODRUFF: You are best
known for revealing the taping
system inside the White House.

50:23.988 --> 50:26.257
Why did you do that?

50:26.257 --> 50:29.260
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: I
certainly didn't want to do it.
Just three or four people knew.

50:29.260 --> 50:33.063
And we kept that secret
for over two years.

50:33.063 --> 50:39.203
But, when I was called before
the committee, I decided I would
answer only the most direct

50:39.203 --> 50:44.375
question relative to the tapes.
The most direct question. And,
suddenly, that question came.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.577
FRED THOMPSON, Minority Counsel:
Mr. Butterfield, are you aware
of the installation of any
listening

50:46.577 --> 50:50.648
devices in the Oval
Office of the president?

50:50.648 --> 50:57.254
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: I was
aware of listening devices, yes,
sir.

50:57.254 --> 51:01.225
FRED THOMPSON: Are you aware of
any devices that were installed
in the Executive Office

51:01.225 --> 51:03.360
Building office
of the president?

51:03.360 --> 51:05.562
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD:
Yes, sir, at that time.

51:05.562 --> 51:07.531
FRED THOMPSON: Were they
installed at the same time?

51:07.531 --> 51:10.267
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: They were
installed at the same time.

51:10.267 --> 51:14.405
JUDY WOODRUFF: Have we now
answered all the questions about
Richard Nixon and his
presidency?

51:14.405 --> 51:18.909
BOB WOODWARD: I think one of the
lessons here is, history is
never over, and you never get

51:18.909 --> 51:22.112
the full story.

51:22.112 --> 51:27.551
And particularly now in 2016,
next year, when we're going to
elect another president, and

51:27.551 --> 51:34.725
there are all these people
running we don't know much
about, and we need to know. And

51:34.725 --> 51:41.231
I think it's going to be our job
in the media to really dig in
and explain, so there's not

51:41.231 --> 51:43.400
a surprise.

51:43.400 --> 51:47.371
JUDY WOODRUFF: What questions
should we be asking, based on
your experience in the White

51:47.371 --> 51:50.641
House? What do we need to know
about the people who want to be
president?

51:50.641 --> 51:54.678
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD: Well,
obviously, we didn't know enough
about Richard Nixon.

51:54.678 --> 52:01.151
But, frankly, Judy, I'm not sure
that the American electorate is
going to do much more.

52:01.151 --> 52:06.557
I think Bob feels differently.
But would we have elected
Richard Nixon had we known about

52:06.557 --> 52:12.863
these -- odd behavior? He did a
great many good things,
domestically, as well as in
foreign

52:12.863 --> 52:14.031
affairs.

52:14.031 --> 52:17.935
BOB WOODWARD: But it wasn't
just odd. It was illegal.

52:17.935 --> 52:25.576
And it -- particularly in
Vietnam, the idea that the
president is going to conduct a
war

52:25.576 --> 52:34.385
and drop three million tons of
bombs in Southeast Asia, and
know and write secretly that
it's

52:34.385 --> 52:42.793
achieving zilch and a failure,
and, you know, I think people
are going to say, hey, wait

52:42.793 --> 52:46.196
a minute. We can't have
a president like that.

52:46.196 --> 52:50.901
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is an
extraordinary book, an
extraordinary story.

52:50.901 --> 52:54.505
Bob Woodward, Alex Butterfield,
we thank you very much, "The
Last of the President's Men."

52:54.505 --> 52:55.205
ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD:
Thank you, Judy.

52:55.205 --> 53:08.619
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank
you very much.

53:08.619 --> 53:14.324
On the "NewsHour" online: It's
the perfect example of a
cross-cultural exchange. More

53:14.324 --> 53:20.597
than 60 graphic artists from
Seattle, Havana and Tehran
participated in a traveling
exhibit

53:20.597 --> 53:25.335
where politics and prejudices
were checked at the door. You
can see some of their designs

53:25.335 --> 53:30.607
and hear from the show's
curators. We have a video from
Seattle PBS station KCTS on our

53:30.607 --> 53:36.580
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:36.580 --> 53:41.285
And tune in later tonight for
the finale of "Frontline"'s
three-part documentary "My
Brother's

53:41.285 --> 53:46.290
Bomber" that investigates the
Lockerbie, Scotland, bomber
mystery.

53:46.290 --> 53:51.895
And on "Charlie Rose" tonight:
actress Juliette Binoche on her
role in "The 33," the story

53:51.895 --> 53:56.433
of the Chilean mine rescue that
ended five years ago this week.

53:56.433 --> 53:58.702
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:58.702 --> 54:02.506
On Wednesday, we recap the
highlights from the first
Democratic presidential debate.

54:02.506 --> 54:05.008
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:05.008 --> 54:08.112
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

54:08.112 --> 54:08.479
you, and good night.
