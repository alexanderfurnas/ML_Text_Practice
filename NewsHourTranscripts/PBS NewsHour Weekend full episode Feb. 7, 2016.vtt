WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC

PLAN, TRUMP OFFERED THIS CLAIM:

07:45.767 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT NOW, WE'RE THE HIGHEST

07:47.933 --> 07:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I WILL SAY THERE ARE TWO WAYS

08:02.233 --> 08:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN MEASURE TAX BURDEN.

08:04.733 --> 08:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS COMPARING TAX REVENUES TO

THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:10.633 --> 08:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT OUT OF THE 30 WEALTHIEST

08:14.567 --> 08:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, YOU SEE

08:16.833 --> 08:20.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE UNITED STATES RANKS

08:20.267 --> 08:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
27th IN TERMS OF TAX REVENUES,

08:23.233 --> 08:25.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR

08:25.567 --> 08:26.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN

08:27.933 --> 08:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT THESE THINGS.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT TAX

08:30.767 --> 08:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVENUES ON A PER CAPITA, PER

08:34.400 --> 08:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON BASIS.

08:34.933 --> 08:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU DO THAT, UNITED STATES

08:36.800 --> 08:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T FARE QUITE AS WELL.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT RANKS 17th.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN NEITHER CASE SIT ANYWHERE

08:42.300 --> 08:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEAR THE TOP, AND SO MR. TRUMP

08:45.533 --> 08:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETS IT WRONG.

08:46.533 --> 08:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THERE'S ONE LITTLE THING I

08:47.733 --> 08:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO MENTION AND THAT IS THAT

08:50.667 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF TRUMP WERE ONLY TALKING ABOUT

09:01.133 --> 09:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE WORLD.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EFFECTIVELY, THAT TURNS OUT

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TO BE TRUE EITHER.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DOES HOLD THE RECORD FOR THE

DOWN GRADES.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CATCH HERE IS THAT CHRISTIE

11:01.267 --> 11:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY CAN'T TAKE FULL

11:02.367 --> 11:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT ALL.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT IS LARGELY, LARGELY

11:07.300 --> 11:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASED ON THE PENSION FUND

11:10.933 --> 11:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIABILITIES THAT THE STATE HAS.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE AROUND $33 BILLION.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ESSENTIALLY, THE EXPERTS ARE

SAYING THEY'RE ONLY MEETING

11:19.200 --> 11:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 38% OF THEIR OBLIGATION

11:21.500 --> 11:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THEIR CURRENT SET-ASIDES.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THAT

11:26.633 --> 11:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENSION PROBLEM HAS BEEN

11:27.867 --> 11:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDING UP FOR A LONG, LONG

TIME.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT BELONGS TO BOTH DEMOCRATIC

11:32.867 --> 11:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REPUBLICAN PAST GOVERNORS,

11:34.167 --> 11:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED-- BY

11:38.867 --> 11:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:44.967 --> 11:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD CHRISTIE HAVE DONE MORE?

11:46.567 --> 11:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE

11:48.300 --> 11:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATURE TO PLAY ALONG, IT

11:49.367 --> 11:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
