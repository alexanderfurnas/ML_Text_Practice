Never once in any of those
discussions was

00:20.821 --> 00:22.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there any discussion about
ransom.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was always about getting
our citizens
home.

00:26.126 --> 00:31.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the Olympics
wind down,
the stellar moments of the Games
are overshadowed

00:32.032 --> 00:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the fabrications of a gold
medal swimmer
from the United States.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We get a wrap-up from Rio.

00:38.538 --> 00:45.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: an on-the-ground look at
the mounting
human toll in war-torn South
Sudan, especially

00:45.145 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among the most vulnerable, the
children.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:50.450 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and Jennifer Rubin
are here to
analyze a week of shakeups at

00:55.289 --> 00:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and other political news.

00:57.257 --> 01:03.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's

01:05.799 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, in the
presidential
campaign, a major resignation on
Donald Trump's

01:17.411 --> 01:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team, new details about Hillary
Clinton's
e-mails, and a visit to the
flood zone in

01:23.283 --> 01:24.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Louisiana.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our

01:25.986 --> 01:27.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:27.487 --> 01:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For Donald
Trump, a three-fold
shift, first, optics.

01:32.392 --> 01:37.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, no podium or stage, but
the candidate
on the ground, surveying
flood-ravaged Baton

01:37.564 --> 01:38.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rouge.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
They need a lot of help.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's happened here is
incredible.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody understands how bad it
is.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was in part
pushback against
a vacationing President Obama,
who has taken

01:47.874 --> 01:49.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heat for not visiting.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he sent Homeland
Security Secretary
Jeh Johnson.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security:
The federal government is here.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have been here.

01:56.016 --> 02:00.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will bee here as long as it
takes to help
this community recover.

02:00.153 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Louisiana's
Democratic Governor,
John Bel Edwards, would prefer
politicians

02:04.992 --> 02:07.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Mr. Obama stay away for
now.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), Louisiana:
They free
up the interstate for them.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to take hundreds of
local first-responders,
police officers, sheriff's
deputies and state

02:15.002 --> 02:17.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troopers to provide security for
that type
of visit.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This afternoon,
the White
House acknowledged the
governor's concerns

02:21.208 --> 02:25.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said the president will
visit the area
Tuesday.

02:25.145 --> 02:29.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something else new, a shift in
Trump's tone
last night in Charlotte, North
Carolina:

02:29.249 --> 02:36.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Sometimes, in the
heat of the,
debate and speaking on a
multitude of issues,

02:36.256 --> 02:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you don't choose the right words
or you say
the wrong thing.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have done that.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:46.133 --> 02:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I do regret
it, particularly
where it may have caused
personal pain.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He didn't say
which words
he regretted.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a third change, today, Trump
put out his
first ad buy of the election.

03:01.581 --> 03:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In Hillary Clinton's
America, the
system stays rigged against
Americans.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The spot will
run in four
key states.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's ads have been
on the air
for two months.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Today, we face a choice about
who we are as

03:14.394 --> 03:15.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a nation.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I would like to
punch him in
the face, I will tell you.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Do we
help each other?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Knock the crap out
of him, would
you?

03:21.401 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For Trump,
changes on the
trail come, no coincidence,
amidst major changes

03:25.338 --> 03:27.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in staff.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaign chairman Paul Manafort
today became
the second Trump campaign chief
to leave in

03:31.011 --> 03:35.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two months, this amidst lagging
polls and
new questions about Manafort's
work for a

03:35.515 --> 03:38.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pro-Russia political party in
Ukraine.

03:38.485 --> 03:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Hillary Clinton, she was
off the campaign
trail today, but still made
headlines over

03:42.622 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her use of private e-mail as
secretary of
state.

03:46.026 --> 03:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reported that
Clinton told
the FBI that her predecessor,
Colin Powell,

03:50.931 --> 03:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encouraged her to use a private
e-mail account
for unclassified work.

03:55.469 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Powell confirmed writing Clinton
about the
benefits of private e-mail for
unclassified

04:00.207 --> 04:01.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material.

04:01.441 --> 04:05.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, unlike Clinton, Powell
didn't use a private
server.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton's V.P. pick,
Senator Tim
Kaine, is on a Western
fund-raising swing,

04:09.983 --> 04:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday, in usual Republican
states Idaho
and Wyoming.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, it was Oregon and
Washington, this
weekend, California.

04:17.557 --> 04:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With two-and-a-half months to
go, it's a race
for money and votes.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Good luck,
everybody.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention

04:28.935 --> 04:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is warning pregnant women to
avoid traveling
to Miami Beach, Florida, on
account of the

04:34.074 --> 04:35.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zika virus.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say mosquitoes in the
popular tourist
destination transmitted the
virus to at least

04:40.580 --> 04:41.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
five people.

04:41.982 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That area is just minutes from
the state's
initial infection zone.

04:46.052 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Rick Scott said that
Florida will
remain vigilant in the face of
the new outbreak.

GOV.

04:52.092 --> 04:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: We know
from our
experience successfully dealing
with other

04:55.462 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquito-borne viruses in our
state that,
through constant surveillance
and immediate

05:00.367 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action, that we will protect our
families
and visitors.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will continue the same
approach with the
Zika virus in our state.

05:07.140 --> 05:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The CDC also
suggested pregnant
women and their partners --
quote -- "consider

05:12.779 --> 05:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delaying travel to all of
Miami-Dade County."

05:16.316 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Florida now has 36
non-travel-related Zika
infections.

05:21.488 --> 05:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was yet another day of
cleanup and recovery
following those deadly floods in
Southern

05:26.893 --> 05:28.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Louisiana.

05:28.728 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 86,500 people have now
filed for federal
assistance after more than
two-and-a-half

05:33.667 --> 05:36.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feet of water soaked parts of
the state.

05:36.303 --> 05:41.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, most schools in the
Baton Rouge
area are preparing to reopen in
the coming

05:41.441 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

05:43.276 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Firefighters in Southern
California have made
major progress in battling the
massive wildfire

05:48.114 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
burning east of Los Angeles.

05:49.883 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fire, which first erupted
Tuesday, is
now about 26 percent contained.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's up from just 4 percent
yesterday.

05:58.124 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still, the fire spans nearly 58
square miles.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early estimates say that 96
homes have already
been destroyed.

06:06.900 --> 06:12.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 82,000 residents remain
under evacuation
orders.

06:12.105 --> 06:16.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Violence surged for another day
in Syria,
as the bloody battle for Aleppo
once again

06:16.843 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put civilians in the crosshairs.

06:18.945 --> 06:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fighting showed no signs of
abating, in
spite of international calls for
a brief cease-fire

06:25.418 --> 06:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow desperately needed
humanitarian aid
to reach residents.

06:29.055 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diana Magnay of Independent
Television News
narrates our report.

06:33.593 --> 06:38.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: The rebels have
broken the government
siege on rebel-held areas in the
east, opening

06:38.798 --> 06:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up one tenuous access route in
the city's
south.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some supplies have made it
through, but they
are vulnerable to attack.

06:46.840 --> 06:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government forces are fighting
to retake rebel
positions beyond this main road,
but they're

06:51.845 --> 06:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being forced to retreat back
into the city,
or into what's left of it.

06:56.383 --> 07:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're vulnerable, too,
taking shelter
behind a wall where they think
they can't

07:00.820 --> 07:07.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be seen, unaware of the rebel
missile headed
directly for them.

07:07.894 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia today launched long-range
cruise missiles
from warships in the Eastern
Mediterranean

07:12.832 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aimed, they say, at targets in
Syria belonging
to Fateh al-Sham, formerly known
as al-Nusra.

07:20.507 --> 07:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they have nothing to do
with the
bombs which each day destroy
more and more

07:25.378 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Aleppo, that Russia would
never strike
targets in populated areas.

07:30.183 --> 07:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But civilian targets are being
hit as a matter
of course across Syria.

07:35.088 --> 07:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night in Darayya, a suburb
of Damascus,
a field hospital was destroyed
by what the

07:39.893 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Free Syrian Army says were
barrel bombs filled
with napalm, and just north of
Homs, seven

07:46.499 --> 07:48.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more killed today.

07:48.668 --> 07:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fierce battles
are also under
way in Syria's Northeast, where
Kurdish forces

07:53.807 --> 07:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are fighting the Syrian army for
control of
Hasakah.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian government warplanes have
bombed that
city for two straight days.

08:01.581 --> 08:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday, the U.S.-led
coalition had to scramble

ground forces who are supporting
the Kurds
there.

08:11.191 --> 08:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Pentagon warned Syria
would be
-- quote -- "well-advised" not
to hit U.S.

08:16.463 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and allied personnel inside the
country."

08:20.266 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
touched down
in Crimea today, amid renewed
tensions between

08:25.772 --> 08:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his government and Ukraine.

08:27.874 --> 08:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been two years since Russia
annexed the
peninsula from Ukraine.

08:31.544 --> 08:37.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin's visit came a week after
he accused
he called Ukrainian saboteurs of
attacking

08:37.517 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian troops in Crimea.

08:39.786 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kiev denies the claim, and says
it's a pretext
for a new Russian invasion.

08:44.891 --> 08:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, Putin met with his
Security Council
and he doubled down on the
charges.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): It looks like our
partners in

08:53.433 --> 08:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kiev made a decision to escalate
the situation
and it's clear why they are
doing it, because

08:58.304 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't want or can't, for
some reason,
comply with cease-fire accords,
as well as

09:02.876 --> 09:07.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't explain their failures in
social and
economic policy to their own
people.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Russian military
forces are building up their
presence along

09:11.584 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's western border within
striking distance
of Ukraine.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will talk to State Department
spokesman
John Kirby about this right
after the news

09:20.093 --> 09:21.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

09:21.528 --> 09:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stocks fell on Wall Street
today, led by declines
in utility shares.

09:25.698 --> 09:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 45 points
to close at 18552.

09:30.370 --> 09:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly two
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped three.

09:36.176 --> 09:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, both the Dow and
the S&amp;P 500
lost a fraction of a percent.

09:41.114 --> 09:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a fraction of a
percent, notching
its first eight-week winning
streak since

09:47.454 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the latest
on the Olympics, the medal
count, and the

09:52.826 --> 09:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
swimmers scandal; how
reintegrating former
child soldiers is impacting
civilians in South

09:59.899 --> 10:12.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sudan; and much more.

10:12.178 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The January release of American
prisoners
from Iran was accompanied by a
$400 million

10:17.917 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payment, money the Islamic
Republic had been
owed for decades from a weapons
sale that

10:23.690 --> 10:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was never completed between the
United States
and Iran because of the
revolution there.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Obama administration
announced the payment
at the time.

10:31.698 --> 10:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, lately, critics have
alleged that the
payment's proximity to the
release amounted

10:36.703 --> 10:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a ransom, a charge the
administration denies.

10:40.039 --> 10:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yesterday, the State
Department modified
its response, saying the
millions of dollars

10:45.111 --> 10:49.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were used as -- quote --
"leverage" amid the
negotiations over the prisoners.

10:49.949 --> 10:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier today, I spoke with the
State Department's
top spokesman, Admiral John
Kirby.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Admiral John Kirby, welcome.

10:58.191 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have said that the cash
payment that went
to the Iranian government was
intended as

11:03.596 --> 11:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leverage to gain the release of
these American
prisoners.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is that different from
paying ransom?

11:09.702 --> 11:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State:
Well, I didn't say that it was
used -- that

11:12.906 --> 11:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was a leverage payment.

11:15.074 --> 11:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, this was Iranian money
that they
had coming to them through The
Hague tribunal,

11:22.081 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it was money that had been
frozen way
back in 1979.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it was their money and they
were going
to get it anyway.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These parallel tracks were
moving forward,
and they began to converge.

11:29.989 --> 11:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we took advantage of
the convergence
in a short 24-hour period to
kind of wrap

11:34.761 --> 11:36.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it all up together.

11:36.563 --> 11:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what I said is, though,
while there is
no connection between the $400
million and

11:40.600 --> 11:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the return of our American
citizens, we did,
however, in those endgame hours,
hold back

11:47.640 --> 11:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that payment until we knew that
our Americans
were safe and sound and on their
way out of

11:52.378 --> 11:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran, because, in the very last
few hours,
Iran was playing a few games
here on us.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we weren't quite sure that
the release
was going to happen.

12:01.421 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were worried about Iran
reneging on
that very lengthy negotiation
process that

12:06.259 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we put in place to bring them
home.

12:08.061 --> 12:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that there are
more Americans still being held
in Iran, and

12:12.899 --> 12:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we know that the U.S. still owes
Iran over
a billion dollars in payments.

12:18.571 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could that money be used to help
gain the
release of these additional
Americans?

12:23.343 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY: Well, again, we
don't pay ransom,
Judy, and this wasn't ransom.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a policy.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States doesn't pay
ransom.

12:30.883 --> 12:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The $1.3 billion that you're
referring to,
which was the interest payment
scheduled based

12:35.788 --> 12:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the $400 million frozen
assets, that has
already been taken care of
through the judgment

12:42.395 --> 12:43.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fund.

12:43.796 --> 12:49.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that money has been paid out
to Iran through
a separate process.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in any event, regardless,
we don't pay
ransom.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn to
Syria.

12:55.508 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been horrific images
coming out
of there in the last few days,
especially

13:00.713 --> 13:02.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Aleppo.

13:02.615 --> 13:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that Secretary Kerry has
been working
on some sort of military
cooperation, coordination

13:08.254 --> 13:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the U.S. and Russia.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How would that work?

13:11.691 --> 13:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY: Well, there's a
couple of things
here going on.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there is obviously a
coalition effort
against Da'esh inside of Syria,
which does

13:18.297 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have military components.

13:20.099 --> 13:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there is a very strong
and strident
effort diplomatically to come to
a political

13:26.039 --> 13:27.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
solution inside Syria.

13:27.974 --> 13:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, because the
cessation of hostilities
hasn't been uniformly observed
and the regime

13:32.111 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeps violating it, and Russian
military activity
keeps supporting those
violations in some

13:36.349 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regards, but we have teams,
Russian and U.S.
teams, that are working through
a series of

13:41.387 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposals that were agreed to a
couple of
weeks ago in Moscow by the
secretary and Foreign

13:45.625 --> 13:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Lavrov to get the
cessation of hostilities
enforceable nationwide and in an
enduring

13:51.464 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hope that they will be
successful.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as the secretary said
himself, this isn't
about trust and it isn't about
blind faith.

13:58.638 --> 14:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will only work if Russia is
willing and
able to use the influence that
we know they

14:03.443 --> 14:08.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have on the Assad regime to get
these bombings
to stop, to reduce the violence,
to create

14:08.514 --> 14:13.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only a safer environment for
the Syrian
people, but he still believes
that, if we

14:13.886 --> 14:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can create some breathing space,
if we can
create a reduction in violence,
that he can

14:18.157 --> 14:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the opposition and the
regime back to
the table perhaps as early as
the end of this

14:22.061 --> 14:23.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
month.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you say,
that is a
big if.

14:24.831 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But even if it did work,
wouldn't it mean
that President Assad would
remain in power,

14:31.104 --> 14:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the Russians now currently
say they want
him to do?

14:34.674 --> 14:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And doesn't that contradict what
the U.S.
goal is, which is to remove him?

14:38.911 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY: Well, I would say a
couple of
things there.

14:42.548 --> 14:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the Russians have
had a long
relationship with and in Syria
for decades

14:48.521 --> 14:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, and we have seen in the
past where their
Russian -- their activity, their
military

14:52.959 --> 14:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activity has bolstered the
regime in very
unhelpful ways, obviously.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will also say this.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians are a co-founder of
the International
Syria Support Group.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians signed on to the
U.N. Security
Council resolution which
codified that process

15:06.606 --> 15:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and codified the movement
towards a cessation
of hostilities and humanitarian
access.

15:11.778 --> 15:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians themselves have
said in paper,
in writing that they, like the
rest of the

15:16.616 --> 15:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international community, want to
seek a Syria
that is whole, and unified, and
pluralistic,

15:21.487 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safe and secure.

15:23.289 --> 15:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as part of all that, they
have also agreed
to a transitional process in
Syria to get

15:29.762 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a government that is decided
upon by the
Syrian people, and that's what
we're all working

15:34.500 --> 15:36.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
towards.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we have said our policy is
that we don't
believe Bashar al-Assad, because
of his brutality,

15:40.373 --> 15:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be a part of the long-term
future of Syria.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We still believe that.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is still the case.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our view is, Assad cannot be at
the head of
such a government.

15:48.681 --> 15:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Admiral Kirby,
one other quick
subject, Ukraine.

15:52.151 --> 15:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the Russians have
been beefing
up their military presence along
the border.

15:58.257 --> 16:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that President Putin is
in Crimea
today, which Russia invaded two
years ago.

16:04.030 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What does the U.S. think
President Putin is
up to, and what is the U.S.
prepared to do

16:09.502 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the Russians do go into
Ukraine?

16:11.971 --> 16:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY: Obviously, increased
military
activity along the border is not
going to

16:17.076 --> 16:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be helpful to creating a secure
future here
and to getting us past the
tensions and towards

16:24.150 --> 16:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a full implementation of Minsk.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Russians have committed
to Minsk
implementation.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We obviously want to see all
sides contribute
to that in a meaningful way.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means pulling back the
weapons.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It means pulling back the
forces.

16:36.762 --> 16:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It means allowing for monitors
to go in and
allowing for local elections.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we aren't there yet.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the secretary routinely
discusses this
with Foreign Minister Lavrov.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the outcome that we want
to see.

16:48.441 --> 16:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Crimea, we do not recognize
the occupation
of Crimea.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Crimea is part of Ukraine.

16:55.615 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have said long ago you
can't redraw
the borders of the map of Europe
through the

17:00.419 --> 17:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
barrel of a gun, as was done in
Crimea.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Admiral John
Kirby at the State
Department, we thank you.

17:06.792 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KIRBY: My pleasure.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks for having me, Judy.

17:09.795 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After our
interview, spokesman
Kirby made one more point about
Russian military

17:13.766 --> 17:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activity on the border of
Ukraine.

17:15.768 --> 17:20.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, while the U.S. doesn't
have perfect
visibility, it also doesn't have
indications

17:20.439 --> 17:30.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now that they, the
Russians, are prepared
to go across the line.

17:30.483 --> 17:35.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now that they, the
Russians, are prepared
to go across the line.

17:35.721 --> 17:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to Brazil and the Olympics,
where the
Games are heading into the final
weekend on

17:41.160 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and off the fields of play.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our update.

17:45.364 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Decorated
American Olympic
swimmer Ryan Lochte apologized
today for his

17:49.735 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behavior last weekend after
videotapes and
statements from other American
swimmers contradicted

17:55.107 --> 17:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lochte's account of a supposed
robbery at
a Rio gas station.

17:59.011 --> 18:04.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, on the track,
Jamaican sprinter
Usain Bolt showed he's still the
fastest man

18:04.383 --> 18:09.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on Earth, adding another
200-meter win to
his 100 meters earlier this
week.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He goes for a ninth career gold
medal today.

18:12.258 --> 18:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back with us from Rio,
Christine Brennan,
covering the Games for USA Today
and as a

18:17.396 --> 18:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contributor for CNN, and NPR's
Lulu Garcia-Navarro.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christine, let's start with you
and Ryan Lochte.

18:26.205 --> 18:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He apologized without quite
admitting that
he had lied about what happened.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we know, at this point, what
happened?

18:33.212 --> 18:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today: I
don't know,
Jeff, that we're ever going to
know exactly

18:35.748 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happened at that gas
station in the early
hours of Sunday morning.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not so sure at this
point if we need
to.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, obviously, that will all
be sorted
out as best as the lawyers and
everyone can

18:45.825 --> 18:47.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bottom line is, it's a story
that basically
just took over these Olympics
and took coverage

18:52.131 --> 18:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away from athletes who deserved
it, all because
these four Americans were out on
a night on

18:58.704 --> 19:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the town, apparently drunk,
allegedly vandalizing
a gas station, and then,
obviously, this cover-up.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And everyone, I think, is well
aware of the
story.

19:09.515 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it just was a complete lack
of where they
should be and what they should
do.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're a representative of the
United States.

19:18.991 --> 19:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know our senses are so dulled
by pro athletes,
Jeff, that kind of say, well,
they're always

19:24.196 --> 19:25.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to misbehave.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the U.S. Olympic Committee
is very serious
about this.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
USA Swimming is very serious
about this.

19:29.535 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The notion that these guys
created an international
incident, and Ryan Lochte even
spoke about

19:35.541 --> 19:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, he should have just kept
quiet.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to haunt him for
the rest of
his life.

19:39.512 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it will be -- this
is what Olympics
-- the swimming will be
remembered, sadly,

19:44.216 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not as much as Michael Phelps
and Katie Ledecky
in the first week.

19:47.153 --> 19:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and, Lulu,
he is now
possibly facing a suspension.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in Brazil, the Brazilians
haven't taken
this well at all, correct?

19:55.761 --> 19:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us about the reaction.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us how it's played there.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, National
Public Radio:
Well, as you can imagine, I
think it's been

20:01.133 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treated with a great deal of
fury and outrage
and disgust.

20:05.571 --> 20:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His actions are being seen as a
symbol of
the ugly American, and basically
people here

20:11.477 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel that the actions of the
four Americans
reflected very badly on the
United States,

20:16.015 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reflected very badly on their
Olympics.

20:19.118 --> 20:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel very aggrieved,
because all the
focused was on Ryan Lochte
having said that

20:23.722 --> 20:24.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he had been assaulted.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it made these Olympics look
very bad.

20:27.359 --> 20:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now they feel that he lied,
he misrepresented
what happened and that an
apology, quite simply,

20:32.598 --> 20:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not quite enough.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the apology that he gave is
being received
here as not really an apology.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't feel that he admitted
what they
feel is the truth, which is that
he lied.

20:41.741 --> 20:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lulu, is there
still any potential
legal or diplomatic implications
to come?

20:47.546 --> 20:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, I
think the diplomatic
implications are that -- have
sort of been

20:53.385 --> 20:54.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
resolved.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, three of the swimmers
are on their
way back to the States.

20:57.156 --> 21:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we understand that the other
will be leaving
shortly.

21:00.359 --> 21:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, therefore, I think it
has been smoothed
over.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The police do feel that they did
their job.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They investigated this.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They showed to the world that,
in fact, what
Ryan Lochte and his cohorts said
had happened

21:12.271 --> 21:14.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had not happened.

21:14.173 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the Brazilian
government, Rio's
government and the police feel
that they have

21:18.777 --> 21:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shown that they are responsible
and that this
is a place that has the rule of
law.

21:22.414 --> 21:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't think it will go any
further diplomatically.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so,
Christine, back
to sports now.

21:28.087 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, you and I talked
about swimmers
in a different context, swimmers
in the pool,

21:34.059 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and about gymnastics.

21:35.861 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this time, I think we want
to talk about
one guy, this great runner,
Usain Bolt.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh,
absolutely, Jeff.

21:43.369 --> 21:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for all the terrible things
that the Americans
did -- and they will get
suspended for it

21:48.007 --> 21:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost for sure -- then you have
got the joy
of Usain Bolt, and winning the
100-meter for

21:54.146 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the third time.

21:55.481 --> 21:59.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No man has ever done that
before, Beijing,
London and now Rio.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had to come from behind.

22:01.086 --> 22:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justin Gatlin had the lead with
about 75 meters
to go.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No problem.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Usain Bolt could not dance
and prance
and look around at the end.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had to pretty much run
through the tape,
the finish line.

22:11.797 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then coming back in the 200
meters, this
is a difficult double under any
circumstances.

22:17.236 --> 22:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usain Bolt turned 30 on Sunday,
the day these
Games end.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's not a young man in this
sport.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we know, he had a
hamstring injury,
and there's been a lot of
questions.

22:28.113 --> 22:34.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's now done the 100, the
200, huge win,
and if he gets the relay, the
Jamaican relay,

22:34.653 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will have an incredible
triple-triple,
three events, three different
Olympic Games,

22:42.595 --> 22:44.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and winning in them all.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has cemented himself as one
of the greatest
Olympians of all time.

22:47.466 --> 22:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, briefly,
Christine, because
we have also seen the continued
dominance

22:51.503 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of American women, including in
the medal
count.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Absolutely.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Team Title IX, we saw it start
in London,
Jeff.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We talked about it then.

22:59.411 --> 23:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about it again
now, Title IX,
signed by Richard Nixon in June
of '72, working

23:02.948 --> 23:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it way through the generations,
creating of
all these great athletes, the
girl next door

23:07.586 --> 23:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who grows up and wins the
Olympic U.S. medals.

23:09.722 --> 23:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. women are dominating,
winning about 60,
61, 62 percent of the U.S. gold
medals and

23:14.960 --> 23:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also well over 50 percent of the
U.S. total
medals.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And get used to it.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to keep happening
over and over
again.

23:21.467 --> 23:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Lulu, I
want to come
back to you, because we -- you
and I talked

23:25.404 --> 23:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several days before the Games
started about
all the apprehension, lack of
preparation,

23:30.276 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brazil's economic problems.

23:32.144 --> 23:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You even said to me, I remember,
at that point
that locals were ready to have
it done with,

23:36.548 --> 23:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even before it had started.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what's your sense now of how
people have
responded?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How has it gone over there?

23:43.289 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think you
can look
at this in two ways.

23:46.225 --> 23:50.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, when you speak to
average Brazilians,
they have fallen in love with
the Olympics.

23:50.729 --> 23:55.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have really greeted it with
a great deal
of joy, once the opening
ceremony happened.

23:55.467 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They really enjoyed seeing all
the people
here, and they enjoyed having
the athletes

24:00.506 --> 24:02.374 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
compete.

24:02.408 --> 24:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, of
course, there have
been a number of problems,
leaving Ryan Lochte

24:05.878 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aside, the fact that he might
have invented
what happened to him, but there
have been

24:09.348 --> 24:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assaults, there have been
organizational snafus,
empty seats, slow ticket sales.

24:14.586 --> 24:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think the epitaph for these
Olympics
is going to be mixed.

24:19.692 --> 24:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people will look at this
on the one
hand and say the Brazilians did
the best that

24:23.062 --> 24:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could under very difficult
circumstances,
but, on the other hand, this
wasn't an Olympics

24:27.700 --> 24:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a lot of people think was
up to standard.

24:30.069 --> 24:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, briefly,
still to come,
there are some problems, Lulu,
with the Paralympics.

24:34.373 --> 24:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, this
actually is
a growing controversy, a great
scandal.

24:40.045 --> 24:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, the Paralympic Games,
which did
so well in the last Summer
Olympic Games in

24:45.884 --> 24:50.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
London, are now facing
unprecedented -- an
unprecedented budget crisis.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, we have been told
today that maybe
10 teams at least won't be able
to make it

24:54.993 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here because Rio 2016 Organizing
Committee
doesn't have the money to pay
for them to

25:00.232 --> 25:01.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to be slashing
venues.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to be slashing
transportation.

25:04.703 --> 25:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what the head, the
president of the
Paralympics Committee said today
was that,

25:10.309 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his 50-plus years of being
involved in
this movement, he had never
faced a situation

25:15.681 --> 25:16.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is an absolute scandal, he
said.

25:20.285 --> 25:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's very concerned about
how these Paralympic
Games will go off.

25:23.689 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Lulu
Garcia-Navarro,
Christine Brennan, thank you
both very much

25:27.626 --> 25:28.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Rio.

25:28.994 --> 25:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Thank you,
Jeff.

25:34.333 --> 25:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're
welcome.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:41.607 --> 25:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
master filmmaker
on his work and new documentary;
and Mark

25:47.413 --> 25:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Shields and Jennifer Rubin.

25:49.481 --> 25:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The world's newest
country, South
Sudan, established in 2011,
again stands on

25:56.755 --> 25:58.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the brink of civil war.

25:58.390 --> 26:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A peace deal signed last year
between rival
governing factions is in
tatters.

26:03.495 --> 26:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than one-sixth of the
country's 12 million
citizens have been displaced,
and the humanitarian

26:09.601 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crisis there is worsening by the
day.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

26:14.573 --> 26:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For that view, we
turn to photographer
Sebastian Rich, who has covered
conflict zones

26:19.211 --> 26:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for more than four decades.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has been to South Sudan many
times.

26:23.482 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is there now on assignment
for UNICEF,
the United Nations children's
agency.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He joins us now via Skype from
Juba, the capital.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sebastian, thanks for joining
thus evening.

26:34.927 --> 26:40.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, tell us how it
feels now, what
the situation is like on the
ground now.

26:40.265 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RICH, Photojournalist:
Well, the
situation is a little more tense
than it was,

26:44.069 --> 26:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously, before the recent
fighting.

26:45.604 --> 26:50.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The recent fighting has put the
people, the
ordinary people in the street.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're much more tense than
they were.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's not so many friendly
faces.

26:54.279 --> 26:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you walk in the streets of
Juba now, you're
not greeted the same way you
were a couple

26:59.384 --> 27:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of months ago or even a year
ago, when I came
last year.

27:03.088 --> 27:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And how is this
affecting the children
that you're covering, that
you're there watching,

27:10.863 --> 27:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at behalf on UNICEF,
particularly
the issues of malnutrition?

27:15.300 --> 27:20.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RICH: Well, it's
affecting the children
very badly.

27:20.305 --> 27:27.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's 250,000, a
quarter-of-a-million
children suffering from severe
acute malnutrition.

27:27.913 --> 27:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not including the
children who
just got malnutrition, the first
stages of.

27:32.885 --> 27:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's happened is that the
children who
were actually starting to
recover from severe

27:38.156 --> 27:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acute malnutrition before this
recent fighting,
when the fighting happened,
those children

27:42.694 --> 27:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't come back to the
hospitals to get
their follow-up treatment and
children that

27:46.732 --> 27:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had started to get malnutrition
couldn't get
to the hospitals either.

27:50.569 --> 27:56.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So now we have this huge
increase in malnutrition
and severe cases of
malnutrition.

27:56.041 --> 28:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And UNICEF is trying its very,
very best to
keep on top of this disaster.

28:00.512 --> 28:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And you spent time
some today,
you were telling me, with a
young girl who

28:05.751 --> 28:07.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually has been making
progress.

28:07.419 --> 28:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And is there danger that this
could reverse
what's happening?

28:10.989 --> 28:12.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN RICH: Yes.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not all bad news.

28:14.493 --> 28:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are wonderful individual
cases.

28:17.896 --> 28:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, I photographed a
little in a hospital
in Juba.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she was on death's door.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was a tiny little stick
insect.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I stayed with her for a
couple of weeks.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she got a bit better and bit
better.

28:30.175 --> 28:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, six months later,
when I came
back, I photographed her and
filmed her with

28:34.746 --> 28:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her family, singing and dancing
to tunes on
my iPhone.

28:38.884 --> 28:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was fantastic to see a
success story
for once in this mess here.

28:44.623 --> 28:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And is there danger
that, with
this increased tension, that
some of that

28:49.294 --> 28:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
progress could be reversed or
lost?

28:51.563 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RICH: Yes, of course.

28:55.934 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Children will die.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I don't see how you can
sugarcoat
it.

28:59.204 --> 29:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't get treated for
severe acute
malnutrition, you will die.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not only malnutrition.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's complications with
malnutrition.

29:07.913 --> 29:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these children have on
top of that
tuberculosis and malaria.

29:12.384 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, put it very simply,
they will die.

29:15.454 --> 29:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And another area that
this sort
of increased tension threatens
are child soldiers.

29:21.960 --> 29:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen reports that,
perhaps in preparation
for tensions, that the
recruitment of child

29:29.301 --> 29:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soldiers is on the increase
again.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have actually been watching
programs where
they have been trying to take
them out of

29:35.907 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those -- of that situation.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN RICH: Yes.

29:39.277 --> 29:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, once again, the renewed
fighting has
caused more problems, because
now much more

29:44.449 --> 29:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children will be coerced into
trying to be
forced into joining armed
groups.

29:50.689 --> 29:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But UNICEF, once again, has been
very, very
successful in taking these
children who have

29:55.994 --> 29:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently been released from
armed groups and
getting them back into
education, and some

30:00.032 --> 30:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them for the very, very first
times in
their lives.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is a great success.

30:04.403 --> 30:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's going to be a great
shame not to
see this success actually, you
know, flower

30:09.808 --> 30:11.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into something very good.

30:11.443 --> 30:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talk about these
former child
soldiers going into school
again.

30:16.314 --> 30:22.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UNICEF says that half of
children in South
Sudan don't go to school, which
is the highest

30:22.354 --> 30:24.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proportion, they say, in the
world.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's it like for a child?

30:26.625 --> 30:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's a child's life like in
Juba in South
Sudan?

30:30.495 --> 30:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RICH: Well, all over
-- yes, you're
quite right.

30:35.167 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Sudan, there's more
children now out
of school than any other country
on the planet.

30:39.771 --> 30:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you have to remember,
that the war
here and the ongoing wars and
troubles here

30:46.244 --> 30:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have just basically stripped
most infrastructure.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so school, they don't have
desks.

30:51.149 --> 30:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have anything to sit
on.

30:54.519 --> 31:01.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I photographed yesterday
children sitting
on metal car wheels with no tire
on it to

31:01.059 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listen to their teacher, sitting
on engine
parts, sitting on buckets,
sitting on little

31:05.397 --> 31:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stoves that they take to school.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they bring the stoves
home, their
mother takes the stoves and
cooks them lunch

31:10.635 --> 31:11.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

31:11.636 --> 31:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's more, more than basic,
actually.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these are dirt floors as
well.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sebastian Rich,
thanks so much
for not only your insights on
what's going

31:20.579 --> 31:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, on the ground in South
Sudan, but also
for your powerful images of what
is going

31:25.183 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

31:26.418 --> 31:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RICH: My pleasure.

31:31.490 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you very much, indeed.

31:37.829 --> 31:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: The promise
and peril
of the Internet is the subject
of Werner Herzog's

31:45.937 --> 31:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new documentary out today.

31:48.173 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The legendary filmmaker was
recently honored
with an achievement award from
the American

31:52.711 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Film Institute for his work in
documentary
film.

31:56.181 --> 32:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, Jeffrey Brown
caught up with
Herzog to discuss the new film
and more.

WERNER HERZOG, Documentary
Filmmaker: This
is the birthplace of the
Internet.

32:04.890 --> 32:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his new
documentary, "Lo
and Behold: Reveries of the
Connected World,"

32:10.328 --> 32:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filmmaker Werner Herzog is again
asking big
questions.

32:13.398 --> 32:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: An explosion of
information
technology on the Internet has
led to some

32:19.004 --> 32:20.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its greatest glories.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This time about
the Internet.

32:22.474 --> 32:26.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: The Internet is a
manifestation of
evil itself.

32:26.244 --> 32:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Its history, its
impact, good
and bad, on all of us.

32:30.315 --> 32:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: That is the goal, to have a
team of soccer
playing robots defeat the FIFA
world champion.

32:35.987 --> 32:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: I try to be after
something
that is deeply reverberating
inside of our

32:43.762 --> 32:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
souls, some deep echo from --
even from prehistory.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What makes us humans?

32:49.401 --> 32:50.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do we communicate?

32:50.802 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where are we going at this
moment?

32:54.072 --> 33:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something for an audience where
they can step
outside of themselves, where
they can be almost

33:00.345 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like in ecstasy of truth, some
sort of deep
illumination.

33:04.749 --> 33:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I'm trying in
documentaries
and in feature films.

33:10.088 --> 33:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That search
played out in early
dramas, such as "Aguirre, the
Wrath of God"

33:16.695 --> 33:26.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in 1972, about a mad
conquistador seeking
gold in Peru, and, 10 years
later, "Fitzcarraldo,"

33:26.204 --> 33:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the story of a man obsessed with
bring opera
to the Amazon jungle.

33:32.043 --> 33:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That film would become famous
for what happened
behind the scenes, as Herzog
insisted on having

33:39.050 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his actors and crew actually
drag a large
boat over land, rather than
using special

33:44.689 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effects.

33:47.626 --> 33:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Herzog's quest for ecstatic
truth also came
through in documentaries, such
as "Grizzly

33:53.098 --> 33:58.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Man" in 2005, telling of a man
who lived among
bears in Alaska before being
killed by them.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Occasionally, I am
challenged.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in that case, the kind
warrior must, must,
must become a samurai.

34:04.976 --> 34:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: This cave had
been perfectly
sealed for tens of thousand of
years.

34:09.881 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And in 2010's the
"Cave of
Forgotten Dreams," which
explored prehistoric

34:15.587 --> 34:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cave paintings in Southern
France.

34:17.789 --> 34:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: These images are
memories of
long-forgotten dreams.

34:21.693 --> 34:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some 70 films to
date, a remarkable
career, one he's insisted on
building his

34:27.732 --> 34:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own way, despite setbacks.

34:30.468 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a series of interviews you
did over the
years, it's in a book called "A
Guide for

34:34.272 --> 34:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Perplexed," you speak of the
-- quote
-- "cumulative humiliations and
defeats" that

34:40.645 --> 34:41.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have experienced.

34:41.646 --> 34:42.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I wonder...

34:42.647 --> 34:43.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WERNER HERZOG: Yes.

34:44.015 --> 34:45.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who has not?

34:45.817 --> 34:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, who has
not, but what
did you learn from them, how
important are

34:48.253 --> 34:49.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those?

34:49.354 --> 34:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: You see, I'm
completely self-taught.

34:50.388 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I never went to film school.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was never assistant anywhere.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, of course, I learned by
trial and error.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My first featurettes were my
film school.

35:05.570 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, until today,
none one of my
first films has ever been sold,
but it's OK,

35:13.178 --> 35:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money lost, but film gained.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was a some sort of a
dialectic of
defeat.

35:18.984 --> 35:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somehow, it converts into
something that pushed
me forward.

35:24.856 --> 35:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I have learned a lot
through defeats,
and, until today, it's -- I'm
still haunted

35:31.596 --> 35:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by defeats, and they do happen.

35:35.066 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, a film of mine is
rejected.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And how do you deal with it?

35:40.205 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to learn how to
deal with it
and survive anyway.

35:43.842 --> 35:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It consists of modems, CPU,
logic units.

35:49.714 --> 35:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His new film, "Lo
and Behold,"
is divided into 10 chapters, and
features

35:55.220 --> 35:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interviews with early Internet
pioneers.

35:57.355 --> 36:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: And it was here that the
first message
was sent.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A revolution began.

36:02.861 --> 36:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Robotics
engineers pushing
the boundaries of artificial
intelligence.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It's one of my favorites,
actually.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: Beautiful.

36:12.637 --> 36:14.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you love it?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes, we do.

36:15.840 --> 36:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And leading
thinkers about
what may come, including life on
Mars.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I mean, right now, we can't
even get
one person to Mars.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: I would come
along.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wouldn't have a problem.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One-way ticket.

36:28.486 --> 36:29.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Sounds great.

36:29.487 --> 36:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: I would be your
candidate.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: OK.

36:32.757 --> 36:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: Here, all of a
sudden, we have
a revolution in -- in
communication, and it

36:38.029 --> 36:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is -- it is really, truly big.

36:39.931 --> 36:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is as big as the introduction
of fire to
the human race, or the
introduction of electricity

36:48.373 --> 36:49.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into our lives.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is very, very big.

36:50.942 --> 36:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I see how rapidly things are
changing.

36:54.379 --> 36:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, there is a
fascination, although
I use it very little.

36:59.017 --> 37:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do use the Internet for
e-mails, and sometimes
for Google Maps, and that's
basically it.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's it?

37:06.191 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: And I don't use a
cell phone.

37:07.826 --> 37:08.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You do not?

37:08.827 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

37:09.828 --> 37:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: No, I do not want
one.

37:11.129 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do not want it for cultural
reasons.

37:13.798 --> 37:16.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do not want to be available
all the time.

37:16.835 --> 37:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to have time to think and
to touch
somebody, and have a meal across
my kitchen

37:25.410 --> 37:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table without a cell phone,
being constantly
on tweets.

37:30.348 --> 37:34.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, at the
end of "Lo
and Behold," one isn't sure
whether to be

37:34.686 --> 37:37.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hopeful or not, right?

37:37.355 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's lots of reasons that you
give us to
be very fearful, right?

37:40.758 --> 37:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the robots don't get us, then
the sun flares
might get us.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about you, I wonder?

37:44.929 --> 37:46.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Are you hopeful?

37:46.731 --> 37:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: Well, I couldn't
say that,
because not only the Internet is
very fragile,

37:53.304 --> 37:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if that collapses, our
civilization is
going to collapse, and there
will be billions

37:59.210 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people dead, because we
cannot step back
into hunting and foraging.

38:04.048 --> 38:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that leaves
you?

38:07.652 --> 38:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: It leaves me with
the idea
we'd better anticipate what's
going on.

38:12.790 --> 38:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We take our right steps today
and now.

38:18.463 --> 38:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we'd better avoid, that we
are overdependent
on, let's say, the Internet.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're overdependent on other
things.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are dangerously
overpopulated.

38:29.874 --> 38:35.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But for however
many years
we have left, no lack of
subjects clearly

38:35.146 --> 38:37.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you?

38:37.081 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: No, I think it's
like burglars
in the middle of the night in my
kitchen uninvited,

38:44.122 --> 38:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they come swinging at me.

38:47.058 --> 38:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'd better deal with what's
the most ferociously
swinging.

38:52.463 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the last one really
swinging, coming at
me, was "Lo and Behold."

38:57.135 --> 39:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Werner
Herzog, thank
you so much.

39:00.705 --> 39:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERNER HERZOG: You are very
welcome.

39:08.646 --> 39:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's Friday, and
so we turn
to politics, and the analysis of
Shields and

39:16.921 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rubin.

39:18.723 --> 39:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
Jennifer Rubin, the opinion
writer for The

39:22.193 --> 39:23.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington Post.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Brooks is away this week.

39:24.829 --> 39:25.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We welcome you.

39:25.830 --> 39:26.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:26.931 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And good to have
you back,
Mark.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Good to be here.

39:29.767 --> 39:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's talk
about this upheaval
in the Trump campaign, phases
one and two.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a new -- Mark, a new
campaign manager.

39:36.741 --> 39:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have Paul Manafort out after
some stories
about his work in Ukraine.

39:42.180 --> 39:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that one of the new
folks coming in
is from Breitbart News, Stephen
Bannon.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we make of all this?

39:48.519 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, Judy, every
campaign is ultimately,
inevitably a mirror

39:53.124 --> 39:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reflection of the candidate.

39:55.526 --> 39:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The criminality and paranoia of
the Nixon
campaign began with Richard
Nixon.

39:59.764 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The discipline and, I would say,
the insularity
of Jimmy Carter's campaign began
with Jimmy

40:04.269 --> 40:05.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Carter.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's true of every
campaign.

40:07.171 --> 40:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a year unlike any year,
when voters
are so angry with Washington.

40:12.110 --> 40:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think Washington is awash
in money, that
money buys influence, buys
access, puts the

40:18.383 --> 40:20.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fix in.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what does -- Donald Trump,
who has an
advantage over Hillary Clinton
of 3-1 on someone

40:23.588 --> 40:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would change Washington, he
hires the
ultimate insider, the guy who
gets, according

40:28.493 --> 40:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reports, various reports, got
$12 million
in cash for representing the
pro-Russian,

40:35.233 --> 40:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pro-Putin interests and parties
in Ukraine.

40:39.737 --> 40:40.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is Manafort.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Paul Manafort, the
ultimate
insider.

40:43.207 --> 40:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now Paul Manafort is gone,
amidst charges
that this is just Washington as
usual, the

40:51.849 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worst kind.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And who does he bring in?

40:54.619 --> 41:01.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He brings in Stephen Bannon,
who's never run
a campaign before, who has done
a good job

41:01.192 --> 41:03.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of running a Web site.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been very successful.

41:05.496 --> 41:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he lines himself up with
Roger Ailes,
Roger Ailes, the recently
deposed chief of

41:11.402 --> 41:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX News, the bete noire of
every liberal
in the country, many of whom are
sort of lukewarm

41:16.941 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toward Hillary Clinton, and who
has just left
amidst a flurry of serious
allegations about

41:21.746 --> 41:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sexual harassment of women and
misconduct.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I don't know.

41:26.517 --> 41:30.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it just -- if personnel
is policy,
these self-inflicted wounds on
the part of

41:30.054 --> 41:35.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump are just, if not mortal,
they're seriously
damaging.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
all this, Jennifer?

41:38.629 --> 41:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: Well, I think
several strands
of the campaign came together
all at once.

41:43.434 --> 41:48.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One is this very odd
relationship, maybe not
even relationship, that Donald
Trump has with

41:48.706 --> 41:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin and the number of
advisers
around him who are overtly
pro-Russian, who

41:54.445 --> 41:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have made money in Russia.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's one strand.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The next strand is, there is no
campaign.

41:59.484 --> 42:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you were saying, there is no
one really
running the store.

42:02.954 --> 42:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is something more to a
campaign than
the candidate showing up and
giving a speech.

42:07.358 --> 42:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's ad buys, there's ground
game, there's
all sorts of elements.

42:11.596 --> 42:12.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I see none of that.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, apparently, Mr. Manafort
didn't do that.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe he tried and Donald didn't
let him.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe he didn't know how to do
that.

42:18.703 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's the second strand.

42:19.837 --> 42:22.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A third is, he's behind.

42:22.273 --> 42:25.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the national polls, I think,
underestimate
the trouble he's in.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really?

42:27.378 --> 42:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: He is trailing
in virtually
every poll in every
battleground.

42:30.581 --> 42:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now we have new battleground
states.

42:32.283 --> 42:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're called Georgia and
Arizona, which
is unheard of.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's another strand that
kind of came
together this week.

42:39.257 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the last thing is,
how is this
new mix going to work?

42:43.494 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump throws people out
and he pairs
people together.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kellyanne...

42:47.565 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Conway, the
pollster.

42:49.367 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: ... Conway is a
very polished,
very buttoned-down pollster, not
a campaign

42:53.538 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief, but a pollster, matching
with this
fellow who ran not just a
right-wing Web site,

42:58.509 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but one that really made its
money and attracted
a very anti-Semitic,
anti-minority clique

43:06.717 --> 43:08.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called the alt-right.

43:08.453 --> 43:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These two people are supposed to
work together
in some cohesive campaign?

43:11.322 --> 43:12.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't see it.

43:12.390 --> 43:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, this
is all happening.

43:14.625 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The evidence that we're seeing
is, Donald
Trump gave a speech in North
Carolina last

43:18.529 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night where he said -- for the
first time,
he said: I misspoke.

43:22.700 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't say what I should have
said in some
instances.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't say what he was
talking about.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: If I have caused people
some pain,
I regret that.

43:31.275 --> 43:35.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, he was touring the
flooding in Louisiana.

43:35.346 --> 43:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we seeing a different Donald
Trump now?

43:37.648 --> 43:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I mean, he
certainly admitting
that somehow he may have hurt
somebody's feelings,

43:43.721 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sort of the contrived,
counterfeit apology,
that if I in any way offended
you by burning

43:51.729 --> 43:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down your house and killing your
dogs, then
I'm sorry.

43:56.434 --> 44:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a man that we
saw at the opening
called John McCain, an authentic
hero, he

44:04.509 --> 44:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he wasn't a hero because he
had been
captured.

44:07.278 --> 44:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man who accused Ted
Cruz's father
of colluding with Lee Harvey
Oswald just days

44:13.918 --> 44:19.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
before Lee Harvey Oswald
assassinated President
Kennedy, I mean, a man who has
made just incredibly

44:19.223 --> 44:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outrageous, offensive, vulgar,
obscene charges,
and who ridiculed a respected
reporter with

44:27.031 --> 44:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a physical affliction, and over
and over again.

44:30.201 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I mean, this is something
new that we're
seeing in Trump.

44:35.506 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's giving -- he gave a better
speech, I
think, this week than he's
given.

44:39.110 --> 44:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it was a coherent
speech.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had echoes of Nixon '68.

44:42.747 --> 44:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't mean that in a
pejorative sense.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It really did.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:47.985 --> 44:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But he's not as
good on the
teleprompter as he is
spontaneously.

44:50.955 --> 44:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the roar of grease paint
the sound
of the crowd really gets him.

44:55.526 --> 45:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, if he is going to
give teleprompted
speeches, he is not going to get
that same

45:00.264 --> 45:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction that really gets his
adrenaline going.

45:02.767 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jennifer, some of
what the
campaign has been saying is,
this is going

45:05.236 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to let Donald Trump be Donald
Trump.

45:07.672 --> 45:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, is that what you see going
on here?

45:10.007 --> 45:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: Well, maybe
Donald Trump is
schizophrenic, because, on one
hand, he's

45:13.210 --> 45:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reading off a teleprompter.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, I think we
have come to
know the real Donald Trump, who
is irreverent,

45:18.082 --> 45:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is rude, who is aggressive,
who loves
that interaction, that
spontaneity.

45:23.387 --> 45:27.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think they have to figure
out whether
he's going to be something in
between, or

45:27.258 --> 45:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one on one day and another on
the next.

45:30.027 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mark raises something, I
think, that is
important.

45:31.929 --> 45:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, there gets to be an
incoherence
about that campaign.

45:35.866 --> 45:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His supporters love him because
he was outrageous
and frankly said a lot of things
that they

45:40.671 --> 45:45.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thought were politically
incorrect, which
others might think of as racist
or misogynistic.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the rest of the voters are
very skeptical
of him.

45:48.913 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does he lose both sides now, or
does he gain
supporters?

45:51.816 --> 45:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the
other side of the campaign,
because, Mark,

45:55.720 --> 45:57.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is out there.

45:57.355 --> 46:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's ahead, as we have said, in
the polls
in most of the battleground
states.

46:01.859 --> 46:06.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you see the kind of
enthusiasm for her
out there that we have been
looking for throughout

46:06.564 --> 46:08.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this campaign?

46:08.232 --> 46:12.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then you had another
reminder this week
about the e-mail issue, that she
told the

46:12.370 --> 46:16.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI that she got the idea for
using personal
e-mail from Colin Powell.

46:16.207 --> 46:19.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now says, yes, I suggested
it, but I never
suggested she use her own
server.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

46:21.345 --> 46:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, this has been a campaign
of self-inflicted
wounds on both sides.

46:25.349 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From 2000 to 2014, Hillary
Clinton was in
the United States Senate,
candidate for president

46:29.320 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then secretary of state.

46:31.689 --> 46:36.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was mercifully and happily
divorced from
the Clinton Foundation, which
was raising

46:36.861 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money from all sorts of sources,
many of whom
couldn't take a frisk.

46:41.132 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were people with an agenda
totally alien
and hostile to anything that
Hillary Clinton's

46:47.138 --> 46:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever stood for, and some people
who were rather
shady characters.

46:51.308 --> 46:56.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She leaves that job as secretary
of state
and plunges into the foundation.

46:56.781 --> 46:57.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She goes right into it.

46:57.782 --> 47:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, now she's afflicted with
that.

47:00.051 --> 47:01.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's stayed with that.

47:01.886 --> 47:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She gives speeches for $600,000
-- six-figure
speeches and won't reveal the
text of what

47:08.025 --> 47:11.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's done, again,
self-inflicted.

47:11.228 --> 47:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you point out the e-mail
server, the private
e-mail, all self-inflicted.

47:16.500 --> 47:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the perception of her as
somebody who plays
too close to the edge, who has
rules especially

47:23.407 --> 47:33.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, who has -- because of
her righteous
and moral impulses and beliefs
is somehow

47:33.184 --> 47:38.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exempt from ordinary rules and
is overly secretive,
I mean, that persists.

47:38.289 --> 47:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it didn't come from Donald
Trump and it
didn't come from Republicans.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It came from her.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jennifer, we
did have
Bill Clinton saying yesterday
that he's going

47:45.229 --> 47:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to -- he would step down from
the foundation
if she's elected president and
that they won't

47:49.100 --> 47:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be taking any more money from
foreign sources
or corporate sources, he said.

47:53.904 --> 47:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: This is the
proverbial closing
the barn door after the horse is
out and gone

47:59.110 --> 48:02.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and probably died, because he's
been out for
so long.

48:02.179 --> 48:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did they have those donors
all along,
as Marks points out?

48:06.584 --> 48:10.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was influence peddle, from an
objective
eye.

48:10.488 --> 48:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who wanted to be in close
with the
Clintons, who knew that she was
going to be

48:14.091 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running for office, gave to her
foundation,
paid her and her husband for
speeches.

48:19.463 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the typical pay-to-play
kind of game.

48:22.933 --> 48:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now to say, now that we have
taken all
the money and we have gotten
what we wanted,

48:27.638 --> 48:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is to get into office, we
won't take
any more, I'm not all that
impressed.

48:32.143 --> 48:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think the American
people will
be either.

48:34.545 --> 48:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, however, she is the
luckiest person
on the face of the earth,
because not very

48:38.749 --> 48:42.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many people are going to focus
on that part
of this week, with Donald Trump
doing his

48:42.419 --> 48:44.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
usual chaos routine.

48:44.288 --> 48:49.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, can she keep
going like
this, Mark, with -- you have
said self-inflicted

48:49.360 --> 48:51.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wounds.

48:51.095 --> 48:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, this is a
year, if it's
the fundamentals, it's a year of
change.

48:54.865 --> 48:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voters want change, and they
don't want continuity.

48:58.335 --> 48:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's the candidate of the
status quo.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a third Democratic term.

49:01.605 --> 49:05.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all the focus, Donald Trump,
instead of
being the candidate of change,
is the candidate

49:05.976 --> 49:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of chaos, the candidate of
crisis, And, I
mean, just -- basically, he goes
to Louisiana

49:13.784 --> 49:15.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today, which was certainly good.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what does he say when he's
there?

49:17.855 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He says: Great place.

49:19.290 --> 49:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had a great history with
Louisiana.

49:22.092 --> 49:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is a man who is in
stage four
self-centeredness.

49:26.530 --> 49:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he draws the spotlight to
himself,
and it helps her.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Jennifer?

49:30.801 --> 49:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I was going to ask both
of you.

49:32.903 --> 49:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is there with Mike
Pence, his
running mate.

49:35.906 --> 49:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama hasn't been
there yet.

49:37.374 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's still on vacation.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton put in a call to
Louisiana's
governor.

49:41.111 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of thing that
politicians
should be jumping to go do right
now at this

49:46.550 --> 49:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
point or staying away from?

49:48.352 --> 49:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: This is the
dilemma, of course,
that George W. Bush faced with
Katrina.

49:51.822 --> 49:56.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He kind of played it halfway and
got vilified
because there was a shot of him
looking down

49:56.227 --> 49:59.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at New Orleans from the sky.

49:59.530 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the president is right
to stay away
for a few days.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to go on Tuesday.

50:04.068 --> 50:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is an incredible
strain on the
first-responders, on security
folks, on all

50:11.475 --> 50:16.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the people who should be
spending 110 percent
of their time on helping the
people.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is what the
governor
said.

50:17.581 --> 50:19.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER RUBIN: Exactly.

50:19.316 --> 50:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for a candidate who has no
ability to
do anything about it -- you can
understand

50:21.919 --> 50:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a president who wants to see
things, wants
to assess how bad things are,
wants to get

50:26.023 --> 50:27.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a feel for things.

50:27.324 --> 50:29.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But these people are just there
to have their
picture taken.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mark?

50:31.528 --> 50:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I thought the
president should
have -- somewhere between his
312th and 313th

50:36.133 --> 50:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
round of golf, should have put
on a suit and
tie and spoken to the press.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president is not only the
commander in
chief.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the consoler-in-chief.

50:44.308 --> 50:48.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think just -- just to
tell, express
the sympathy, support and what
we were doing

50:49.013 --> 50:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a people, by television, to
the people
of Louisiana, not to go down.

50:54.952 --> 50:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Jennifer is absolutely
right, not
to interfere with that or upset
things down

50:58.155 --> 50:59.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

50:59.924 --> 51:03.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I just -- I think that's
something that
a president has to do and should
do at that

51:03.928 --> 51:05.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

51:05.462 --> 51:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the president, he
doesn't like
to be forced into these things.

51:07.998 --> 51:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think he resisted it.

51:09.934 --> 51:15.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think now he looks like
he's going down
in response to the criticism.

51:15.139 --> 51:16.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a few days.

51:16.573 --> 51:19.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, this campaign doesn't get
any less exciting,
less interesting.

51:19.610 --> 51:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, that's right.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
Jennifer Rubin,
thank you both.

51:23.714 --> 51:24.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

51:24.949 --> 51:28.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER RUBIN: You, too.

51:28.519 --> 51:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

51:32.923 --> 51:36.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

51:36.493 --> 51:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: New research
has shown that bacteria makes
some women more

51:42.733 --> 51:45.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
susceptible to contracting
HIV/AIDS.

51:45.135 --> 51:50.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But researchers think bacteria
could also
help protect women against the
virus.

51:50.074 --> 51:55.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:55.045 --> 51:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up tonight on "Washington
Week": With
just 81 days until the voters
head to the

51:59.483 --> 52:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polls, will Donald Trump's staff
shakeup help
get his campaign back on track?

52:04.121 --> 52:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as the FBI hands Congress
information
about its investigation into
Hillary Clinton's

52:09.026 --> 52:12.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails, will she be able to
maintain her
lead in the polls?

52:12.563 --> 52:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's tonight on "Washington
Week."

52:14.798 --> 52:20.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: Some gay
men were turned away from giving
blood after

52:20.838 --> 52:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mass shooting at an Orlando
nightclub,
and now the Food and Drug
Administration is

52:25.976 --> 52:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reevaluating blood donation
restrictions that
some call discriminatory.

52:30.614 --> 52:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The policy implemented
by the Food
and Drug Administration at the
start of the

52:35.052 --> 52:40.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIDS epidemic requires gay and
bisexual men
like Sam to affirm they have
abstained from

52:40.758 --> 52:43.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sex with men for a whole year
before giving
blood.

52:43.627 --> 52:47.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I went to go try to give
blood and again
was told no.

52:47.865 --> 52:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're being told, no, your
blood is not worthy.

52:50.601 --> 52:54.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you believe that
the FDA's policy
is discriminatory?

52:54.338 --> 52:57.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /PETER MARKS, Food and
Drug Administration:
I don't believe it's
discriminatory, because

52:57.708 --> 53:02.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe it's not a policy
that's based on
a sexual orientation.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's based on keeping the blood
supply safe.

53:05.449 --> 53:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:09.453 --> 53:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with
a look at a group that runs
towards airstrikes

53:14.124 --> 53:16.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to save lives in Syria.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:19.530 --> 53:20.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:20.531 --> 53:30.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.

53:30.574 --> 53:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
