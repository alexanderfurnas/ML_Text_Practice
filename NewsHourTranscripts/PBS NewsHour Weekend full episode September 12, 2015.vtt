00:05.372 --> 00:07.140
FOR SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12:

00:07.140 --> 00:08.876
AS GERMANY AND AUSTRIA PREPARE

00:08.876 --> 00:10.544
TO RECEIVE MORE REFUGEES AND

00:10.544 --> 00:12.512
MIGRANTS, HUNGARY LOOKS TO STOP

00:12.512 --> 00:14.348
THE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS ITS

00:14.348 --> 00:15.315
BORDERS.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.017
AND, IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:17.017 --> 00:18.185
FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO

00:18.185 --> 00:20.254
INCARCERATION FOR TEENAGE GIRLS

00:20.254 --> 00:21.855
IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.323
>> THEY CONSISTENTLY WORK WITH

00:23.323 --> 00:24.625
ME, CONSTANTLY.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.425
EVEN WHEN I WANT TO THROW IN THE

00:25.425 --> 00:26.827
TOWEL, I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF,

00:26.827 --> 00:29.062
"NO, I CAN'T, I CAN'T."

00:29.062 --> 00:29.930
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:29.930 --> 00:31.498
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.402
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:35.402 --> 00:37.204
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:37.204 --> 00:39.873
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.275
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING

00:41.275 --> 00:42.209
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.977
EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE TRYING TO

00:43.977 --> 00:45.913
UNITE BEHIND A PLAN TO COPE WITH

00:45.913 --> 00:47.714
THEIR ONGOING SURGE OF MIGRANTS

00:47.714 --> 00:49.516
AND REFUGEES ARRIVING MAINLY

00:49.516 --> 00:50.851
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.387
MORE THAN 430,000 MIGRANTS HAVE

00:53.387 --> 00:55.322
CROSSED THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA

00:55.322 --> 00:56.690
FOR EUROPE THIS YEAR, MOST

00:56.690 --> 00:57.491
PUSHING TOWARD NORTHERN AND

00:57.491 --> 00:59.092
WESTERN EUROPE.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.761
ON MONDAY, THE 28-NATION

01:00.761 --> 01:02.195
EUROPEAN UNION WILL HOLD AN

01:02.195 --> 01:03.897
EMERGENCY SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS,

01:03.897 --> 01:05.933
BELGIUM, TO TRY TO AGREE ON HOW

01:05.933 --> 01:06.767
MANY ASYLUM SEEKERS EACH COUNTRY

01:06.767 --> 01:08.602
WILL ACCEPT.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.203
THE NEWSHOUR'S WILLIAM BRANGHAM

01:10.203 --> 01:11.872
HAS BEEN REPORTING ALL WEEK FROM

01:11.872 --> 01:12.873
HUNGARY, HE IS NOW IN VIENNA,

01:12.873 --> 01:13.507
AUSTRIA AND I SPOKE TO HIM

01:13.507 --> 01:14.541
EARLIER TODAY.

01:14.541 --> 01:15.642
WILLIAM, AMONG THE EUROPEAN

01:15.642 --> 01:17.277
COUNTRIES, HUNGARY HAS BEEN THE

01:17.277 --> 01:18.946
MOST CRITICAL OF EUROPE'S

01:18.946 --> 01:20.147
BROADER RESPONSE TO THE

01:20.147 --> 01:21.048
REFUGEES' ARRIVAL.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.950
YOU'VE BEEN THERE IN HUNGARY ALL

01:22.950 --> 01:23.617
WEEK.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.885
SO WHAT ARE THE HUNGARIANS

01:24.885 --> 01:27.554
ARGUING OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH

01:27.554 --> 01:28.855
THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING

01:28.855 --> 01:29.823
TO THEIR DOOR?

01:29.823 --> 01:30.624
>> Reporter: WELL, HUNGARY IS

01:30.624 --> 01:31.425
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IT

01:31.425 --> 01:32.960
POSSIBLY CAN TO SHUT THAT DOOR.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.595
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN VERY

01:35.595 --> 01:36.396
CRITICAL OF THE WAY THE

01:36.396 --> 01:37.564
EUROPEANS HAVE RESPONDED TO THE

01:37.564 --> 01:38.899
MIGRANT CRISIS.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.201
HE IS ARGUING FOR HIS COUNTRY

01:41.201 --> 01:42.970
AND EUROPE AS A WHOLE THIS IS

01:42.970 --> 01:45.138
ABOUT THEM DEFENDING THE

01:45.138 --> 01:46.606
CHRISTIAN IDENTITY OF THE

01:46.606 --> 01:48.742
LARGELY MUSLIM GROUP OF REFUGEES

01:48.742 --> 01:49.843
COMING TO EUROPE.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.244
AND HE HAS DONE MORE THAN

01:51.244 --> 01:53.280
ANY OTHER EUROPEAN NATION TO DO

01:53.280 --> 01:54.548
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO STOP THOSE

01:54.548 --> 01:55.449
PEOPLE ARE COMING.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.616
HE'S BUILDING A FENCE ALONG THE

01:56.616 --> 01:58.352
BORDER IN SYRIA, AND HE'S

01:58.352 --> 02:02.723
PRESSED FOR NEW LAWS AND

02:02.723 --> 02:04.057
ABILITIES FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO

02:04.057 --> 02:06.626
ARREST PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING IN.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.729
SO AT THIS MEETING ON MONDAY IN

02:08.729 --> 02:10.430
BRUSSELS, THE HUNGARIANS AND THE

02:10.430 --> 02:11.231
HUNGARIAN POSITION IS GOING TO

02:11.231 --> 02:12.566
BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THORNS IN

02:12.566 --> 02:15.035
THE SIDE OF THE E.U. MINISTERS

02:15.035 --> 02:16.470
WHO ARE TRYING TO GET SOME KIND

02:16.470 --> 02:18.238
OF A CONSENSUS HERE.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.540
>> Sreenivasan: THE E.U. IS

02:20.540 --> 02:22.009
PROPOSING A QUOTA SYSTEM WHERE

02:22.009 --> 02:23.944
DIFFERENT NATIONS WOULD ACCEPT

02:23.944 --> 02:25.412
DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF REFUGEES

02:25.412 --> 02:27.247
DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE AND

02:27.247 --> 02:28.448
ECONOMIC STRENGTH.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.983
SO HOW ARE THE MEMBER NATIONS

02:29.983 --> 02:31.918
RESPONDING TO THIS JUDGED WHAT

02:31.918 --> 02:33.854
ARE THE REMAINING CHALLENGES?

02:33.854 --> 02:35.389
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW IT'S

02:35.389 --> 02:36.590
NOT LOOKING GOOD.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.725
YESTERDAY, THE E.U. TRIED TO GET

02:38.725 --> 02:39.993
SEVERAL CENTRAL EUROPEAN NATIONS

02:39.993 --> 02:41.695
TO AGREE ON A TENTATIVE

02:41.695 --> 02:42.863
AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO THIS

02:42.863 --> 02:44.664
QUOTA PLAN AND THAT WAS

02:44.664 --> 02:45.065
REJECTED.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.266
THE TRICKY PART OF ALL OF THIS

02:46.266 --> 02:48.301
IS THE NUMBERS KEEP GETTING

02:48.301 --> 02:49.336
BIGGER AND BIGGER.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.272
THE E.U. RIGHT NOW IS HAGGLING

02:52.272 --> 02:53.907
WITH THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO

02:53.907 --> 02:54.941
SETTLE THE REFUGEES OVER THE

02:54.941 --> 02:55.675
NEXT TWO YEARS.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.679
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE U.N. PUT

02:58.679 --> 03:01.848
OUT AN ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SEE

03:01.848 --> 03:02.716
850,000 PEOPLE COMING IN OVER

03:02.716 --> 03:04.518
THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR, SO THE

03:04.518 --> 03:05.685
NUMBERS KEEP SNOWBALLING AND

03:05.685 --> 03:07.254
THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CONCERN

03:07.254 --> 03:09.423
AS THESE NUMBERS GROW BIGGER AND

03:09.423 --> 03:11.058
BIG THEY'RE THAT GROWING NUMBER

03:11.058 --> 03:12.392
COULD EVEN UNDERMINE SOME OF THE

03:12.392 --> 03:13.894
GOOD WILL THAT EXISTS IN SOME OF

03:13.894 --> 03:16.329
THE FRIENDLIER NATIONS,

03:16.329 --> 03:18.098
SO-CALLED FRIENDLIER NATIONS,

03:18.098 --> 03:19.966
LIKE SWEDEN AND GERMANY, THAT IF

03:19.966 --> 03:21.401
THEY SEE INCREASE NUMBERS OF

03:21.401 --> 03:22.502
PEOPLE COMING TO THEIR BORDERS

03:22.502 --> 03:24.371
THEY MIGHT GET COLD FEET ABOUT

03:24.371 --> 03:25.539
THIS WHOLE IDEA.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.306
>> Sreenivasan: YOU SPENT A

03:26.306 --> 03:27.507
WEEK THIS WEEK TALKING WITH

03:27.507 --> 03:28.208
SEVERAL REFUGEES.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.476
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING FROM

03:29.476 --> 03:31.144
THEM ABOUT WHY THEY'RE COMING,

03:31.144 --> 03:32.546
WHY THEY'RE TAKING THIS RISK ON

03:32.546 --> 03:34.648
THIS JOURNEY OR WHY NOW AFTER

03:34.648 --> 03:35.182
YEARS OF WAR.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.283
>> QUITE SIMPLY, IT'S BEEN THE

03:36.283 --> 03:37.417
SYRIAN CIVIL WAR.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.952
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WE MET

03:38.952 --> 03:40.821
WERE SYRIANS AND THEY SAID THEY

03:40.821 --> 03:41.988
LEFT THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF

03:41.988 --> 03:43.256
THE VIOLENCE TEARING THEIR

03:43.256 --> 03:44.724
COUNTRY APART FOR THE LAST FIVE

03:44.724 --> 03:45.826
YEARS.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.993
WE MET A FATHER EARLIER THIS

03:46.993 --> 03:48.829
WEEK WHO TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT

03:48.829 --> 03:49.763
HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.564
HE WAS TRAVELING WITH HIS

03:50.564 --> 03:51.698
FOUR-YEAR-OLD AND A

03:51.698 --> 03:52.432
THREE-YEAR-OLD.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.733
HE SAID HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD

03:53.733 --> 03:55.469
DAUGHTER IS NOW RELUCTANT TO LET

03:55.469 --> 03:56.837
HIM WALK OUT THE DOOR ANY TIME

03:56.837 --> 03:58.238
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SURE HE IS

03:58.238 --> 03:59.706
GOING TO COME BACK IN.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.174
I THINK IF YOU'RE A FATHER, IF

04:01.174 --> 04:03.009
YOU'RE ANY PARENT, AND THE WAR

04:03.009 --> 04:04.478
ALL AROUND YOU HAS GOTTEN SO

04:04.478 --> 04:05.245
PERVASIVE THAT YOUR

04:05.245 --> 04:06.413
FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IS AFRAID

04:06.413 --> 04:07.747
TO LET YOU GO OUT THE DOOR TO

04:07.747 --> 04:09.182
WORK IN THE MORNING, I THINK

04:09.182 --> 04:10.117
MOST PARENTS WOULD AGREE THAT'S

04:10.117 --> 04:11.751
A GOOD REASON TO LEAVE YOUR LIFE

04:11.751 --> 04:14.287
BEHIND.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.389
>> Sreenivasan: PEOPLE HAVE

04:16.389 --> 04:19.426
BEEN FLEEING SYRIA SINCE THE WAR

04:19.426 --> 04:22.696
STARTED 4 AND A HALF YEARS AGO.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.430
>> Reporter: THE SYRIAN

04:23.430 --> 04:24.731
REFUGEE CRISIS IS NOT A NEW

04:24.731 --> 04:25.065
THING.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.133
IT'S BEEN GOING ON AS LONG AS

04:26.133 --> 04:30.504
THE SYRIAN WAR, WHICH IS 2011.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.039
THE THING THAT IS NEW IS WHERE

04:33.039 --> 04:34.341
THE REFUGEES ARE GOING.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.042
FOR YEARS THE REFUGEES SIMPLY

04:36.042 --> 04:37.944
POURED INTO THE BORDERING ARAB

04:37.944 --> 04:39.913
STATES-- JORDAN, TURKEY, AND

04:39.913 --> 04:40.947
LEBANON.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.249
AND THE NUMBER THERE ARE PRETTY

04:42.249 --> 04:43.049
STAGGERING.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.551
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THREE TO

04:44.551 --> 04:46.052
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE HAVE NOW

04:46.052 --> 04:47.687
FLED SYRIA AND GONE INTO THOSE

04:47.687 --> 04:48.622
NATIONS.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.523
IF YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE THE

04:49.523 --> 04:51.291
SATARI REFUGEE CAMP IN JORDAN,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.160
IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST

04:53.160 --> 04:54.995
CITIES IN THAT ENTIRE COUNTRY.

04:54.995 --> 04:55.929
SO WHILE THE NUMBERS COMING TO

04:55.929 --> 04:57.898
EUROPE ARE LARGE, THEY PALE IN

04:57.898 --> 05:02.302
COMPARISON.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.303
>> Sreenivasan: WILLIAM

05:03.303 --> 05:04.070
BRANGHAM JOINING US FROM

05:04.070 --> 05:06.106
AUSTRIA, THANKS SO MUCH.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.741
>> THANKS, HARI.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.542
>> Sreenivasan: AS MANY

05:08.542 --> 05:10.076
AS 10,000 MIGRANTS ARE EXPECTED

05:10.076 --> 05:11.912
TO ARRIVE IN MUNICH TODAY.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.380
GERMANY TAKES IN MORE ASYLUM

05:13.380 --> 05:14.814
SEEKERS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY

05:14.814 --> 05:17.050
IN EUROPE AND EXPECTS TO HANDLE

05:17.050 --> 05:19.886
AT LEAST 800,000 THIS YEAR.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.887
FOR MORE ON THAT, WE ARE JOINED

05:20.887 --> 05:22.389
VIA SKYPE BY NOAH BARKIN OF

05:22.389 --> 05:22.889
REUTERS.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.125
HOW IS GERMANY RECEIVING THIS

05:25.125 --> 05:27.160
INFLUX OF HUMANITY DAY AFTER

05:27.160 --> 05:28.662
DAY?

05:28.662 --> 05:29.396
>> WELL, WE'VE ALL SEEN THE

05:29.396 --> 05:31.231
PICTURES, THE IMAGES IN THE

05:31.231 --> 05:35.001
MEDIA, GERMANS WELCOMING ASYLUM

05:35.001 --> 05:36.503
SEEKERS WHO COME OVER FROM

05:36.503 --> 05:38.905
HUNGARY THROUGH AUSTRIA, MOST OF

05:38.905 --> 05:40.407
THEM ARRIVING IN MUNICH,

05:40.407 --> 05:43.777
WELCOMING THEM WITH OPEN ARMS,

05:43.777 --> 05:44.978
SIGNS OF WELCOME, HANDING OUT

05:44.978 --> 05:46.546
BANANAS AND CHOCOLATE BARS AND

05:46.546 --> 05:48.415
THINGS LIKE THAT.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.950
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

05:49.950 --> 05:53.720
PAST WEEK BUT THERE ARE SIGNS

05:53.720 --> 05:56.790
THAT THE MOOD IS SHIFTING, AND

05:56.790 --> 05:58.892
AS MORE COME IN.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.694
WE HAVE ABOUT I THINK 4,000 CAME

06:00.694 --> 06:03.897
IN, INTO MUNICH THIS MORNING.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.398
THEY'RE EXPECTING ANOTHER 7,000

06:05.398 --> 06:07.033
OR SO BY THE END OF THE DAY, AND

06:07.033 --> 06:09.436
THE GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID

06:09.436 --> 06:10.503
YESTERDAY THAT THERE COULD BE AS

06:10.503 --> 06:13.373
MANY AS 40,000 WHO COME IN THIS

06:13.373 --> 06:13.974
WEEKEND.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.175
THAT WOULD BE DOUBLE WHAT WE SAW

06:15.175 --> 06:15.976
LAST WEEKEND.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.011
SO THERE IS A BIT OF CONCERN

06:18.011 --> 06:20.146
HERE IN GERMANY THAT THE INFLUX

06:20.146 --> 06:21.081
WON'T STOP.

06:21.081 --> 06:21.848
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

06:21.848 --> 06:24.684
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON THE ANGELA

06:24.684 --> 06:26.119
MERKEL NOW?

06:26.119 --> 06:28.221
>> MERKEL IS HUGELY POPULAR.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.092
SHE HAS RECORD POPULARITY

06:32.092 --> 06:37.297
RATINGS, UNPRECEDENTED IN

06:37.297 --> 06:39.366
POSTWAR GERMANY.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.934
SO SHE'S IN A GOOD POSITION.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.969
THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS DOING

06:42.969 --> 06:43.837
WELL, AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

06:43.837 --> 06:45.338
THE REASONS, ONE OF THE MAIN

06:45.338 --> 06:47.207
REASONS SHE CAN DO THIS.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.309
BUT I SPOKE WITH ONE OF HER TOP

06:49.309 --> 06:52.545
ADVISERS ON THURSDAY, AND THAT

06:52.545 --> 06:54.514
PERSON SAID THAT THE MOOD CAN

06:54.514 --> 06:55.515
SHIFT VERY QUICKLY.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.884
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING ATTACKS

06:57.884 --> 06:59.719
FROM HER CONSERVATIVE SISTER

06:59.719 --> 07:01.521
PARTY, THE CHRISTIAN SOCIAL

07:01.521 --> 07:02.856
UNION, WHICH IS BASED IF

07:02.856 --> 07:03.556
BAVARIA.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.324
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE

07:04.324 --> 07:07.427
REFUGEES ARE COMING IN.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.528
SHE HAS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

07:08.528 --> 07:10.530
THE MOOD SHIFTING, CERTAINLY.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.197
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

07:11.197 --> 07:12.599
THERE WERE ALSO STORIES TODAY

07:12.599 --> 07:14.267
ABOUT MARCHES ALL ACROSS EUROPE

07:14.267 --> 07:16.503
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE REFUGEES.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.704
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.606
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.175
WE SAW MERKEL WELCOME THESE

07:22.175 --> 07:24.377
REFUGEES WITH OPEN ARMS, SCENES

07:24.377 --> 07:27.480
OF HER TAKING-- REFUGEES TAKING

07:27.480 --> 07:28.882
SELFIES WITH HER WHEN SHE

07:28.882 --> 07:32.986
VISITED A SHELTER THIS WEEK.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.056
AND THAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD AN

07:36.056 --> 07:37.924
EFFECT ON THE REST OF EUROPE.

07:37.924 --> 07:41.061
THERE WAS A FRENCH MAGAZINE THAT

07:41.061 --> 07:42.662
PUT A BIG PICTURE OF AMERICA ON

07:42.662 --> 07:44.531
ITS COVER THIS WEEK AND SAID,

07:44.531 --> 07:46.333
"IF ONLY SHE WERE FRENCH."

07:46.333 --> 07:48.501
SO THERE IS A BIT OF AN

07:48.501 --> 07:51.237
OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY TOWARDS

07:51.237 --> 07:53.173
THE REFUGEES, I THINK PARTLY

07:53.173 --> 07:55.875
BECAUSE GERMANY HAS BEEN SO

07:55.875 --> 07:57.010
WELCOMING, BUT THERE ARE OTHER

07:57.010 --> 07:59.379
COUNTRIES -- HUNGARY, FOR

07:59.379 --> 08:00.814
EXAMPLE-- WHICH IS PUSHING THE

08:00.814 --> 08:02.148
REFUGEES OUT AS FAST AS THEY

08:02.148 --> 08:02.449
CAN.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.383
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE LONGER

08:03.383 --> 08:05.585
TERM PICTURES, DO YOU SEE

08:05.585 --> 08:07.687
GERMANY EMBRACING THESE REFUGEES

08:07.687 --> 08:09.255
AS PERHAPS THE FUTURE OF THEIR

08:09.255 --> 08:09.622
ECONOMY?

08:09.622 --> 08:10.924
I MEAN, THESE ARE YOUNG,

08:10.924 --> 08:11.958
SOMETIMES VERY SKILLED PEOPLE

08:11.958 --> 08:12.959
THAT ARE COMING IN.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.328
>> Reporter: WELL, THAT'S THE

08:15.328 --> 08:16.363
BIG QUESTION.

08:16.363 --> 08:20.367
I MEAN, GERMANY DOES HAVE A

08:20.367 --> 08:22.035
HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.937
THERE WERE LOTS OF TURKS,

08:23.937 --> 08:26.539
GREEKS, ITALIANS WHO CAME AFTER

08:26.539 --> 08:28.108
WORLD WAR II TO HELP REBUILD THE

08:28.108 --> 08:28.475
ECONOMY.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.643
SO THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF

08:30.643 --> 08:32.912
GERMANS HAVE IN THEIR-- YOU

08:32.912 --> 08:34.214
KNOW, THEY HEARD AROUND THE

08:34.214 --> 08:37.650
DINNER TABLE WHEN YOUNG.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.786
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK

08:39.786 --> 08:41.721
THE KEY THINGS ARE IF GERMANS

08:41.721 --> 08:43.857
FEEL THE GOVERNMENT HAS THIS

08:43.857 --> 08:45.792
UNDER CONTROL, IT'S TOO EARLY TO

08:45.792 --> 08:47.560
SAY WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SEE--

08:47.560 --> 08:48.862
WHETHER THIS SAME SORT OF

08:48.862 --> 08:49.863
ACCEPTANCE IS GOING TO BE HERE

08:49.863 --> 08:50.897
IN A FEW MONTHS.

08:50.897 --> 08:54.300
WE HAVE THE WINTER COMING, AND

08:54.300 --> 08:55.735
THE AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO

08:55.735 --> 08:57.670
HAVE TO FIND WINTER-PROOF

08:57.670 --> 08:58.505
SHELTERS FOR THESE REFUGEES.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.273
IF THEY DON'T, IF THEY'RE UNABLE

09:00.273 --> 09:02.776
TO DO THAT AND IT'S A HUGE TASK,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.844
THEN YOU COULD SEE THE MOOD

09:04.844 --> 09:05.612
BEGINNING TO SHIFT.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.246
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:06.246 --> 09:07.380
NOAH BARKIN OF REUTERS JOINING

09:07.380 --> 09:08.681
US LIVE FROM GERMANY TONIGHT,

09:08.681 --> 09:10.417
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.351
>> THANK YOU.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.553
>> Sreenivasan: IN INDIA, A P

09:13.553 --> 09:14.721

STUART SAYS SHE NEEDED HELP BUT

14:20.993 --> 14:21.661
NEVER FOUND ANYONE SHE COULD

14:21.661 --> 14:23.096
TRUST.

14:23.096 --> 14:23.963
HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE

14:23.963 --> 14:25.898
TREATED ALONG THE WAY?

14:25.898 --> 14:28.367

14:28.367 --> 14:29.135
ATTITUDE OF, "YOU'RE NOT GOING

14:29.135 --> 14:31.104
TO MAKE IT ANYWAYS."

14:31.104 --> 14:33.973
SO, I STARTED BELIEVING IT.

14:33.973 --> 14:34.907
BACK THEN I WAS LIKE, "I AIN'T

14:34.907 --> 14:35.575
GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.509
I'M GOING TO GET LOCKED UP

14:36.509 --> 14:37.210
ANYWAYS."

14:37.210 --> 14:39.912
DOING STUFF I WASN'T SUPPOSED

14:39.912 --> 14:40.913
TO, I'D DO IT AT THE DROP OF A

14:40.913 --> 14:42.014
DIME, BECAUSE EVERYONE MADE ME

14:42.014 --> 14:42.882
FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT- THAT'S

14:42.882 --> 14:44.250
ALL I WAS WORTH.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.651
>> Reporter: JUVENILE DETENTION

14:47.386 --> 14:48.154
EXPECTATIONS, EVEN WHEN SHE WAS

14:48.154 --> 14:49.822
RELEASED.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.357
>> I SAID, "OKAY, I'M LEAVING.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.291
Y'ALL WON'T SEE ME AGAIN.""

14:52.291 --> 14:53.459
NO, YOU'LL BE BACK."

14:53.459 --> 14:54.227
THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF THEY

14:54.227 --> 14:54.827
TOLD US.

14:54.827 --> 14:55.695
YOU KNOW?"

14:55.695 --> 14:57.964
YOU'LL BE BACK."

14:57.964 --> 14:59.766
>> Reporter: AND SHE WAS-- BY

14:59.766 --> 15:01.801
HER COUNT AROUND SIX TIMES.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.302
SO HER PROBATION OFFICER

15:03.302 --> 15:04.704
RECOMMENDED HER CASE BE

15:04.704 --> 15:05.505
TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW GIRLS

15:05.505 --> 15:07.039
COURT.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.674
IT WAS LAUNCHED BY JUDGE DAVID

15:19.018 --> 15:20.953
>> WHAT WE SEE OFTEN TIMES WHEN

15:20.953 --> 15:23.523
THE GIRLS HAVE HAD A TRAUMATIC

15:23.523 --> 15:24.957
EXPERIENCE SHE DOESN'T ALWAYS

15:24.957 --> 15:26.159
HAVE A VOCABULARY TO EXPLAIN

15:26.159 --> 15:28.761
WHAT'S GOING ON.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.198
AND SO, SHE WILL ACT OUT.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.533

15:34.667 --> 15:36.102

15:37.370 --> 15:38.738
JACKSONVILLE AND ACROSS THE

15:38.738 --> 15:40.173

15:40.173 --> 15:41.874
SLOWLY FOR GIRLS.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.076
RESEARCH SUGGESTS ZERO-TOLERANCE

15:44.076 --> 15:46.012

15:46.012 --> 15:48.748
POLICING OF THINGS LIKE FIGHTS

15:48.748 --> 15:49.549
AT HOME HAVE IMPACTED GIRLS MORE

15:49.549 --> 15:51.551
THAN BOYS.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.253
>> OFTEN, THE SYSTEM'S RESPONSE

15:54.253 --> 15:56.956
IS TO PUSH GIRLS AWAY, BY

15:56.956 --> 15:58.758
PUNISHING THEM, AND NOT GETTING

15:58.758 --> 15:59.759
TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT'S

15:59.759 --> 16:01.527
DRIVING THE BEHAVIOR.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.662
>> Reporter: TO BE CLEAR,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.030
THOUGH, I MEAN, A LOT OF THESE

16:04.030 --> 16:05.798
GIRLS HAVE COMMITTED SERIOUS

16:05.798 --> 16:06.833
CRIMES AND THEY DO NEED TO BE

16:06.833 --> 16:07.567
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

16:07.567 --> 16:08.067
BEHAVIOR.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.168
RIGHT?

16:09.168 --> 16:10.269
>> ABSOLUTELY.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.571
WE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY

16:11.571 --> 16:12.772
THAT GIRLS MUST BE HELD

16:12.772 --> 16:14.574
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIORS.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.410
BUT THAT HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH

16:17.410 --> 16:18.444
RECOGNIZING WHERE WE HAVE FAILED

16:18.444 --> 16:21.314
TO INTERVENE EARLY.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.648
>> Reporter: EARLIER

16:22.648 --> 16:23.382
INTERVENTION MAY HAVE HELPED MIA

16:23.382 --> 16:25.218
PAZ.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.353
AS A TEEN IN ORLANDO SHE CYCLED

16:32.892 --> 16:33.793
THERE WAS POSSESSION OF

16:33.793 --> 16:35.561
MARIJUANA.

16:35.561 --> 16:36.162
I ALSO HAD POSSESSION OF

16:36.162 --> 16:38.598
ALCOHOL.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.833
I HAD FLEEING AND ELUDING, A COP

16:40.833 --> 16:42.869
CHASE, A CAR CHASE.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.070
>> Reporter: PAZ BELIEVES SHE

16:44.070 --> 16:44.837
WAS ACTING OUT BECAUSE OF TRAUMA

16:44.837 --> 16:46.472
AT HOME.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.007
SHE SAYS HER UNCLE BEGAN TO

16:48.007 --> 16:48.741
SEXUALLY ABUSE HER WHEN SHE WAS

16:48.741 --> 16:51.711
IN SEVENTH GRADE.

16:51.711 --> 16:52.745
>> IT STARTED JUST, LIKE, VERY

16:52.745 --> 16:56.482
AWKWARD AND WEIRD QUESTIONS.

16:56.482 --> 16:57.917
AND THEN FEELING WEIRD FROM ALL-

16:57.917 --> 16:59.285
UN-UNWANTED TOUCHING.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.387
AND THEN IT WASN'T UNTIL I

17:01.387 --> 17:03.422
THOUGHT, "NO, I DON'T WANT TO DO

17:03.422 --> 17:06.058
THAT," THEN IT WAS MORE VIOLENT.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.260
>> Reporter: SHE BEGAN GETTING

17:07.260 --> 17:08.194
INTO TROUBLE, DRINKING AND USING

17:08.194 --> 17:10.062
DRUGS WITH HER FRIENDS.

17:10.062 --> 17:10.963
>> DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS

17:10.963 --> 17:16.235
BEING ABUSED I WAS REALLY TRYING

17:16.235 --> 17:16.903
TO AVOID BEING AT HOME.

17:16.903 --> 17:17.937
IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS SMOKING POT

17:17.937 --> 17:19.205
BECAUSE I WAS BORED.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.406
FOR ME, IT WAS BECAUSE I- I WAS

17:20.406 --> 17:21.407
SELF-MEDICATING.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.775
I WOULD RATHER BE HIGH THAN

17:22.775 --> 17:25.311
THINK ABOUT THE TWO HOURS UNTIL

17:25.311 --> 17:26.345
I GO HOME KIND OF THING.

17:26.345 --> 17:27.647
>> Reporter: PAZ SAYS SHE KEPT

17:27.647 --> 17:28.915
THE ABUSE SECRET, AND IT MADE

17:28.915 --> 17:30.249
HER DISTRUST AND FEAR ADULTS.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.952
ESPECIALLY THE POLICE.

17:32.952 --> 17:33.719

17:33.719 --> 17:35.655
DOG.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.124
I WOULD RUN.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.325
IT WAS THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT

17:39.325 --> 17:41.694
MENTALITY.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.828
WHEN YOU HAVE A POLICE OFFICER

17:42.828 --> 17:43.663
TALKING TO YOU, YOU CAN'T FIGHT

REHAB OR DETENTION.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.875

17:55.875 --> 17:57.143
I WAS VERY, VERY SCARED.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.411
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE THE GIRLS-

17:58.411 --> 17:59.512
LIKE, I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS

17:59.512 --> 18:00.379
THE TOUGHEST OF MY FRIENDS.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.547
AND HERE I AM IN A GROUP FULL OF

21:02.027 --> 21:03.629
MIGHT BE.

>> Reporter: THE TEAM GOT STUART

COUNSELING AT THE POLICY CENTER

21:06.432 --> 21:07.133
AND INTO THE PACE CENTER FOR

21:07.133 --> 21:08.534
GIRLS.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.569
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND CHILD

21:10.569 --> 21:11.203
CARE FOR HER TWO-YEAR-OLD

21:11.203 --> 21:12.872
DAUGHTER.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.507
>> YOU'RE MORE ARTICULATE THAN A

21:14.507 --> 21:16.375
LOT OF THE LAWYERS I HEAR.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.744
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.412
>> Reporter: FOR THE FIRST TIME,

21:20.412 --> 21:22.314
STUART SAYS, SHE HAS HOPE.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.383

21:24.383 --> 21:25.084
IT NO MORE, THEY CONTINUOUSLY

21:25.084 --> 21:28.888
PUSH ME."

21:28.888 --> 21:29.688
NO, YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

REMEMBER, YOU GOT A BABY.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.390
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.526
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP."

21:33.526 --> 21:35.094
SO, THEN I START THINKING LIKE

21:35.094 --> 21:36.328
THAT. EVEN WHEN I WANT TO THROW

21:36.328 --> 21:37.163
IN THE TOWEL, I HAVE TO TELL

21:37.163 --> 21:38.164
MYSELF, "NO, I CAN'T.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.166
I CAN'T."

ONGOING MIGRANT AND REFUGEE

22:05.090 --> 22:05.791
CRISIS.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.793
>> THEY JUST THROW FOOD AT US

22:07.793 --> 22:10.930
AND SAY TO US, "STAY, STAY."

22:33.752 --> 22:35.688
INSTITUTE FEATURES 250 ARTIFACTS

22:35.688 --> 22:37.056
FROM A PAIR OF ANCIENT CITIES

22:37.056 --> 22:39.992
DISCOVERED 15 YEARS AGO.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.560
IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS OF

22:41.560 --> 22:43.429
UNDERWATER EXCAVATION TO

22:43.429 --> 22:45.130
RETRIEVE THE ARTIFACTS FROM A 40

22:45.130 --> 22:46.565
SQUARE MILE AREA OF THE

22:46.565 --> 22:47.466
MEDITERRANEAN SEA NEAR

22:47.466 --> 22:49.235
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.869
THE OBJECTS, COVERED IN SEDIMENT

HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING.

22:59.278 --> 23:00.312
SOME OBJECTS CAME OUT OF THE

23:00.312 --> 23:01.981
WATER ONLY LAST YEAR.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.749
THE FRENCH MARINE ARCHAEOLOGIST

23:03.749 --> 23:05.317
WHO DISCOVERED THE CITIES

23:05.317 --> 23:06.585
BELIEVES THEY BECAME SUBMERGED

23:06.585 --> 23:09.722
1,200 YEARS AGO.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.723
>> (translated): THE CITIES

23:10.723 --> 23:12.191
WERE SUBMERGED BECAUSE OF

23:12.191 --> 23:13.792
NATURAL CALAMITIES, EARTHQUAKES,

23:13.792 --> 23:15.828
BIG TIDES, COLLAPSING OF GROUND,

23:15.828 --> 23:16.762
WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE THAT SEA

23:16.762 --> 23:18.030
COULD COVER THOSE SITES.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.431
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

23:19.431 --> 23:21.834
BIGGEST FINDS IS THIS 30-FOOT

23:21.834 --> 23:23.435
STATUE OF A PHARAOH, WHICH THE

23:23.435 --> 23:24.570
ARCHAEOLOGISTS BELIEVE, STOOD AT

23:24.570 --> 23:25.571
THE ENTRANCE TO A TEMPLE NOW

23:25.571 --> 23:27.539
UNDERWATER.

23:27.539 --> 23:33.712
THE ANCIENT CITIES WERE CALLED

23:33.712 --> 23:34.480
THONIS, HERACLEION AND CANOPUS.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.581
MANY OF THE ARTIFACTS ARE

23:35.581 --> 23:36.615
THOUGHT TO BE IN TRIBUTE TO THE

23:36.615 --> 23:37.583
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN GOD, OSIRIS.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.584
>> (translated): THE ARTIFACTS

23:38.584 --> 23:39.685
HAVE AESTHETIC VALUE, BUT AT THE

23:39.685 --> 23:40.853
SAME TIME, THIS SHOWS US THERE

23:40.853 --> 23:42.721
IS A CONTINUITY IN EGYPTIAN

23:42.721 --> 23:43.856
BELIEFS FROM THE ANCIENT PHARAOH

23:43.856 --> 23:44.590
CIVILIZATION AND TO GREEK AND

23:44.590 --> 23:45.958
ROMAN TIMES.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.694
WE HAVE OSIRIS, WHO BECAME

23:48.694 --> 23:49.361
DIONYSUS AND THEN BACCHUS IN

23:49.361 --> 23:50.729
ROMAN TIMES.

23:50.729 --> 23:51.997
>> Sreenivasan: THE EXHIBIT

23:51.997 --> 23:53.599
COMES AT A PRECARIOUS TIME FOR

23:53.599 --> 23:55.034
ANTIQUITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

23:55.034 --> 23:56.669
AS MILITANTS FROM THE ISLAMIC

23:56.669 --> 23:58.537
STATE, OR ISIS, HAVE DESTROYED

23:58.537 --> 24:02.474
ARTIFACTS ACROSS IRAQ AND SYRIA.

24:02.474 --> 24:03.275
>> (translated): WE WANT TO

24:03.275 --> 24:04.143
SAY THAT NO, WE SHOULD TAKE CARE

24:04.143 --> 24:05.210
OF THE WORLD HERITAGE BECAUSE IN

24:05.210 --> 24:06.178
REALITY IT IS NOT ONLY OUR

24:06.178 --> 24:07.179
HERITAGE ONLY, IT IS THE WORLD'S

24:07.179 --> 24:07.680
