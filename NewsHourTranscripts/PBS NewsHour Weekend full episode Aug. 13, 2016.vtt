18:31.844 --> 18:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF YEARS AGO, MANDATORY MINIMUM

18:34.380 --> 18:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENTENCES WHICH SET A FLOOR FOR

18:36.616 --> 18:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:48.928 --> 18:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, AFTER A RISK-BENEFIT

18:51.297 --> 18:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANALYSIS, THAT IT MAKES MUCH

18:52.565 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE SENSE TO PLEAD GUILTY AND

18:53.866 --> 18:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THEIR RISKS AT PERHAPS

18:56.369 --> 18:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:58.170 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GO TO TRIAL AND ARE

18:59.739 --> 19:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ENDLESS AMOUNT OF JURY TRIALS

19:08.080 --> 19:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:14.720 --> 19:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDGES, IS THAT SO MUCH IN THE

19:15.721 --> 19:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT

19:18.024 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN IN PUBLIC BUT THE ONE

19:19.358 --> 19:21.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING THAT DOES IS A TRIAL.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN YOU SEE A CRIMINAL

19:22.194 --> 19:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIAL BEFORE A JURY, EVERYTHING

19:24.230 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS OUT THERE.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT'S EVIDENCE IS

19:26.098 --> 19:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTED.

19:26.432 --> 19:30.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEFENSE, OF COURSE, GETS ITS

19:30.569 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST SHOT.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PUBLIC GETS TO SEE WHAT'S

19:32.338 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY

19:33.439 --> 19:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I HAVE SEEN THIS IN RECENT

19:35.674 --> 19:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL CORRUPTION TRIALS, FOR

19:37.443 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT

19:38.577 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT TO LAY OUT THE EVIDENCE IT

19:39.912 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS BRINGING.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT TRIALS, WITH ONLY PLEAS,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLEA BARGAINS, MUCH OF THAT

19:44.483 --> 19:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND

19:45.951 --> 19:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERAL JUDGES TO ME SAID IT'S

19:47.319 --> 19:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT AS THE

19:48.487 --> 19:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF TRIALS DISAPPEAR, THE

19:51.023 --> 19:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLIC NATURE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN

19:52.925 --> 19:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURTHOUSE ALSO VANISHES.

19:54.126 --> 19:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: IS THE CONCERN

19:54.794 --> 19:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS JUST TIPS THE BALANCE

19:56.228 --> 19:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WELL, TOO MUCH IN FAVOR OF

19:58.364 --> 19:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTIONS BECAUSE THEIR

19:59.432 --> 20:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE NEVER REALLY GETS

20:00.933 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCRUTINIZED IN COURT?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT,

20:02.835 --> 20:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE'S A DEBATE.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTORS BRING CASES, AND

20:06.639 --> 20:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY BRING

20:08.074 --> 20:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY THE STRONGEST CASES, THE

20:09.708 --> 20:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN

20:10.943 --> 20:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIN AT TRIAL.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENSE LAWYERS OFTEN FEEL FROM

20:13.446 --> 20:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT

20:14.814 --> 20:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY MAKES SENSE FOR THEIR

20:16.248 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENDANT TO PLEAD GUILTY IF

20:17.116 --> 20:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY REALLY THINK THEY'RE GOING

20:18.117 --> 20:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET CONVICTED AT TRIAL.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO SOME EXTENT, THE NUMBER

20:21.987 --> 20:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PLEAS THAT ARE HAMMERED OUT

20:24.156 --> 20:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO KEEP MOVING

20:25.658 --> 20:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORWARD.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT IS A FACT THAT THERE ARE

20:28.494 --> 20:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEWER CRIMINAL JURY TRIALS, AND

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS NUMBER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

20:32.031 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING DOWN OVER THE LAST 20,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HITTER, 40 YEARS.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST HAPPENS THAT IN THE

MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE

20:36.802 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I'VE BEEN COVERING IT

20:39.438 --> 20:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMED PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED

20:40.406 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN RECENT MONTHS, AND I BEGAN

20:41.540 --> 20:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASKING ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.

>> Brangham: ONE OF THE

20:43.576 --> 20:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGATIVES OF THIS, AS YOU QUOTE

20:46.112 --> 20:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN YOUR STORY, A LOT OF FEDERAL

20:47.480 --> 20:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDGES JUST FEEL THEIR JOBS ARE

20:49.081 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLY BORING.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ARE THERE OTHER UP SIDES TO

20:52.852 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, NOT HAVING SO MANY TRIALS?

20:54.453 --> 20:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DEFENDANT A PLEA TO PERHAPS ONE

20:58.691 --> 20:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:59.892 --> 21:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CASE WE WROTE ABOUT, A

21:02.661 --> 21:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE,

21:04.196 --> 21:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWS A DEFENDANT NOT TO SPEND

AS MUCH TIME IN PRISON AS HE

21:07.399 --> 21:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE HAD HE GONE TO TRIAL

21:09.034 --> 21:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BEEN CONVICTED.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:11.303 --> 21:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DEFENSE LAWYER WHO I QUOTED

21:14.840 --> 21:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS DEFENDANT
