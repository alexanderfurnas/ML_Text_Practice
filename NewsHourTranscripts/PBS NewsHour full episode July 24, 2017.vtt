JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.333 --> 00:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.533 --> 00:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED KUSHNER, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
I didn't collude with
Russia, nor did I know

00:10.400 --> 00:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of anyone else in the
campaign who did so.

00:13.300 --> 00:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump's son-in-law and senior
adviser, Jared Kushner, defends

00:18.033 --> 00:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contacts with Russian officials
as he meets with the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, I sit down with Democratic
National Committee Chair Tom
Perez to talk the party's

00:29.533 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new agenda, while our Politics
Monday team take on that,
health care and the president's

00:34.033 --> 00:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new communications director.

00:36.233 --> 00:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus: living in limbo --
on an isolated coast off
Bangladesh, hundreds of
thousands of Myanmar's

00:43.133 --> 00:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rohingya people have relocated
to escape persecution, only
to face new challenges.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DILBAR, Refugee (through
translator): We came here,
left our homes, rice.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We came here to save our lives.

00:55.166 --> 00:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we have no peace,
then it's better to die.

00:58.366 --> 01:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:01.633 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.933 --> 01:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Denial and
defense, the president's
son-in-law offered both
today in the Russia

01:19.166 --> 01:21.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke privately for members
of the U.S. Senate staff and
briefly publicly for news

01:25.900 --> 01:27.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cameras.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our coverage begins
with John Yang.

01:29.333 --> 01:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Outside the White
House West Wing, Jared Kushner
did something he rarely does:

01:36.333 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speak to reporters.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JARED KUSHNER, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
Let me be very clear.

01:40.133 --> 01:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did not collude with Russia,
nor do I know of anyone else
in the campaign who did so.

01:46.433 --> 01:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had no improper contacts.

01:49.033 --> 01:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He dismissed the
idea that his father-in-law
benefited from Russian meddling

01:53.766 --> 01:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the election.

01:55.833 --> 01:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED KUSHNER: Donald Trump
had a better message and ran a
smarter campaign and that is why

02:00.800 --> 02:03.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he won.

02:03.366 --> 02:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Suggesting otherwise ridicules
those who voted for him.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kushner
took no questions from
reporters, but said he
had answered all questions

02:13.933 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Senate Intelligence
Committee investigators in a
two-hour closed-door session.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His 11-page prepared
remarks gave the first
public explanation of
four meetings he had

02:24.433 --> 02:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Russians during the
campaign and transition.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he didn't know the
purpose of the June 9, 2016,
meeting Donald Trump Jr. set

02:33.733 --> 02:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up with Russian attorney Natalia
Veselnitskaya, campaign chairman
Paul Manafort and others

02:38.333 --> 02:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in hopes of getting
dirt on Hillary Clinton.

02:40.433 --> 02:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner said he arrived late
and "quickly determined that
my time wasn't well-spent.

02:47.633 --> 02:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was," he said, "a
waste of our time," a
judgment his brother-in-law
has also expressed.

02:53.233 --> 02:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: It was literally just
a wasted 20 minutes, which

02:53.933 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a shame.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Less than a month
after President Trump won the
election, on December 1, Kushner

03:02.400 --> 03:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and national security
adviser-designate Michael
Flynn met with Russian
ambassador, Sergey

03:04.866 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kislyak.

03:06.866 --> 03:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to Kushner, the envoy
said he wanted to talk about
Syria and convey information

03:12.300 --> 03:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from his generals.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kislyak asked if there
was a secure line in
the transition office.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Told that there wasn't, Kushner
asked if the Russians had an
existing communications channel

03:22.400 --> 03:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at his embassy we could use.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The ambassador said that
wouldn't be possible.

03:27.933 --> 03:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On December 13, Kushner met,
at Kislyak's insistence, with
Sergey Gorkov, the head of

03:34.133 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a Russian bank that is
under U.S. sanctions.

03:36.933 --> 03:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said Gorkov told him he
was friendly with President
Putin and expressed hopes for a

03:43.033 --> 03:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better relationship
in the future.

03:44.666 --> 03:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kushner said he has not been
in contact with Gorkov since.

03:48.466 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for the matter of Kushner's
original security clearance
application not including any of

03:53.066 --> 03:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his foreign contacts, the
president's son-in-law
said it was an accident.

03:57.966 --> 04:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said it was submitted
prematurely due to
a miscommunication
with an assistant.

04:04.133 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been updated at
least three times.

04:07.133 --> 04:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Sunday, the White House
appeared ready to accept a new
sanctions bill scheduled for

04:11.400 --> 04:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a House vote tomorrow.

04:13.466 --> 04:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would target Russia and
limit Mr. Trump's ability
to lift the penalties.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White
House Press Secretary: We
support where the legislation

04:18.633 --> 04:20.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is now.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will continue working with
the House and Senate to put
those tough sanctions in place.

04:23.866 --> 04:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But late today,
White House Press Secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the

04:27.600 --> 04:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president is still studying
the legislation, which was
introduced because of questions

04:32.200 --> 04:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
raised by the Russia
investigation, which has
now entered a new phase.

04:39.133 --> 04:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner will be back on Capitol
Hill tomorrow for a private
session with members of the

04:42.266 --> 04:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House Intelligence Committee.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

04:46.366 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
said later that President
Trump was -- quote -- "very

04:50.000 --> 04:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proud" of his son-in-law's
actions today.

04:52.366 --> 04:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will go deeper on all of this
right after the news summary.

04:56.133 --> 05:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Trump directed
new criticism at his
own attorney over the

05:01.033 --> 05:03.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russia probe.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a tweet, he called Jeff
Sessions "our beleaguered
A.G." and asked why
he and others are not

05:08.466 --> 05:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigating Hillary Clinton.

05:10.733 --> 05:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, the president
openly chastised Sessions for
recusing himself in the Russia

05:16.266 --> 05:18.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A diplomatic standoff
between Israel and Jordan
ended this evening.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It had begun Sunday, when an
Israeli Embassy guard in Amman
killed two Jordanians after

05:26.566 --> 05:28.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one stabbed him.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Jordanians said they wanted
to question the guard, but
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

05:32.766 --> 05:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Netanyahu insisted he has
diplomatic immunity and
must be returned home.

05:39.866 --> 05:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU,
Israeli Prime Minister
(through translator):
I assured him that we

05:41.933 --> 05:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will see to bringing
him back to Israel.

05:44.033 --> 05:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are also holding contacts to
end the incident and to bring
our people back to Israel.

05:48.066 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are doing this
determinedly and responsibly.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the
guard and other embassy
staffers returned to Israel.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The dispute added to tensions
over new security measures at
the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

06:02.666 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They sparked protests
on Friday, and several
Palestinians were killed.

06:06.633 --> 06:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Afghanistan, at least 24
people were killed today when a
suicide car bomber rammed a bus

06:12.566 --> 06:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
carrying government employees.

06:14.566 --> 06:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Taliban said it was behind
the attack targeting a Kabul
neighborhood that's home

06:19.200 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to leading politicians.

06:20.833 --> 06:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least 42 people were hurt.

06:23.300 --> 06:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, in Lahore, Pakistan,
a suicide bomber killed at
least 25 people, many of

06:28.900 --> 06:30.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them police.

06:30.133 --> 06:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Pakistani Taliban
claimed that attack.

06:33.300 --> 06:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philippines President Rodrigo
Duterte insisted today he will
continue a drug crackdown that's

06:39.666 --> 06:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
claimed thousands of lives.

06:41.633 --> 06:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a state of the union address,
he called the victims beasts
and vultures and he vowed

06:47.633 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he'd go to prison
first before giving in.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: The fight will not
stop until those who deal in

06:56.666 --> 07:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it understand that they have
to cease, they have to stop,
because the alternative are

07:05.233 --> 07:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
either jail or hell.

07:07.700 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Duterte
spoke, thousands of
left-wing protesters
marched in opposition.

07:14.866 --> 07:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He met with them later,
but warned he will order
police to shoot anyone
who causes disturbances.

07:21.833 --> 07:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Poland, the country's
president broke with
his own political party
today, vetoing two

07:28.000 --> 07:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bills aimed at curbing the
independence of judges.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The legislation had triggered
mass demonstrations.

07:33.566 --> 07:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Diana Magnay of
Independent Television
News filed this report.

07:37.266 --> 07:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANA MAGNAY: For days
and long into each
night, they protested
in cities across Poland

07:44.233 --> 07:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against judicial reforms they
felt might snuff out what's
left of liberal democracy here.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a phrase the ruling
Law and Justice Party had much
track with, certainly not party

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

07:56.900 --> 08:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the man he cherry-picked
for president last year, Andrzej
Duda, just broke with party

08:02.866 --> 08:04.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ranks.

08:04.966 --> 08:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRZEJ DUDA, President of
Poland (through translator):
Poland badly needs reform of

08:07.400 --> 08:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the judiciary and I fully
support this reform.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I support a smart reform,
which would guarantee an
effective functioning of the

08:14.266 --> 08:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judiciary and improve the
sense of justice in Poland.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Cue an emergency
meeting of the ruling party.

08:20.733 --> 08:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No comments from the press,
but expect the president, who
until now has signed pretty

08:24.900 --> 08:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much everything that's crossed
his desk, to put his stamp on
any new piece of legislation,

08:31.733 --> 08:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely some kind of compromise,
on reforms his party says
they have a mandate for.

08:35.233 --> 08:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIK TARCZYNSKI, Member
of Polish Parliament: So
far, the judges in Poland
had no responsibility

08:39.866 --> 08:42.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We as members of Parliament
can be, I don't know, put on
trial or lose our mandate or

08:47.166 --> 08:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just people revolt
and decide our future.

08:49.666 --> 08:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we wanted to have very
equal rights for everyone, for
member of the Parliament, for

08:56.533 --> 08:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the judge, and from
the man on the street.

08:58.566 --> 09:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Some on the street
today felt their president
hadn't gone far enough, blocking

09:02.500 --> 09:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two pieces of legislation,
but not a third, which grants
sweeping powers to the justice

09:09.066 --> 09:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
minister, including the
right to appoint the
heads of lower courts.

09:11.633 --> 09:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This evening, another
demonstration outside
the presidential palace
by those whose notions

09:18.400 --> 09:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of law and justice are
entirely different from
Kaczynski and his ruling party.

09:21.366 --> 09:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That report
from Diana Magnay of
Independent Television News.

09:26.033 --> 09:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The parents of a critically
ill baby in Britain
have dropped their legal
bid to keep him alive.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They'd been trying to move
11-month-old Charlie Gard to the
U.S. for experimental treatment,

09:37.366 --> 09:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but British doctors
argued it wouldn't work.

09:39.833 --> 09:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the father, Chris Gard,
said they have made their
decision after new tests showed

09:44.466 --> 09:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the child's muscle damage
is now irreversible.

09:46.733 --> 09:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS GARD, Father: We will
have to live with the what-ifs
which will haunt us for the rest

09:51.133 --> 09:53.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of our lives.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Despite the way our
beautiful son has been
spoken about sometimes,
as if he is not worthy

09:59.333 --> 10:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a chance of life, our son
is an absolute warrior, and
we could not be prouder of him

10:05.666 --> 10:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we will miss him terribly.

10:08.233 --> 10:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The case
has garnered international
attention, with both
President Trump and the

10:13.200 --> 10:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pope offering support
to the family.

10:15.266 --> 10:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump called for Senate
Republicans to begin debate on

10:19.800 --> 10:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a health care bill.

10:21.766 --> 10:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party leaders say they will try
advancing a measure tomorrow,
but it's not clear which

10:26.366 --> 10:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one: a version that repeals
and replaces Obamacare
or a repeal-only bill.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president said -- quote
-- "There's been enough talk.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now is the time for action."

10:37.033 --> 10:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
nearly 67 points to close at

10:42.533 --> 10:44.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21513.

10:44.200 --> 10:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 23 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Jared Kushner's statement put
in context; what led to the

10:56.933 --> 10:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deaths of 10 migrants in
San Antonio; a controversial
plan to relocate ones
of the world's most

11:01.133 --> 11:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
persecuted minorities;
and much more.

11:16.433 --> 11:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the start of this week,
the latest focus of the Russia
investigations on Jared Kushner

11:23.433 --> 11:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has exposed new details of
the president son-in-law's
dealings with Moscow.

11:26.300 --> 11:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We break down what we know and
the key questions that remain
with special correspondent Nick

11:31.900 --> 11:33.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Schifrin.

11:33.366 --> 11:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Nick, you have spent the
day talking to a lot of people.

11:36.033 --> 11:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What comes out of this?

11:38.033 --> 11:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What new do we learn about
Jared Kushner and his
dealings with the Russians?

11:40.200 --> 11:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: I think the new
narrative is that this is the
senior adviser to a president

11:44.733 --> 11:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has questioned whether there
was any influence by Russia last
year detailing Russia influence

11:51.433 --> 11:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on him and perhaps
on Trump policy.

11:54.866 --> 11:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And nobody in this
administration has
really done that before.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have got three
examples of that laid out.

12:00.433 --> 12:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is Ambassador Kislyak, the
former Russian ambassador to
the United States, asking for

12:04.900 --> 12:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a direct line between the
Trump transition team and
Russian generals on Syria.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is very unusual.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kislyak could have asked the
Obama administration, could have
used the U.S. government to do

12:18.700 --> 12:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so, and he would be
expected to do so.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he didn't do that.

12:21.566 --> 12:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tried to circumvent the
Obama administration and
use Kushner to do that.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secondly, Sergey Gorkov,
the banker that John
reported on, introduced
to Kushner as a personal

12:32.066 --> 12:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friend of Vladimir Putin, shows
up with two gifts, art and dirt.

12:37.733 --> 12:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of the people I
spoke to today, that metaphor
of dirt is not lost on them.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea, according to
the intelligence officials
I spoke to and former
diplomats, is to prove

12:47.666 --> 12:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Russia has a
connection to Kushner.

12:49.766 --> 12:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is dirt from Kushner's
grandparents' home in Belarus
and also perhaps to convince

12:55.833 --> 12:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kushner that Russia does
its homework on Kushner.

12:58.066 --> 13:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is someone who is kind
of part of the brotherhood,
if you will, of businessmen

13:02.666 --> 13:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with former intelligence ties,
who keep those intelligence
ties, and could therefore really

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
represent the Russian government
to Kushner, and reach out
to someone very close to the

13:14.033 --> 13:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign or President
Trump himself on behalf of
the Russian government, and,

13:17.233 --> 13:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
again, using Kushner to do that.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, thirdly, of course, the
meeting we have been talking
about for a few weeks now with

13:21.900 --> 13:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Natalia Veselnitskaya, this
lawyer who reached out to
Donald Trump Jr. and to Kushner.

13:25.966 --> 13:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have three examples
of Russia trying to literally
get into the Trump family.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those are the details
that we saw today.

13:33.500 --> 13:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this on
top of what we had learned
before this, is all related to

13:37.533 --> 13:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's happening in Congress,
the Senate, even Republicans
coming together with Democrats

13:43.733 --> 13:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to impose these new
sanctions on Russia.

13:46.333 --> 13:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's very
clear that Republicans are
helping lead this effort,
certainly bipartisan

13:49.933 --> 13:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
effort, but certainly
Republicans, fearing
the president's rhetoric
on Russia, responding

13:56.933 --> 13:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the president's rhetoric
on Russia, frankly handcuffing
the president on his ability to

13:59.966 --> 14:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lift sanctions on Russia that
were imposed because of Ukraine,
Eastern Ukraine and Crimea,

14:05.833 --> 14:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well as the 2016 elections.

14:07.866 --> 14:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Republicans wouldn't use
that word handcuff, but that
is really what these have done.

14:11.233 --> 14:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the first time U.S.
has penalized anyone
the U.S. believes was
part of the campaign

14:17.800 --> 14:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last year to influence
the elections directly.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not designed to
hit ordinary Russians.

14:23.333 --> 14:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's designed to send a message
to Russia that U.S. intelligence
knows who's doing these

14:28.800 --> 14:30.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it will make it harder for
banks and for other companies
-- or countries, rather, to

14:35.866 --> 14:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do business with Russia
perhaps in the future.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, Nick, you
talked to a lot of people today.

14:39.700 --> 14:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any sense that, as Jared
Kushner says, he's a babe in the
woods, he doesn't know American

14:44.533 --> 14:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politics, he doesn't know
diplomacy, that he really was
an unwitting figure in all this,

14:50.266 --> 14:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as he says he was?

14:52.366 --> 14:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Some of this
is described to me as normal,
whether it's Sergey Kislyak's

14:56.066 --> 15:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reaching out to someone who
was a neophyte, reaching out
to a campaign or a transition

15:02.100 --> 15:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
team that was brand-new
to Washington.

15:05.800 --> 15:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some people say, look,
this is what any diplomat, any
country would do with a new

15:10.000 --> 15:12.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

15:12.066 --> 15:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is not normal is that
the president has questioned
his intelligence community's

15:17.133 --> 15:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
findings about what
Russia has done.

15:19.166 --> 15:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is not normal is not to
report some of these meetings
that were set up with Russians,

15:25.366 --> 15:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Kushner admitted that
he failed to do initially.

15:27.733 --> 15:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's not normal is
not to report Ambassador
Kislyak's attempt to
circumvent the U.S. government

15:33.033 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and administration to try and
get to the Trump campaign.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's why there is so
much focus on this meeting.

15:37.433 --> 15:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
just a couple seconds,
Russian reactions to all this?

15:40.766 --> 15:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: You know,
what's interesting, their
focus is on sanctions.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They haven't replied to any
request for comment on Kushner.

15:47.133 --> 15:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that the sanctions
are -- quote -- "extremely
negative," if the
sanctions go forward from

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is their focus.

15:55.433 --> 15:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't want these
sanctions to go forward.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump himself has questioned
whether these sanctions
should go forward in the past.

16:03.933 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they do, that may be one
of the legacies of 2016, turning
Congress against Russia to

16:07.833 --> 16:09.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick Schifrin
doing a lot of reporting
on this, we thank you.

16:15.766 --> 16:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thank you.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest on
a human smuggling case in Texas
that has left at least 10 people

16:28.800 --> 16:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dead after they were packed into
a sweltering tractor-trailer.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And again to John Yang.

16:35.333 --> 16:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The truck
driver, James Bradley,
was charged in federal
court today with knowingly

16:40.600 --> 16:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transporting people who are in
the country illegally for money.

16:43.666 --> 16:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the criminal
complaint, a Wal-Mart
employee called police
early Sunday to report

16:48.333 --> 16:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the suspicious tractor-trailer
in the parking lot after
someone asked for water.

16:54.933 --> 16:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Officers found dozens
of people packed into
the sweltering trailer.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In addition to the
dead, nearly 20 others
are still hospitalized.

17:02.566 --> 17:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bradley told police he was
driving the tractor-trailer
from Iowa to a new owner
in Brownsville, Texas,

17:09.600 --> 17:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and wasn't aware of what or who
he was hauling until he stopped
at the Wal-Mart for a bathroom

17:14.866 --> 17:16.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
break.

17:16.966 --> 17:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Survivors said there was no
air conditioning and described
taking turns to breath through

17:20.200 --> 17:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hole in the trailer.

17:22.533 --> 17:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason Buch is covering the
story and reports on border and
immigration issues for The San

17:26.666 --> 17:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Antonio Express-News.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jason, thanks for joining us.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First, bring us up to date.

17:32.433 --> 17:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the latest today and
what did we learn from the truck
driver's appearance in court?

17:36.633 --> 17:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH, The San Antonio
Express-News: Well, there
wasn't a whole lot said in court

17:39.466 --> 17:41.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this morning.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going to be held until
a bond hearing on Thursday.

17:43.500 --> 17:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. Attorney's Office
signed off on a complaint
by immigration agents that

17:51.900 --> 17:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
detailed what they learned in
their interviews with the driver
and with the immigrants, and,

17:56.433 --> 18:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you described, this journey
up from the border in an
overheated container with a very

18:03.433 --> 18:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
limited ability to
get air from one hole.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talk about
the charges he's facing.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're federal charges.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the maximum penalty?

18:11.300 --> 18:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH: So, most smuggling
charges come with a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because people died
in this case, he actually
faces up to life in prison
or the death penalty.

18:23.933 --> 18:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had another incident here
about 15 years ago in which
several people died, 19 people

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
died after being
abandoned in a trailer.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death penalty was
overturned in that case, and
that driver got 34 years.

18:35.133 --> 18:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it would be difficult for
the U.S. Attorney's Office to
prove up a capital case here.

18:40.066 --> 18:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How widespread are
these smuggling operations?

18:43.733 --> 18:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can you tell us about them?

18:45.800 --> 18:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH: I mean, people
come across the border
in South Texas every day.

18:51.966 --> 18:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Border Patrol in Laredo,
which is where these folks
crossed, have reported in the

18:54.533 --> 18:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last couple months an uptick in
people using tractor-trailers
to try to get through the

19:01.033 --> 19:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Border Patrol checkpoint and
reach the cities to the north.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a long time
since we have had a
fatal incident like this
involving a tractor-trailer,

19:09.366 --> 19:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but certainly there have been
a number of incidents reported
by Border Patrol recently

19:13.566 --> 19:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of dozens of people packed
into tractor-trailers.

19:15.833 --> 19:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And tell us
how these operations work.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, these people, some
of the survivors said they
crossed the river actually on a

19:21.466 --> 19:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
raft and then they were
being taken farther
north in this truck?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they work in general?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Right.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what they described was
being -- paying a smuggler in
Mexico to bring them across

19:32.400 --> 19:34.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the border.

19:34.033 --> 19:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were then brought
to most likely stash
houses on the U.S. side.

19:37.033 --> 19:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when it was time to
load the truck, it appears that
people who were being smuggled

19:41.033 --> 19:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by different groups were
all brought to where
this trailer was parked,
loaded into the trailer,

19:48.066 --> 19:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then driven to Laredo.

19:50.166 --> 19:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in fact, they were
given -- each group
was given a different
color tape to determine

19:55.633 --> 19:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who they should go with when
they arrived in San Antonio.

19:59.033 --> 20:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the immigrants
described to investigators
that there were black
SUVs waiting for them

20:05.233 --> 20:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the Wal-Mart parking
lot when they pulled up.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And where they
would be taken after that?

20:08.966 --> 20:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where would these
SUVs take them?

20:11.266 --> 20:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Some people
said that they were
staying in San Antonio.

20:14.933 --> 20:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Others -- another person
interviewed by the
immigration agents said
that they were headed

20:19.466 --> 20:21.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Minnesota.

20:21.533 --> 20:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, San Antonio is a
pass-through because we're on
a major highway to the border.

20:25.733 --> 20:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People are usually going
on to major metropolitan
areas or regions of
the country that employ

20:30.666 --> 20:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of immigrant laborers,
so, areas with large agriculture
industries or construction

20:37.300 --> 20:39.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
booms.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And obviously,
business -- I'm sorry -- border
security, immigration issues

20:42.933 --> 20:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are a big topic, with
President Trump talking
about the border wall.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Has this incident
gotten swept up in the
politics of this issue?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Absolutely.

20:55.466 --> 21:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our lieutenant governor was
on Facebook yesterday blaming
this on sanctuary cities.

21:02.833 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our legislature recently passed
a bill that would provide
criminal penalties and fines

21:07.733 --> 21:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for officials who ran what
they call sanctuary cities.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the lieutenant governor was
placing blame for this incident
on cities and counties that

21:20.366 --> 21:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't cooperate with federal
immigration officials.

21:22.333 --> 21:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it's a
horrible, horrible incident,
reminds us of the people behind

21:26.733 --> 21:27.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these issues.

21:27.966 --> 21:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jason Buch, thanks so
much for joining us.

21:30.866 --> 21:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Thank you.

21:38.633 --> 21:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:43.266 --> 21:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
I sit down with Tom Perez, the
chair of the Democratic National

21:47.766 --> 21:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee; our Politics
Monday duo examines the
Democrats and the latest
White House controversies;

21:55.200 --> 22:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and a new film documents
the lives of Syrian
activists battling ISIS.

22:01.833 --> 22:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, first, we turn
to Bangladesh and the
plight of the Rohingya.

22:07.333 --> 22:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are an ethnic minority
group seeking refuge there,
many having been forced from

22:10.233 --> 22:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their homes in
neighboring Myanmar.

22:12.733 --> 22:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as special correspondent
Tania Rashid found,
they are hardly more
welcome in Bangladesh.

22:19.166 --> 22:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the tens of thousands, they
are stuck in a deadly limbo.

22:22.666 --> 22:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Parts of this
story may disturb some viewers.

22:26.300 --> 22:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: The island is
isolated, covered in bushes,
and underwater half of the year.

22:33.533 --> 22:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called Thenga Chor, and it
lies on the coast of Bangladesh.

22:38.133 --> 22:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a hard and long day's boat
ride from the nearest port.

22:41.733 --> 22:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This rough spot might be the
new home for the Rohingya,
a group of more than 300,000

22:48.400 --> 22:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people the U.N. calls
the most persecuted
minority in the world.

22:51.133 --> 22:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on a camp on the mainland,
Hafez, a Rohingya activist,
says that is no place they want

22:56.800 --> 22:58.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

22:58.766 --> 23:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ, Activist (through
translator): If we go to
Thenga Chor, we will get sick.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can die.

23:03.366 --> 23:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are used to being here,
and we feel safe here.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: It's
only a relative safety.

23:08.233 --> 23:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Close to half-a-million have
fled murder and persecution
by the army of Myanmar to seek

23:13.066 --> 23:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refuge in camps in
Southern Bangladesh.

23:16.266 --> 23:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Muslim Rohingya have
lived in mainly Buddhist
Myanmar for centuries,
but are viewed as illegal

23:22.433 --> 23:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ethnic Bangladeshis by
the Myanmar government.

23:24.433 --> 23:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The de facto leader of Myanmar,
Nobel peace laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, has denied a U.N.

23:30.533 --> 23:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charge of ethnic cleansing
of the Rohingya'.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the last eight months,
the numbers of Rohingya fleeing
for their lives have surged

23:39.333 --> 23:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to more than 70,000.

23:41.433 --> 23:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now their lives are more
precarious than ever before.

23:45.233 --> 23:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monsoon season and a
punishing cyclone damaged
many Rohingya settlements.

23:49.833 --> 23:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Bangladeshi government
plans to resolve the Rohingya's
continued displacement by moving

23:56.066 --> 23:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
60,000 of the refugees
to this remote island.

23:58.666 --> 24:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aid agencies like the UNHCR
and Human Rights Watch have
expressed alarm over the planned

24:04.966 --> 24:06.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relocation.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our journey to the
island was difficult.

24:08.566 --> 24:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We began a week
before the cyclone.

24:11.533 --> 24:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traveled first by ferry,
then by a private boat, where a
local fishermen agreed to take

24:17.266 --> 24:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us to the island.

24:18.966 --> 24:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a dangerous journey.

24:20.933 --> 24:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pirates are known to
control these seas and
take hostages for ransom.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the island is
not easy to access.

24:27.200 --> 24:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tides are too high on
the bigger ship, so we had to
get a smaller boat to take us

24:32.800 --> 24:33.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the island.

24:33.733 --> 24:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We just made it on the island.

24:40.233 --> 24:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We managed to find a muddy
bog to land near, and get
us across to the island.

24:43.233 --> 24:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government has already
moved forward with the plan of
making the island more habitable

24:48.966 --> 24:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by planting trees.

24:51.066 --> 24:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this local official
doesn't want the Rohingyas
moving into his district.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thinks it will create more
problems for his community.

24:58.766 --> 25:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MINAZUR RAHMAN, Local
Official (through
translator): In the past,
the Rohingya were related to

25:01.633 --> 25:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the drug problem.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are linked to drugs,
linked to smuggling.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the people here, their
main livelihood is fishing.

25:07.900 --> 25:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bad character and influence
of the Rohingya people will
impact the locals here.

25:11.966 --> 25:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: But the
Bangladeshi government
believe the Rohingyas
cross the border at

25:15.933 --> 25:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will, with the help of smugglers
and corrupt border guards.

25:19.700 --> 25:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government argues the
relocation will guarantee their
isolation from the rest of

25:23.800 --> 25:25.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the population.

25:25.766 --> 25:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the island is formed by
river sediment, making it
unstable, and it could be eroded

in five years' time.

Dr. Ainun Nishat is a
leading expert on climate
change in Bangladesh.

AINUN NISHAT, Climate Change
Expert: The main history of
the coastal belt of Bangladesh

25:38.966 --> 25:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is highly vulnerable to storm
surges and cyclonic weather.

25:45.733 --> 25:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Due to impact of climate change,
we believe that the frequency
of climate change may not

25:51.933 --> 25:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be increasing, but intensity
of the storm surges are
definitely going to increase.

25:56.700 --> 26:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they should be accommodated
in good concrete structure,
where at the time of emergency

26:05.166 --> 26:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people should we -- can
be moved to a height
of 20 feet and above.

TANIA RASHID: Today, about
one million Rohingyas
live in apartheid-like
conditions in internment

26:16.366 --> 26:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camps in Rakhine State of
Myanmar, separated from
the Buddhist majority.

26:21.766 --> 26:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have no citizenship, and
need permission to marry or
to travel outside of their own

26:25.433 --> 26:27.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
villages.

26:27.433 --> 26:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On October 9 of last year,
Rohingya militants killed
nine Myanmar police officers.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Myanmar military
then led a wide and
brutal counterinsurgency
campaign in retaliation,

26:38.866 --> 26:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they killed more
than 1,000 Rohingyas,
torched homes and mosques.

26:42.733 --> 26:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Myanmar government calls
these accusations exaggerations
and denies charges of ethnic

26:47.700 --> 26:49.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cleansing.

26:49.366 --> 26:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Dil Nawaz is one of
70,000 Rohingya's who
fled to Bangladesh.

26:53.400 --> 26:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was gang-raped by soldiers,
and witnessed her husband's
murder in front of her eyes.

26:58.133 --> 27:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm looking at a photo of
her husband who was hacked to
death about five months ago,

27:04.666 --> 27:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and this is a photograph
she took shortly after
she was murdered.

27:06.666 --> 27:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIL NAWAZ, Refugee (through
translator): They used a machete
on my husband in front of me

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the road.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I saw it with my own eyes.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They chopped him into pieces
in front of me in a rice field.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, the army came and took
all the women out to the rice
fields and took several women.

27:23.866 --> 27:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Five men took turns raping them.

27:26.066 --> 27:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They took people's gold
jewelry, rings and earrings.

27:30.533 --> 27:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They killed some children.

27:32.366 --> 27:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they burned all the houses
down, followed by the mosque.

27:36.233 --> 27:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then the military went
back to a Buddhist area.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is why we
fled to Bangladesh.

27:41.433 --> 27:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: Activist
Hafez says they have
found refuge here.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ (through translator):
Bangladesh is small, and
overpopulated, but they gave us

27:49.900 --> 27:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a place to stand.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a big thing.

27:53.466 --> 27:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: But like many
other Rohingya, he wants
a sense of permanence.

27:57.133 --> 28:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ (through translator):
Instead of sending us to Thenga
Chor, if the Myanmar government

28:01.733 --> 28:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could, we request that
they grant us citizenship.

28:05.066 --> 28:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: Forty-five-year
old Dilbar hopes for a
last-ditch political solution.

28:09.633 --> 28:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DILBAR, Refugee (through
translator): If the
Bangladesh government and
the Myanmar government

28:14.166 --> 28:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiate a deal and send us
back, then we will be happy.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If this doesn't happen,
then please bomb us.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We came here, left
our homes, rice.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We came here to save our lives.

28:26.033 --> 28:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we have no peace,
then it's better to die.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our children died there.

28:30.966 --> 28:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We sacrificed everything
and came here for peace.

28:34.466 --> 28:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you take us to the
island, it will be like
killing us, slaughtering us.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are like Anthony Scaramucci.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are nothing.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It won't take much to kill us.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just bomb us.

28:46.366 --> 28:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody will make a case
against you, because we have
no ground under our feet.

28:50.233 --> 28:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: Their hope, to
find that safe ground one day.

28:53.733 --> 28:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for now, they remain
in limbo, not of this land
and not pushed from it.

29:00.800 --> 29:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tania Rashid on Thenga
Chor Island, Bangladesh.

29:15.033 --> 29:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our series
of conversations focusing on the
road ahead for the Democratic

29:24.700 --> 29:26.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

29:26.733 --> 29:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Senate and House
Democratic leaders
left Washington for a
stop in Berryville in

29:30.600 --> 29:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Northwest Virginia, estimated
population around 4,300.

29:35.433 --> 29:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was to roll out a new,
more populist message
focusing on economic issues.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said it's what the party
needs to win back voters.

29:43.133 --> 29:45.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:45.066 --> 29:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: When you lose elections,
as we did in 2014 and

29:47.600 --> 29:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2016, you don't flinch.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You don't blink.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You look in the mirror and
ask, what did we do wrong?

29:55.800 --> 30:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number one thing we did
wrong is not present a strong,
bold economic agenda to working

30:04.200 --> 30:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Americans, so that their
hope for the future
might return again.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:10.066 --> 30:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: That is why,
today, Democrats are unveiling

30:12.100 --> 30:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aggressive and ambitious
economic agenda, and a bold new
promise to America's working

30:18.666 --> 30:20.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

30:20.633 --> 30:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the heartland -- these
members are from the heartland,
but to the suburbs, to the

30:24.833 --> 30:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cities, Democrats are offering
a better deal, better jobs,
better wages, a better future.

30:32.066 --> 30:34.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN RAY LUJAN (D), New
Mexico: Voters, constituents
want us to focus on them.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want us to
understand where they are.

30:38.866 --> 30:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they want us to understand
that their wages are not
keeping up with their cost of

30:42.466 --> 30:44.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
living.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the more people that are
able to have that conversation
with the American people,

30:46.400 --> 30:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we will be in a
stronger place in 2018.

30:49.100 --> 30:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joining me now
to discuss the new agenda, and
the way forward for the party,

30:55.766 --> 30:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is the chairman of the
Democratic National
Committee, Tom Perez.

30:57.866 --> 31:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how did the Democratic Party
get to the point where you have
to be reintroducing yourselves

31:05.333 --> 31:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the American people, telling
them what you stand for?

31:07.400 --> 31:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ, Chairman,
Democratic National
Committee: Well, we have
heard across America

31:08.866 --> 31:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from people that they don't
know what we stand for.

31:12.166 --> 31:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have been traveling
to countries listening.

31:14.633 --> 31:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what Leader Pelosi,
Senator Schumer and others
today have been doing is telling

31:19.233 --> 31:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people not only what
we're fighting for, but
who we're fighting for.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're fighting for a
better future for everyone.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're fighting to address
the most important
issue of our time, which
is income inequality.

31:29.066 --> 31:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're fighting and showing
people that we believe that
everyone has an opportunity,

31:33.800 --> 31:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or should have an opportunity,
to punch their ticket to the
middle class, that health care

31:37.166 --> 31:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a right for all, not
a privilege for a few.

31:39.900 --> 31:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, again, we're not
only talking about what
we're fighting for,
but who we're fighting

31:44.033 --> 31:45.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

31:45.266 --> 31:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're fighting for
the many, not the few.

31:46.733 --> 31:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're fighting for an economy
that works for everyone.

31:48.766 --> 31:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this
different, Tom Perez, from the
Democrats' message before now?

31:52.900 --> 31:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I think
-- I worked for Ted Kennedy.

31:54.900 --> 31:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Ted Kennedy always fought
for he called the common
man and the common woman.

31:58.700 --> 32:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the Democratic
Party, we have always been
fighting for ordinary Americans,

32:03.400 --> 32:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it was fighting for
the Social Security Act in the
1930s, fighting for Medicare and

32:09.933 --> 32:12.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

32:12.033 --> 32:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be celebrating
the anniversary of Medicaid
and Medicare in a few days.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fighting for the
Affordable Care Act.

32:15.733 --> 32:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fighting for good jobs.

32:17.700 --> 32:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we need to do is
underscore what we have been
doing and tell people how we're

32:21.633 --> 32:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to continue that fight,
because Donald Trump attempted
to hijack that message.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to tell people
exactly who's fighting for them.

32:30.133 --> 32:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is part
of the reason you need to do
this that the party has been

32:32.800 --> 32:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending -- and Democrats
-- have been spending so
much time talking about
Donald Trump, criticizing

32:37.633 --> 32:39.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

32:39.666 --> 32:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just today, I got another press
release from the Democratic
National Committee about Jared

32:42.800 --> 32:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kushner's meeting with Senate
investigators on Russia.

32:46.500 --> 32:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you have been -- by you, I
mean Democrats - - been spending
too much time criticizing

32:50.666 --> 32:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, in other words,
talking about what you're
against, rather than what you're

32:54.800 --> 32:56.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, when we
have a vote on the Affordable
Care Act repeal tomorrow, it's

32:58.966 --> 33:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important for us to talk about
the fact that that's not a
health care bill, it's a massive

33:04.966 --> 33:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tax cut for wealthy people.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But your point is absolutely
well taken, which is we can't
simply be against Donald Trump.

33:11.600 --> 33:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to be for the values
that Senator Schumer, Leader
Pelosi and all of us have

33:16.466 --> 33:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been talking about.

33:17.733 --> 33:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what I do
day in and day out.

33:19.766 --> 33:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats believe that no
one who works a full-time job
should have to live in poverty.

33:23.900 --> 33:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats believe that, again,
health care is a right for
all and not a privilege for

33:27.700 --> 33:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few, that the secretary
of education ought to
believe in public education.

33:32.466 --> 33:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I was labor secretary,
I was fighting for higher
wages, overtime pay for people.

33:37.233 --> 33:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was fighting for retirement
security for folks.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We were fighting to make
sure that people had
the skills to compete.

33:43.266 --> 33:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Republicans were
always fighting against that.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't want to raise
the overtime threshold.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fought our efforts at
making sure that anyone who had
a 401(k) or an IRA could get

33:54.466 --> 33:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the advice they need.

33:56.466 --> 34:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we have to do a better
job of as Democrats is tell
folks exactly what we have

34:02.400 --> 34:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been fighting for and what they
have been fighting against.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does this
fit into the debate that I
have been hearing out there?

34:07.400 --> 34:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, you hear
I guess you would call them
centrist Democrats saying, well,

34:11.233 --> 34:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the party didn't pay enough
attention to the Middle America,
working-class Americans, it

34:17.700 --> 34:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spent too much time on what
they call identity politics.

34:19.700 --> 34:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, on the other hand, you
have got the more progressive
wing of the party saying,

34:22.900 --> 34:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, no, the party forgot about
its base, it about minorities,
about black voters, about

34:28.500 --> 34:29.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hispanic voters.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you're hearing two
different critiques.

34:32.733 --> 34:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does what you're saying
the party is arguing now, how
does it fit into that argument?

34:39.766 --> 34:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I think it's
a false choice to suggest that
you either do one or the other.

34:42.100 --> 34:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And as Dr. King said, the best
civil right is a good job.

34:46.733 --> 34:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What good is a seat at
the counter if you can't
afford to buy a hamburger?

34:50.633 --> 34:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And economic opportunity
for everyone is what we
have been talking about.

34:55.100 --> 34:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we have to do a
better job of as Democrats is
talk about that in every zip

34:59.600 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
code.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A big part of what we're doing
with the Democratic Party is
we're building a 12-month-a-year

35:06.766 --> 35:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organizing presence
in every zip code.

35:08.866 --> 35:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to talk to folks in
rural America, urban America,
suburban America, because the

35:14.500 --> 35:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opioid epidemic is touching
all of those communities.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to tell them that
we are the party that's trying
to make sure that we retain

35:20.600 --> 35:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
access to health care.

35:22.666 --> 35:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the party that's making
sure that you have the skills
to compete, not only for today's

35:27.100 --> 35:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, but for the dynamic
economy and the jobs that
will be coming tomorrow.

35:31.400 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what Democrats have
been fighting for, and I think
that message resonates in every

35:35.333 --> 35:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zip code across the country.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everyone wants good
public education.

35:38.733 --> 35:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Doesn't matter where you live.

35:39.933 --> 35:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what
we're fighting for.

35:41.966 --> 35:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former President
Obama himself said that he was
partly to blame for the fact

35:44.233 --> 35:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the party didn't so as much
as it should have done, could
have been doing at the state

35:48.533 --> 35:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level, at the local level.

35:51.033 --> 35:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the party now going
to be working actively to
recruit and be more present
in local communities,

35:58.333 --> 35:59.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in cities?

35:59.333 --> 36:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Absolutely.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have changed our
mission statement.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our mission is no longer
simply to elect the president
of the United States.

36:06.066 --> 36:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our mission is to elect
Democrats up and down the
ticket, from the school
board to the Senate.

36:10.366 --> 36:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And our mission is to be
there in every zip code.

36:12.333 --> 36:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we helped two
candidates who were running in
Oklahoma a couple weeks ago who

36:15.900 --> 36:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
won special elections
in districts that
Donald Trump had won.

36:19.766 --> 36:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a
57-state-and-territory strategy.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to
organize everywhere.

36:25.533 --> 36:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we to have to be a
12-month-a-year party.

36:27.200 --> 36:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't just show up
every fourth October and
call that organizing.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to organize everywhere.

36:34.133 --> 36:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's everywhere
every year.

36:36.166 --> 36:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to
come back to the question we
were discussing a minute ago.

36:39.933 --> 36:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is, how much of
what people are hearing
from Democrats now
is anti-Donald Trump?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you both do this,
the positive things
you're talking about, and
remain this relentless

36:52.033 --> 36:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-Trump machine that many
people think the Democrats are?

36:55.633 --> 37:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well,
we can't match Trump
tweet for tweet, because
distracting Donald frequently

37:00.433 --> 37:02.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

37:02.433 --> 37:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure, at the G20,
everyone was talking about
John Podesta's tweets.

37:08.433 --> 37:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when you -- and then
you have this misnamed voter
integrity commission, which

37:11.300 --> 37:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a voter suppression
commission.

37:13.933 --> 37:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can't allow all of
the relentless conflict
and chaos that emanates
from this administration

37:23.233 --> 37:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take our eye off the ball.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's what today was
about with Leader Pelosi
and Senator Schumer.

37:28.433 --> 37:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was about telling the
American people we are the party
that's fighting for a better

37:32.600 --> 37:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future for folks, for everyone.

37:34.700 --> 37:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the party that's going
to make sure that you get that
good job that pays a decent

37:39.133 --> 37:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wage that allows
you to have dignity.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we have to do that.

37:44.233 --> 37:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's exactly what I do
everywhere I go, Judy, because
it is so important to tell

37:47.933 --> 37:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people what we stand for
and who we stand with.

37:51.533 --> 37:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Perez, the
chairman of the Democratic
Party, thank you very much.

37:57.633 --> 38:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Pleasure
to be with you.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As I was
starting to say, one
clear challenge facing
Democrats and Republicans,

38:17.900 --> 38:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staying on message, when
the president can so quickly
stir up a new controversy.

38:21.833 --> 38:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, will a shakeup in the
White House communications
team change all that?

38:25.866 --> 38:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Politics Monday duo is here
to weigh in, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, Tamara

38:30.633 --> 38:32.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keith of NPR.

38:32.566 --> 38:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But because you both were
sitting here as I was just
talking to Tom Perez, Tam, let's

38:37.500 --> 38:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start by talking about that.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of the
Democrats' effort now?

38:40.733 --> 38:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hear him saying, we're
trying to get back to business
here, to go to appeal to voters

38:45.066 --> 38:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where they are.

38:46.266 --> 38:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Yes.

38:48.266 --> 38:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a struggle when I
covered the Clinton campaign
that they had, which he was sort

38:51.566 --> 38:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of getting at a little bit,
which is the thing where they
would want to talk about issues,

38:56.233 --> 38:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would want to talk about
policy, they would want to
have an affirmative message,

38:59.366 --> 39:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then Donald Trump
would do something and
they would just slip back
into being the opposition

39:05.833 --> 39:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the other person who
is running for president.

39:08.300 --> 39:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Democrats, I think,
struggle with that now in, you
know, are they the resistance

39:14.166 --> 39:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or are they for something?

39:16.533 --> 39:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And today was an effort to sort
of begin talking about what
they are for, at the same time

39:22.966 --> 39:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're also talking about
what they're against still.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
they're against.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amy, can they do this?

39:27.133 --> 39:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes, I
think that's very doable.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The biggest challenge
for Democrats -- I think
we discussed this the
last time -- is that

39:33.100 --> 39:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're the out party, so
they don't set the agenda.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Republicans set the agenda.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to respond to
an agenda that's being set
by the Republican Party.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other question is not just
so much about the message.

39:43.266 --> 39:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can put together a
big messaging strategy,
but the messenger matters.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in 2016, it was pretty
clear that the messenger that
Democrats had wasn't seen as

39:50.733 --> 39:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believable on a lot
of these issues.

39:52.133 --> 39:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton.

39:54.133 --> 39:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The Hillary Clinton
campaign had - - how many
reams of policy papers did you

39:57.233 --> 39:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go through, Tam, about
all of these issues?

39:58.733 --> 40:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think there were
like 10,000 pages of policy...

40:00.333 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:02.433 --> 40:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's not that she
didn't and the campaign didn't
have a plan on the economy.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:05.333 --> 40:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: I think it
was a million words.

40:07.033 --> 40:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But not like they didn't
have a plan for the economy.

40:09.533 --> 40:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that the messenger wasn't
seen as an effective messenger
or believable messenger.

40:14.133 --> 40:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the challenge, I think,
for Democrats right now going
into the midterm election

40:17.300 --> 40:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is finding candidates who
fit the districts, who have a
message that fits their specific

40:23.800 --> 40:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
area, and that they're
believable, that
they're authentic.

40:26.733 --> 40:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say
they are -- they are saying
they recruiting more people to

40:31.466 --> 40:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run, at least at the
congressional level.

40:33.366 --> 40:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And they are.

40:34.366 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At the congressional level.

40:37.433 --> 40:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you just
heard Tom Perez talking about
the state and local races, too.

40:39.066 --> 40:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: It's always
the challenge and
the good and the bad.

40:42.033 --> 40:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have tons of candidates
now on the Democratic
side either running or
talking about running.

40:49.066 --> 40:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means big primaries and
that means you don't know who's
going to come out of a primary,

40:54.600 --> 40:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially the candidate
who doesn't fit as the right
messenger for that district.

40:57.133 --> 40:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning?

40:59.200 --> 41:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Meaning that you
get somebody in a district
that fits that district really

41:05.266 --> 41:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, but loses in a 10- or
eight-way primary to a different
kind of Democratic candidate.

41:10.766 --> 41:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is not much that
the party can do about that.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they're
going to try, aren't they, Tam?

41:16.933 --> 41:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, right now, Tom Perez
cited this poll that shows most
people think all the Democrats

41:23.566 --> 41:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stand for or mostly what
they stand for is being
against Donald Trump.

41:25.533 --> 41:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And they have
been pretty loudly against
Donald Trump, but you know what?

41:29.900 --> 41:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a long way out from
that midterm election.

41:33.766 --> 41:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's a lot of time
to actually hear a message.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't even know who the
candidates are at this point,
and the candidates do matter,

41:41.266 --> 41:43.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as Amy says.

41:43.833 --> 41:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
speaking of Donald Trump,
Amy Walter, he chose
a new communications

41:49.233 --> 41:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
director late last
week, as press secretary
and communications
director Sean Spicer has

41:53.533 --> 41:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now left the White House.

41:55.533 --> 41:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anthony Scaramucci out on
all the weekend talk shows,
saying he loves this president,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that they're going to have
a new approach, and they're
going to be positive and they're

42:05.500 --> 42:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to do well.

42:07.466 --> 42:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The new approach
is a lot like the old approach,
which is, let Donald Trump

42:08.900 --> 42:10.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be Donald Trump.

42:10.066 --> 42:11.466 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You're not going
to manage Trump.

42:11.466 --> 42:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not going to micromanage
his Twitter account.

42:14.600 --> 42:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What works best is when Donald
Trump works in the mode that
he likes to operate in, as

42:20.466 --> 42:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he did in the 2016 campaign.

42:22.833 --> 42:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge, of course, with
any communications shakeup at
the White House is that we know

42:27.633 --> 42:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is one communications
director at the White House,
and his name is Donald

42:31.433 --> 42:32.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
J. Trump.

42:32.966 --> 42:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't matter who else gets
a title over at the White House.

42:35.866 --> 42:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you think what's been
working right now at the
White House has been effective

42:42.766 --> 42:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or what they're doing at the
White House has been effective,
then you're going to keep

42:44.600 --> 42:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - you're going
to say that's OK.

42:47.266 --> 42:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the fact is, their
legislative agenda is stalled.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That hasn't been working.

42:52.466 --> 42:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Letting Donald Trump be
Donald Trump hasn't helped
with his approval ratings.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're stuck now
somewhere at 40 percent.

42:57.166 --> 43:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we just discussed, it's
not helping in terms of
the 2018 midterm elections.

43:01.533 --> 43:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats are energized,
Republicans not as energized.

43:08.566 --> 43:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strategy is basically to
keep doing things the way that
we have been doing them, but,

43:10.166 --> 43:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now, six months
in, it hasn't been
particularly effective.

43:13.233 --> 43:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does this
look to somebody who covers the
White House all the time, Tam?

43:17.200 --> 43:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It looks like
there's a new person who, as
you said, he talks about loving

43:24.133 --> 43:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, about, you know
-- he definitely will be someone
who is a salesman for the

43:30.100 --> 43:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president's message.

43:32.133 --> 43:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at the Sunday
show appearances, you had Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, who is the

43:37.266 --> 43:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
new press secretary,
saying one thing.

43:39.066 --> 43:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You had Scaramucci
saying another thing.

43:43.333 --> 43:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you had the president
of the United States tweeting
something somewhere in between.

43:49.733 --> 43:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're still
trying to figure this out.

43:51.833 --> 43:56.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the things going
on in the tweeting,
Amy, is the president
continuing to criticize

43:58.533 --> 44:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or to say to Republicans,
you have got to come on
board with health care.

44:00.666 --> 44:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been tweeting about
it just a few minutes ago.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: He's been
tweeting about it.

44:04.833 --> 44:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, he stood
in the White House today and
basically put an ultimatum

44:07.666 --> 44:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in front of his party
that said, you are either
with me or you're not.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the marker has
been put right there.

44:15.966 --> 44:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so the choice for
Republicans tomorrow
is, are they going to
defy their president,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after saying -- after
he told them this will
be in defiance of me?

44:23.833 --> 44:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He said there
are going to be consequences
if we don't -- if you don't

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support this.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Meanwhile, he
was talking about members of
his own party as they, as if it

44:31.433 --> 44:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was not -- as if they weren't
part of the same team.

44:34.400 --> 44:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was highly critical of
senators, saying, if you don't
do this, then you're breaking

44:38.833 --> 44:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a promise and there
are consequences.

44:41.400 --> 44:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he made a tiny little
aside sort of indicating
that he wanted voters
to call their senators

44:48.233 --> 44:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or get in touch or make
it painful for their
senators, which is a turn.

44:53.766 --> 44:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's him, the president,
publicly advocating for
a piece of legislation.

44:55.866 --> 44:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quickly, he's also putting
pressure on his own attorney

44:59.433 --> 45:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
general, Amy, in just
a few seconds, saying
our beleaguered A.G.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you're Jeff Sessions, what
are you thinking right now?

45:06.766 --> 45:07.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:07.766 --> 45:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As with many people in the Trump
administration, if you work
for him, you have to know that

45:11.433 --> 45:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your job is always precarious.

45:13.866 --> 45:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no ultimate
loyalty if you work there.

45:17.633 --> 45:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's never clear whether
you're safe or not safe with
this president in your job at

45:23.233 --> 45:25.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Sessions
was at lunch at the
White House today and
didn't see the president.

45:27.733 --> 45:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hmm.

45:29.200 --> 45:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we will leave it
at that, Politics Monday.

45:32.333 --> 45:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tamara Keith, Amy
Walter, thank you both.

45:36.433 --> 45:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

45:44.433 --> 45:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle to
dislodge ISIS from its makeshift
capital, Raqqa, in Syria

45:53.066 --> 45:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is intensifying, as U.S.-backed
militia press the offensive.

45:57.233 --> 46:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for years, a group of
citizen journalists have
documented life inside the city.

46:04.200 --> 46:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their work started when the
uprising began in 2011 against
Syria's president, Bashar

46:08.333 --> 46:10.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Assad.

46:10.366 --> 46:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it continues today
under even more deadly and
dangerous circumstances.

46:13.300 --> 46:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has their story.

46:15.333 --> 46:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They call
themselves Raqqa is Being
Slaughtered Silently.

46:18.933 --> 46:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last year, the Committee to
Protect Journalists awarded the
group its International Press

46:23.433 --> 46:25.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Freedom Award.

46:25.033 --> 46:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Their story is now
told in a documentary
titled "City of Ghosts."

46:28.633 --> 46:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And joining me is the film's
director, Matthew Heineman,
and Abdul-Aziz al-Hamza, one of

46:34.366 --> 46:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the group's members.

46:35.366 --> 46:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

46:37.300 --> 46:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA,
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered
Silently: Thank you.

46:39.366 --> 46:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Aziz, I want
to -- you and your friends and
colleagues are not fighters.

46:40.833 --> 46:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were not journalists
before all of this started.

46:44.033 --> 46:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In your own words, what are you?

46:46.500 --> 46:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you describe yourselves?

46:48.600 --> 46:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: Before the
Syrian revolution, before all
what happened in Syria, I was a

46:51.966 --> 46:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
normal teenager who was
studying biochemistry.

46:55.266 --> 46:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I had nothing to
do with politics.

46:57.700 --> 47:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Even my family had like
no political background.

47:01.133 --> 47:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I was as any college
student anywhere.

47:05.200 --> 47:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, when
this started, you and your
friends felt you had to document

47:10.933 --> 47:13.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: The way
how the Syrian regime and ISIS
prevented the international

47:15.466 --> 47:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media organizations to come and
cover what's going on, it was
like kind of a duty to cover

47:21.533 --> 47:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the atrocities of both of them.

47:24.233 --> 47:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we decided first with
our mobile phones to
film the demonstrations.

47:27.800 --> 47:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At our own, we developed
our skills to document
what the human rights
violations against the

47:34.700 --> 47:36.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Matthew,
many stories are told about
Syria, why was this the one you

47:39.933 --> 47:42.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wanted to tell?

47:42.033 --> 47:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN, Director,
"City of Ghosts": You know, I
was really fascinated by this

47:44.000 --> 47:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war of ideas, this war of
propaganda, this information
war between ISIS on one hand and

47:48.933 --> 47:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RBSS on the other.

47:51.133 --> 47:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ISIS uses these slick,
almost Hollywood-style
videos to disseminate
fear across the world

47:57.566 --> 48:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to attract followers
and proclaim a safe haven,
a paradise for Muslims.

48:05.033 --> 48:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RBSS and the work of
Aziz and his colleagues
totally counter that and
show the extraordinarily

48:12.700 --> 48:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awful human rights violations
that they're committing
almost on a daily basis.

48:16.633 --> 48:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, that's what
initially drew me to the film,
but the film became much more

48:19.866 --> 48:21.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that to me.

48:21.866 --> 48:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became a -- ultimately, it
became a story of them fleeing,
being forced to flee from

48:25.300 --> 48:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria, to Turkey,
and Turkey to Europe.

48:27.566 --> 48:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It became an immigrant story.

48:29.400 --> 48:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It became a story of rising
nationalism in Europe.

48:32.366 --> 48:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became a story about trauma
and the cumulative effects of
trauma, so it became much more

48:37.100 --> 48:39.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, let's
take a look at a clip that
shows a little bit of the work

48:40.300 --> 48:41.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of your group.

48:41.566 --> 48:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: We are made up
to have two groups.

48:43.866 --> 48:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The internal group is in
Raqqa and is made up of
around 17 correspondents.

48:59.933 --> 49:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The internal group's mission
is to film, photograph
and deliver urgent news.

49:06.200 --> 49:11.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The

49:21.633 --> 49:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary mission of the external
term group is to communicate
with the group inside.

49:25.233 --> 49:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Rashidi, go to the door.

49:28.733 --> 49:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A girl is going to
bring you stuff.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is wearing a
deep red head scarf.

49:33.466 --> 49:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The internal group then
sends us the information.

49:36.766 --> 49:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
There's a big airstrike
in the north from our
correspondent Iyan Issa

49:43.866 --> 49:45.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(ph).

49:45.333 --> 49:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We, the external group,
then distribute it to the world.

49:48.433 --> 49:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Aziz, the
film mostly, necessarily,
spends its time with you and

49:55.233 --> 49:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your colleagues who
are outside Raqqa.

49:57.433 --> 50:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those who are inside,
who we just saw, how are
they able to do their work?

50:02.133 --> 50:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what kind of
dangers do they face?

50:04.233 --> 50:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: So, they
are like -- in every second
and every moment they are like

50:07.800 --> 50:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a dangerous and
a risky situation.

50:10.133 --> 50:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they could be
killed by ISIS, the
airstrikes, the shelling.

50:17.233 --> 50:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are risking their
lives daily to show the
reality of what's going on.

50:20.966 --> 50:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Matthew, you and
I talked about your last film,
which was really around the

50:24.733 --> 50:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border area in the U.S., and
the way you told that story,
sort of embedding yourself into

50:32.233 --> 50:33.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the violence.

50:33.233 --> 50:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a little different.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell me how you made this film.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Yes,
so this was a different
experience for me.

50:39.633 --> 50:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was forced to -- I
wasn't able to go to Raqqa.

50:42.266 --> 50:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would be killed instantly.

50:44.300 --> 50:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I started filming them
in Turkey after they were forced
to flee, after some of the

50:49.833 --> 50:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members of their
group were killed.

50:51.933 --> 50:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the sort of through-line
of the film is basically me
with them as they are escaping

50:58.100 --> 51:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from safe house to safe house,
ultimately landing in Europe.

51:01.266 --> 51:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think these issues
of ISIS and Syria are so
often relegated to headlines

51:08.933 --> 51:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to stats, and I
really wanted to put a
human face to this topic.

51:12.966 --> 51:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What
is the situation now?

51:15.266 --> 51:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the battle for Raqqa
is going on, and we read about
airstrikes, civilians being

51:21.200 --> 51:22.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurt.

51:22.466 --> 51:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the situation
for your colleagues?

51:24.533 --> 51:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: For the
people of Raqqa, so they are
suffering not only by ISIS, by

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the airstrike of the
international coalition.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the
Russians are still bombing
the city, the Syrian regime.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, everyone is like
bombing the city.

51:35.766 --> 51:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The local are besieged
between all these sides.

51:38.600 --> 51:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The condition is the city,
the services are like so bad.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everything is getting
expensive day after day.

51:44.766 --> 51:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People are missing
like many things for
their necessary lives.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many people were kind of
trying to flee the city, but
the land mines -- so it's a

51:54.833 --> 51:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
horrible situation.

51:56.866 --> 52:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With the outcome
in Raqqa still so uncertain,
do you know whether you will

52:02.800 --> 52:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to return or to
what kind of city you
will be able to return to?

52:04.833 --> 52:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: I hope
that one day, I will be able
to return to Raqqa, to my city.

52:09.666 --> 52:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So that's the reason
why I started this group
with my colleagues, so
to fight for our city,

52:16.566 --> 52:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able one day to go
back and lead the rest of
our lives in Raqqa and Syria.

52:22.266 --> 52:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I don't want to be
like a fugitive anymore.

52:24.666 --> 52:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Matthew,
what do you hope people take
from this, from your film?

52:28.033 --> 52:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Bombs
are not going to fix ISIS.

52:31.233 --> 52:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This ground war that
we're fighting is not
going to end ISIS.

52:34.933 --> 52:36.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS is an idea.

52:36.933 --> 52:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to fight
this idea with the same
tools that they're using.

52:41.300 --> 52:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think, you know, we,
as a global community, we,
as the United States, we as

52:48.233 --> 52:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalists, have to figure out
ways to combat ISIS' ideology,
ISIS' extremist ideology,

52:54.333 --> 52:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just with guns and bombs,
but with words, with campaigns
like the amazing work that

53:01.533 --> 53:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this group is doing.

53:03.066 --> 53:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new film is "City of Ghosts."

53:05.366 --> 53:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matthew Heineman and
Abdul-Aziz al-Hamza,
thank you both very much.

53:13.833 --> 53:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Thank you.

53:20.933 --> 53:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a
news update before we go.

53:27.933 --> 53:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Israeli government says that
it will remove metal detectors
from a holy site in Jerusalem

53:32.566 --> 53:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have caused
anger among Muslims.

53:34.366 --> 53:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of a
compromise to defuse the
security crisis there.

53:39.200 --> 53:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: One
health care frustration many
Americans share is the lack

53:46.033 --> 53:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of transparency when it
comes to the costs of
medical tests and treatments.

53:50.700 --> 53:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One woman shares her odyssey of
trying to track down answers.

53:53.266 --> 53:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plus, we get two reactions
from health care experts.

53:56.533 --> 54:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:04.633 --> 54:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Join us online and again
here tomorrow evening.

54:06.733 --> 54:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
