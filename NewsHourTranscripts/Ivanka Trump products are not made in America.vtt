JUDY WOODRUFF: At the
White House, it is Made
in America Week, an effort
to highlight President

00:05.133 --> 00:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's goal of boosting U.S.
manufacturing and job creation.

00:09.133 --> 00:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, it has again
sparked questions over
Mr. Trump and his family's
businesses, particularly

00:15.300 --> 00:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where their products
are manufactured.

00:18.033 --> 00:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

00:20.033 --> 00:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, the White
House South Lawn was turned into
a showcase for products made

00:25.133 --> 00:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in each of the 50 states.

00:27.133 --> 00:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But not on display, merchandise
sold by the Trump Organization
or Ivanka Trump's fashion

00:32.000 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most of those things
are made overseas.

00:35.733 --> 00:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here to talk about how
Ivanka Trump's clothing
is made is Matea Gold
of The Washington Post.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's part of a team of
reporters that investigated
the Ivanka Trump brand's
manufacturing practices.

00:46.866 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matea, thanks for joining us.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In your story, you said that
the Ivanka Trump fashion line
had retail sales of about $100

00:54.433 --> 00:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
million last year.

00:56.666 --> 00:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does she make, and
where does she make them?

00:58.766 --> 01:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington
Post: The Ivanka Trump brand,
which the first daughter still

01:02.333 --> 01:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owns, but doesn't control
on a day-to-day management,
makes clothes, handmade shoes

01:09.100 --> 01:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an array of overseas
factories, we found exclusively,
in foreign factories.

01:15.833 --> 01:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traced her current line
of products to five specific
countries, Bangladesh, China,

01:20.766 --> 01:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

01:24.200 --> 01:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also customs records
that show that, back in 2013,
some of her shoes were made

01:28.900 --> 01:30.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Ethiopia.

01:30.933 --> 01:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the brand told us that,
while they would like to bring
manufacturing back to the United

01:35.233 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States, they don't feel like
it's really possible to do
in a large-scale fashion.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And how
does this compare?

01:41.300 --> 01:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should also note that
the Trump brand, the Trump
Organization brand products made

01:45.900 --> 01:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in about 12 different countries,
including Bangladesh and China.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this compare with
the rest of the industry?

01:52.233 --> 01:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, the reality
is that the American apparel
industry is very firmly grounded

01:58.400 --> 02:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in globalization and
overseas production.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 97 percent of the clothes
and shoes sold here in the
United States are made abroad.

02:07.966 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And industry experts say that
it is going to be incredibly
difficult to reverse that

02:11.433 --> 02:14.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trend.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the focus in the
industry right now is not
on bringing manufacturing
back in a large-scale

02:19.333 --> 02:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fashion, but rather trying
to give consumers a sense of
confidence that their goods are

02:24.533 --> 02:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not being made by workers
overseas who are being
exploited for their labor.

02:26.900 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And how does
the Ivanka Trump fashion
line measure up to the
rest of the industry

02:31.100 --> 02:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that sort of thing in
policing labor conditions
at the factories they use?

02:38.166 --> 02:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: We found that the
Ivanka Trump brand lags behind
many in the apparel industry,

02:44.333 --> 02:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both large and small
companies, when it comes
to having oversight of
their foreign production.

02:49.133 --> 02:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up to now, they have really
relied on their suppliers to
certify that they are complying

02:55.166 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their code of conduct, a
code of conduct, I should note,
that they would not publicly

02:57.400 --> 02:59.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disclose.

02:59.566 --> 03:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are taking measures now
to do greater oversight, the
kind of measures that other

03:05.533 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
companies already have,
such as bringing in a
group to independently
audit factories and

03:11.433 --> 03:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to provide some programs on the
ground to support some of the
women who make their clothes.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what did the
Trump people say to you?

03:19.366 --> 03:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Sean Spicer was asked
today about some of this in the
White House briefing, and said

03:22.766 --> 03:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be inappropriate for
him to talk about a private
business at the White House

03:27.400 --> 03:28.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
podium.

03:28.933 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did they tell you in
response to these things?

03:30.933 --> 03:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, the president
of the Ivanka Trump brand,
Abigail Klem, told us that one

03:35.033 --> 03:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the reasons they had not
taken these other measures that
other companies have is because

03:39.066 --> 03:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're a newer and smaller
brand and that they're looking
now to really try to live

03:46.000 --> 03:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their mission of women who
work, which is the motto Ivanka
Trump developed at her company

03:50.400 --> 03:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
throughout their
whole supply chain.

03:52.433 --> 03:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something that they
said is evolving and they're
going to continue to strive to

03:56.233 --> 03:58.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Klem also told us that the
goal of bringing manufacturing
back to the United States for

04:01.233 --> 04:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their company was just
unrealistic, that there
aren't trained workers
that work in the apparel

04:06.200 --> 04:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry here anymore, and,
in many cases, the machinery
doesn't even exist to do this

04:10.300 --> 04:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of production.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matea, let me ask you
about something else you have
been reporting on for The Post.

04:16.133 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The financial -- the campaign
spending records of the Trump
2020 campaign shows that they

04:23.000 --> 04:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid money to -- they paid
fees to Donald Trump Jr.'s
lawyer before this latest story

04:28.900 --> 04:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broke about the meeting with the
Russian lawyer, and also they
reimbursed the Trump corporation

04:34.866 --> 04:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for legal consulting fees.

04:36.766 --> 04:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's all this about?

04:38.866 --> 04:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: So, we don't have a
lot of answers from the campaign
committee, which has declined

04:42.133 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to answer questions
about these payments.

04:44.333 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing we saw in the most
recent campaign finance filing
is that the legal fees paid

04:51.233 --> 04:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the campaign committee
skyrocketed in the last quarter,
including a $50,000 retainer

04:56.600 --> 05:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid to a criminal defense
attorney who is now
representing Donald Trump Jr.

05:00.966 --> 05:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This came in late June, before
President Trump himself said
he knew about this meeting in

05:07.800 --> 05:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which there were several
Russian or Russian-linked
people involved.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it does raise questions
about whether this payment
specifically was connected to

05:15.800 --> 05:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Russian probe.

05:17.833 --> 05:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there was also this
reimbursement to the
Trump corporation for
legal fees, which is

05:21.433 --> 05:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the first time we have
seen Trump's own company
being reimbursed for
those kinds of service.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What does the
Federal Election Commission
say about campaign funds being

05:30.100 --> 05:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
used for legal fees?

05:32.066 --> 05:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The campaign
committees have a lot of leeway
to spend money on legal fees,

05:38.100 --> 05:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as long as the payments are
directly connected to activity
connected to the campaign.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if the expenses wouldn't have
been incurred all but for the
campaign committee, they can

05:48.800 --> 05:50.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay them.

05:50.866 --> 05:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if they were expenses that
aren't related to political
activity, they're beyond the

05:52.700 --> 05:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
purview of the committee.

05:54.700 --> 05:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that these payments
were made through the reelection
committee suggests that they

05:58.333 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are connected to some sort of
legal investigation or legal
work connected to the campaign.

06:03.233 --> 06:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matea Gold on legal
fees being paid for by the
campaign and Ivanka Trump's

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
businesses, thank you very much.

06:09.600 --> 06:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Thank you.
