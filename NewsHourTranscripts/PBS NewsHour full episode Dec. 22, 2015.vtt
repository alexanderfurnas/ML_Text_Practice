JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.941 --> 00:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
private U.S.
company makes history by being
the first to

00:12.980 --> 00:18.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
land a reusable rocket
vertically after launching
into orbit.

00:18.552 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: a
report card for
the U.S. looking back at how the
country has

00:23.757 --> 00:29.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handled some of the year's
biggest events,
from the Iran nuclear deal to
terrorist attacks.

00:29.696 --> 00:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the emerging danger of
synthetic drugs
and who is at risk.

00:35.068 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY, Used Synthetic Marijuana:
I remember,
I woke up in the hospital. My
throat hurt

00:39.940 --> 00:44.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so bad. And I was like, why is
my throat hurting?
And it was because they had to
put a tube

00:44.411 --> 00:47.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down my throat because I
couldn't breathe.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.151 --> 00:55.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.489 --> 01:09.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq, army
units advanced
deep into Ramadi today, in a bid
to recapture

01:09.536 --> 01:15.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the key city from Islamic State
control. It's
the latest push in a slow-moving
offensive.

01:15.375 --> 01:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS captured Ramadi last May,
striking a
blow at the Baghdad government.
The city is

01:21.148 --> 01:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital of Anbar province, the
country's Sunni
heartland. Iraqi officials
reported sporadic

01:27.421 --> 01:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting today in the city
center.

01:30.324 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, Taliban fighters
pressed beleaguered
Afghan forces in a crucial
southern province.

01:37.064 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The government sent
reinforcements and Britain
sent military advisers.

01:42.035 --> 01:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
has the story.

01:46.073 --> 01:52.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Fighting even
around Lashkar
Gah, the capital of Helmand
Province. Reports

01:52.312 --> 01:57.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differ, but there is no doubt
that insurgents
have come close to ousting the
Western-backed

01:57.851 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghan army from the town of
Sangin.

02:00.354 --> 02:04.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERZA KHAN RAHIMI, Helmand
Governor (through
translator): We are assessing
the situation

02:04.758 --> 02:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sending supplies to the
security forces.
If there is any failure, then
the Ministry

02:09.262 --> 02:14.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Defense, the Interior
Ministry, the National
Directorate of Security and
Security Council

02:14.134 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a special agenda to solve
it.

02:16.069 --> 02:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: This is now a
military and political
crisis for Afghanistan and NATO.
Things got

02:21.308 --> 02:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so bad, a key Sangin official
put his career
on the line and took to Facebook
on Sunday,

02:26.646 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing to the Afghan president:
"I know that
bringing up the issue on social
media will

02:31.351 --> 02:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make you very angry. But Helmand
stands on
the brink. Ninety men have been
killed in

02:36.323 --> 02:39.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gereshk and Sangin districts in
the last two
days."

02:39.292 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the strategic road to
the Kajakai
Dam from Sangin is cut, so too
routes to other

02:46.199 --> 02:51.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
key areas across Helmand
Province. Ten British
advisers have flown now to
Helmand to advise

02:52.005 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Afghans, but they're miles
away from the
fighting, U.S. and U.K. special
forces also

02:57.577 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reportedly there, very rather
closer.

03:00.547 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, a
U.S. Army sergeant
accused of deserting in
Afghanistan was arraigned

03:06.453 --> 03:12.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before a military judge. Bowe
Bergdahl faces
charges for walking off his post
in 2009.

03:12.826 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was captured by the Taliban,
and finally
released in a prisoner swap last
year. Bergdahl's

03:18.598 --> 03:23.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appearance today came in a brief
hearing at
Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An Army spokesman summed up
afterward.

03:25.439 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DANIEL KING, U.S. Army: The
judge explained
Sergeant Bergdahl's right to be
tried before

03:29.609 --> 03:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a panel or a military judge. The
judge also
inquired if Sergeant Bergdahl
wished to enter

03:35.882 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any motions or a plea at this
time. Sergeant
Bergdahl deferred all of these
decisions to

03:43.857 --> 03:45.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a later hearing.

03:45.826 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bergdahl could
get life in
prison if he's convicted at a
general court-martial.

03:50.363 --> 03:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first body has been pulled
from the muddy
rubble of a landslide disaster
in Southern

03:55.469 --> 04:01.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China. Search teams in Shenzhen
found the
remains today, and continued
hunting for at

04:01.208 --> 04:08.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least 70 people still missing. A
wave of earth
and construction waste swallowed
33 buildings

04:08.081 --> 04:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Sunday, despite longstanding
warnings the
site posed a threat.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe's migrant crisis reached
a staggering
record today. The
director-general of the

04:18.492 --> 04:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
International Organization for
Migration announced
the new numbers in Geneva.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM LACY SWING,
Director-General, International
Organization for Migration: We
have just published

04:25.665 --> 04:32.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the figures of the one --
passing the one
million mark for the number of
refugees and

04:32.105 --> 04:39.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other migrants heading north
into Europe,
primarily out of Syria, but
other areas also,

04:39.112 --> 04:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and of that number, the death
total is very
close to 3,700.

04:43.950 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just today, 11
more people
drowned when a boat carrying
migrants to Greece

04:50.056 --> 04:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sank off the western coast of
Turkey. Seven
others were rescued by the
Turkish coast guard.

04:56.163 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street moved higher for
a second
day, as oil prices rose. The Dow
Jones industrial

05:01.568 --> 05:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 165 points to
close at 17417.
The Nasdaq rose 32, and the S&amp;P
500 added

05:10.544 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearly 18.

05:12.612 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour,"
a first in
commercial space exploration; no
indictments

05:18.251 --> 05:28.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Sandra Bland case; a
review of the
year in U.S. foreign policy; and
much more.

05:28.295 --> 05:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Sandra Bland case; a
review of the
year in U.S. foreign policy; and
much more.

05:37.938 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a long time since a
rocket's descent
has been big news, but, last
night, there

05:43.276 --> 05:49.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a historic landing. After
SpaceX, a private
company founded by Elon Musk,
launched a rocket

05:49.816 --> 05:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Monday from Cape Canaveral in
Florida,
it stuck the landing, you might
say. The rocket

05:55.422 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
booster landed gently on Earth,
a feat cheered
at SpaceX headquarters, and that
suggested

06:02.128 --> 06:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we may be able to create
reusable rockets
to explore further.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
joins me now.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Miles.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, how big a deal is this?

06:12.239 --> 06:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Judy, this is the
Holy Grail
for space.

06:15.875 --> 06:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since the space age began,
those of us
who cared about exploring beyond
have thought,

06:22.916 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't it be nice if we could
reuse the
craft? We have been throwing
them away virtually

06:27.153 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the whole time. The space
shuttle was an attempt
to make it reusable. Didn't work
out so well.

06:31.858 --> 06:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea that you could
take the first
stage of a rocket, kind of the
money end of

06:36.396 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rocket, if you will, and
have it land
intact gently to be fueled up,
gassed up and

06:42.969 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
launched again is truly a great
moment. So,
yes, big deal.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why was it so
hard to do before
now?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, part of it
is, we didn't
try for a long time. During the
heady days

06:53.813 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the space race, we were too
busy trying
to beat the Soviets to the
surface of the

06:58.118 --> 07:02.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moon, and so we were very happy
just to throw
things away, rather than try to
figure this

07:02.722 --> 07:04.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a penalty. You have to
have extra
fuel on obviously to bring it
down safely.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we got kind of off on a
tangent with
the space shuttle, thinking that
would be

07:10.964 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reusable, and that didn't work
out so well.
So we sort of didn't think about
it.

07:13.867 --> 07:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we went in the wrong
direction. And now
with entrepreneurs like Elon
Musk and Jeff

07:18.505 --> 07:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bezos looking at this idea in a
more bottom-line
manner than NASA would, dare I
say, we might

07:25.512 --> 07:27.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get some progress.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now, does
this mean it's
easy to do that, to land a
rocket back on

07:31.251 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Earth?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Nothing in space
is easy.

07:34.187 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is like balancing a
broom pole on
your nose, and only harder, lots
harder. So,

07:41.528 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, it's been proven now. The
trick is, if
you really want to make it
cost-effective,

07:46.966 --> 07:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to do this a lot,
because, frankly,
if you're only going to launch a
few times

07:51.271 --> 07:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year, you might as well just
throw away
the pieces.

07:53.673 --> 07:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're really going to
ramp up and
think about accessing space on a
routine basis,

07:59.245 --> 08:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having reusable first stages,
having reusable
pieces of these rockets really
becomes a game-changer.

08:05.251 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what does it
mean for the
future of spaceflight? What does
this mean

08:09.422 --> 08:16.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can now be attempted that
looked a little
farther off in the future until
now?

08:16.229 --> 08:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, well, this
will -- look,
on the big picture here, what
we're seeing

08:19.532 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here is low Earth orbit changing
dramatically.
It's not unlike what happened
with the Internet,

08:24.771 --> 08:30.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
built by the government, handed
over to Silicon
Valley, and, poof, we get
Facebook and Instagram.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kind of like that anyhow.

08:32.479 --> 08:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now what we're seeing in space
is, NASA is
stepping out of low Earth orbit
and is handing

08:36.950 --> 08:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over that domain to the likes of
Elon Musk
and Jeff Bezos and Richard
Branson, who are

08:41.988 --> 08:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to make businesses out of
this. And
that's exciting. It means NASA
can use its

08:46.159 --> 08:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limited resources to do what it
should do,
go over the hill to the next
horizon. In this

08:51.698 --> 08:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, I would like to see them
go to Mars.
And that's where they say
they're headed.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need the funding to do
that. They need
the focus. And they don't need
to be spending

08:58.571 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of time flying taxis and
freighters
into low Earth orbit. Instead,
there are private

09:04.577 --> 09:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies that are willing to do
it, and they're
doing it faster, better and
cheaper.

09:08.248 --> 09:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you mentioned
these other
entrepreneurs who are trying,
Jeff Bezos,

09:12.552 --> 09:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has his own company. They
landed -- I
guess they landed a rocket
recently had been

09:16.589 --> 09:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in suborbital -- had been in
suborbit, whatever
the term is, but -- so you have
this competition.

09:24.697 --> 09:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that mean for the
future? Does that
mean we're likely to see more
attempts like

09:28.768 --> 09:30.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Competition is
always good.
It's what got us to the moon,
after all.

09:32.639 --> 09:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we lost that space race,
NASA kind of
got lost in space, if you will.
Now that we

09:39.312 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have viable, private enterprise
competing
and getting into Twitter wars
over who is

09:45.018 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing a better job of it,
frankly, which is
very entertaining to see
billionaires go at

09:49.189 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it on Twitter, when you see that
kind of thing,
that's really exciting. That
means that there

09:53.960 --> 09:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might be a real business here.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Suborbital flight
was what
I was trying to say.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, space is getting
exciting all
over again.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, indeed,
suborbital or
orbital, Judy.

10:06.239 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:06.873 --> 10:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

10:09.709 --> 10:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

10:18.952 --> 10:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn once
again to the
national conversation around
policing, criminal

10:27.760 --> 10:29.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
justice and race.

10:29.562 --> 10:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest development of note:
a decision
by a grand jury in Texas not to
indict anyone

10:35.068 --> 10:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet in connection with the death
of an African-American
woman while she was in custody.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

10:42.208 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRELL JORDAN, Prosecutor: This
case is very
big for the citizens of Waller
County. It

10:46.646 --> 10:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is even bigger for the family of
Sandra Bland.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Prosecutor
Darrell Jordan speaking
last night.

10:53.019 --> 11:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRELL JORDAN: We have left no
rock unturned.
And the grand jury, anything
that they have

11:01.528 --> 11:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked for, we have done our best
to get it
to them.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That grand jury's
decision
effectively cleared sheriff's
officials and

11:07.066 --> 11:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jail employees of criminal
wrongdoings in
Bland's death. As captured on
video, the Chicago-area

11:15.041 --> 11:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman was pulled over by a Texas
state trooper
in July for making an improper
lane change.

11:21.047 --> 11:26.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It quickly turned into a
confrontation, as
Bland refused to get out of her
car, and trooper

11:26.352 --> 11:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brian Encinia brandished a stun
gun.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN ENCINIA, Texas State
Trooper: Get out
of the car! I will light you up!
Get down!

11:32.325 --> 11:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDRA BLAND, Arrested: Wow.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bland remained in
jail when
she could not raise $500 dollars
bail, and

11:37.564 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three days later, her body was
found hanging
in her cell. The local medical
examiner called

11:42.602 --> 11:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it a suicide, but the family
rejected that
finding. And shortly before
yesterday's decision,

11:49.008 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bland's family charged the grand
jury was
a -- quote -- "sham proceeding."

11:51.611 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENEVA REED-VEAL, Mother of
Sandra Bland:
It's the secrecy of it all. I
can't even begin

11:55.415 --> 12:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tell you what's going on,
because I myself
don't even know what's going on,
to not have

12:00.987 --> 12:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my counsel be privy to any of
this evidence
that is being presented.

12:06.092 --> 12:10.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There've been
similar outcomes
in several similar cases,
including Michael

12:10.763 --> 12:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown's death in Ferguson,
Missouri, where
a grand jury refused to indict a
white policeman,

12:16.936 --> 12:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus the Eric Garner choke hold
death on Staten
Island New York. Again, a grand
jury decided

12:22.408 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not to indict a white officer.

12:24.544 --> 12:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last week, a Baltimore judge
declared
a mistrial for the first officer
charged in

12:29.482 --> 12:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Freddie Gray's death in custody.
Back in Texas,
the prosecutor in the Bland case
says the

12:35.622 --> 12:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grand jury will reconvene next
month to consider
-- quote -- "other issues,"
possibly including

12:40.994 --> 12:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
charges against the trooper.

12:43.196 --> 12:48.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we get some further
reporting on the Sandra
Bland case and reactions to it
now from Molly

12:48.701 --> 12:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hennessy-Fiske, Houston bureau
chief for The
Los Angeles Times.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Molly, welcome back to the
program.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot here that we don't
know exactly
-- including exactly what the
grand jury was

12:59.278 --> 13:00.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looking at, right?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE, The Los
Angeles Times:
That's right.

13:02.348 --> 13:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The evidence presented to the
grand jury,
what the special prosecutor said
-- there's

13:06.753 --> 13:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a team of about five special
prosecutors,
independent prosecutors who have
been appointed

13:11.624 --> 13:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to present the evidence to the
grand jury.
I spoke to some of them, and
they said they

13:15.895 --> 13:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could share some information,
but they couldn't
address specifics.

13:18.297 --> 13:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The special
prosecutor said
the grand jury will reconvene in
January,

13:23.569 --> 13:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so what do we know about what
they will look
at then?

13:25.938 --> 13:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: Well, they
did say yesterday
after meeting all day for the
third time in

13:31.210 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
six weeks, the special
prosecutors came out
late in the evening and said
that there would

13:36.349 --> 13:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be no indictments returned
against the Waller
County Sheriff's Office or the
jail where

13:42.088 --> 13:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sandra Bland was held and where
her body was
found in her jail cell.

13:46.893 --> 13:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they said that the grand
jury wanted to
continue meeting, to continue
investigating,

13:51.431 --> 13:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they will reconvene January
6. I asked
them specifically whether they
would be addressing

13:56.869 --> 14:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the trooper who stopped Sandra
Bland, that
original traffic stop that
resulted in her

14:01.307 --> 14:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrest and her being take to the
jail. They
wouldn't respond directly to
address that.

14:07.547 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one of the specifics that
they said
they couldn't discuss. But it is
one of the

14:12.719 --> 14:14.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
matters that's still
outstanding.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And I gather that
supporters
of Sandra Bland are now
preparing or now calling

14:19.726 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for federal -- a federal role in
all of this.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: That's
right.

14:24.263 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, they called a meeting in
front of the
Waller County courthouse, which
is where the

14:28.568 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grand jury had been meeting
previously. The
supporters gathered there urge
and I talked

14:32.939 --> 14:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them ahead of time. They said
that they
planned to ask for the Justice
Department,

14:37.443 --> 14:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the federal government to get
involved and
have their own independent
investigation,

14:41.481 --> 14:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they said they don't
trust the local
officials, the grand jury, as
well as those

14:45.718 --> 14:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who are investigating the case.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Molly
Hennessy-Fiske,
the Houston bureau chief of The
Los Angeles

14:50.823 --> 14:51.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Times, thanks so much.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: Thanks for
having me.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we broaden the discussion
further now
with Brittany Packnett, an
organizer of Campaign

14:58.464 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zero, a group advocating for
police reform,
and Heather Mac Donald, a fellow
at the Manhattan

15:03.669 --> 15:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Institute, a policy think tank.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to welcome both of you.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start with you,
Brittany Packnett,
starting with Sandra Bland to
get a quick

15:10.977 --> 15:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reaction. Were you surprised by
the grand
jury's decision?

15:14.781 --> 15:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT, Ferguson
Commission Member:
I'm sadly not surprised. As an
activist and

15:19.152 --> 15:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protester from Ferguson and also
as a black
woman myself who videotapes
every single police

15:25.658 --> 15:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encounter that I have when I'm
pulled over,
because I live in that amount of
fear, I'm

15:29.796 --> 15:31.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sadly not surprised.

15:31.664 --> 15:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are millions of
Americans not surprised
by this outcome, and that should
concern us

15:35.034 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Heather Mac
Donald, your reaction?

15:37.970 --> 15:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD, Manhattan
Institute: Well,
there was no evidence that this
was a homicide,

15:41.340 --> 15:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey. This was a suicide, and
it's a tragic
case. It's heartbreaking that
Sandra Bland

15:47.346 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has died, but I don't know of
any evidence.
The coroner found that this was
a suicide.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether there was negligence on
the part of
the jail officials in not
keeping a close

15:58.191 --> 16:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough suicide watch on Ms.
Bland, who reported
that she had recently tried to
commit suicide

16:03.696 --> 16:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of a miscarriage, that
remains to
be seen, but I don't think
there's any evidence

16:07.900 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of criminal wrongdoing here.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Each case, of
course, has its
own specifics.

16:12.538 --> 16:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Brittany Packnett, you're
saying you're
not surprised because you see a
larger pattern

16:16.576 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

16:18.377 --> 16:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: Absolutely.
Over 1,000
people are killed each year by
police officers

16:22.181 --> 16:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, and this year
alone 14 police
departments killed black people
exclusively.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we see this trend
happening every single
day. And I find it fascinating
that black

16:32.725 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women can be forthright on
reality television
and it's entertaining, but when
we're forthright

16:37.463 --> 16:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our matters of constitutional
rights and
self-protection, it can be
deadly, as it was

16:42.134 --> 16:43.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Sandra Bland's case.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the very least, we need to be
looking at
the kinds of psychological
damage that she

16:47.373 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffered at the hands of what
happened to
her, both during her arrest and
during her

16:51.277 --> 16:54.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jailing, and, quite frankly, she
never should
have been arrested in the first
place.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why do you think
-- let me
just stay with you, Brittany
Packnett. Why

16:57.617 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you think these indictments
are hard to
get?

17:00.019 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I believe
these indictments
are hard to get because there is
a systemic

17:04.991 --> 17:06.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
issue at play.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have evidence of that
systemic issue. We
have done that research at
Campaign Zero.

17:10.229 --> 17:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We continue to see evidence that
the criminal
justice system
disproportionately jails black

17:15.234 --> 17:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and brown people in the issue of
mass incarceration.
And so we know that this system
was never

17:20.606 --> 17:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
built for folks like us. And we
know that
it continues to prevail against
us.

17:25.511 --> 17:29.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the reason why this can
continue is
because the system has never
stopped it.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
Heather Mac Donald,
what's your response to that? Do
you see a

17:33.119 --> 17:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
systemic issue here or a case by
case?

17:36.022 --> 17:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: If this is
an example
of an indictment that somehow
should have

17:40.793 --> 17:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been brought against the police
officer for
murder, that's ridiculous.

17:44.096 --> 17:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That explains why there aren't
many indictments
of police officers for murder.
This officer,

17:48.668 --> 17:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Encinia, was clearly not fit
psychologically
for the force. He lost it. He
completely lost

17:54.941 --> 18:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his cool when he was faced with
alleged contempt
of cop, but he's not responsible
for the death

18:00.813 --> 18:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Sandra Bland. This was a
suicide.

18:02.982 --> 18:09.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The causal reasoning here is so
remarkably
attenuated. Yes, blacks are
over-represented

18:09.822 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the prison population, but
study after
study has shown that that is
completely a

18:14.293 --> 18:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
function of their elevated rates
of black
crime. If we want to save black
lives, which

18:19.298 --> 18:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all should, the best thing to
do is to
support the police, who have
been responsible

18:24.136 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for a 50 percent drop in
homicides over the
last 20 years, the main
beneficiaries of which

18:30.242 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been law-abiding black
residents of inner-city
neighborhoods.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you arguing,
Heather Mac
Donald, that the justice system
is working

18:37.183 --> 18:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as it should in these cases?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: I am arguing
that.

18:40.820 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, I don't see any
sign of a miscarriage
of justice. What we need to be
focusing on

18:46.892 --> 18:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the six -- every day, 16
blacks are killed.
They're not killed by white
civilians. They're

18:53.032 --> 18:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not killed by the cops. They're
killed by
gun violence.

18:57.470 --> 19:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In September, three children
under the age
of 5 were killed in Cleveland,
leading the

19:03.542 --> 19:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police chief there to beg in
tears for attention
to what's happening in the
streets.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: In
Cincinnati in July...

19:10.316 --> 19:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I would like
to respond
to that.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: ... two
children were
killed.

19:12.451 --> 19:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Brittany Packnett.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I would like
to respond
to that. Thank you.

19:15.821 --> 19:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we know is that gun
violence absolutely
presents tragedies every single
day, but if

19:21.127 --> 19:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black lives really matter to
people like Heather
Mac Donald and other people who
insist that

19:25.164 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black-on-black crime is the real
issue, then
pay attention to poverty, pay
attention to

19:29.035 --> 19:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues of education, and pay
attention to
the fact that, according to the
research we

19:33.439 --> 19:37.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have analyzed at Campaign Zero,
there is no
correlation between community
violence and

19:37.176 --> 19:38.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police violence.

19:38.944 --> 19:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, in many departments
where there have
been a high incidence of police
violence,

19:43.849 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's been a low incidence of
community
violence, and the opposite can
be said of

19:47.853 --> 19:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many other departments. So we
actually see
no correlation between those
things.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the day, we know
police violence
is not the only thing plaguing
our communities.

19:55.895 --> 19:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, police violence is what
has killed
Sandra Bland. And she never
should have been

19:59.365 --> 20:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arrested in the first place.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Heather Mac
Donald, respond
to that, that she's pulling
apart the argument

20:04.870 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you just made, that one
thing can exist,
but there can also be -- there
can also be

20:09.341 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what she's talking about.

20:11.110 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: Police
violence didn't
kill Sandra Bland. This was a
police stop

20:17.349 --> 20:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a driving infraction that
went horribly
awry, but Sandra Bland committed
suicide three

20:23.489 --> 20:25.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
days later.

20:25.291 --> 20:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is simply no causal
connection between
officer Encinia and Sandra
Bland's death,

20:29.095 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as horrible as Sandra Bland's
death is and
as tragic a loss to her family.
The nation

20:35.034 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spends $1 trillion a year on
inner-city communities
and trying to uplift people from
poverty.

20:42.007 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has not worked. What has
worked is proactive
policing, and the police are not
racist. There

20:47.947 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been some horrible
individual instances
in this last year, but that is a
drop in the

20:53.219 --> 20:57.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bucket compared to the daily
violence that
is taking black lives.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We just have less
than a minute.

20:59.425 --> 21:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brittany Packnett, I just want
to ask you,
in the Sandra Bland case, there
are now calls

21:03.095 --> 21:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a federal role. Do you think
that -- it's
important? Would that make a
difference?

21:06.332 --> 21:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I think
that's absolutely
essentially.

21:08.734 --> 21:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we can't get away
from the basic
fact that if officer Encinia
hadn't been confrontational

21:13.539 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Sandra Bland and had not
arrested her
for failing the use a traffic
signal, she

21:17.810 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't be dead. So, to say
that there is
no causal relationship is simply
inaccurate.

21:21.347 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, very
briefly, Heather
Mac Donald, what do you think
about the federal

21:24.216 --> 21:25.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: I think it's
completely
unnecessary here.

21:28.721 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no sign of a pattern of
practice in
this case of civil rights
violations. It's

21:36.195 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- there's simply not any kind
of legal case
for causation here on the part
of officer

21:41.133 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Encinia or the police department
or highway
patrol from which he comes.

21:46.372 --> 21:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, everybody wants to
protect black lives,
and the best way to do that is
for policing

21:51.377 --> 21:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to protect inner-city
community from
gun violence.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right. All
right. We do
have to leave it.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: The best way
to do that
is to acknowledge what we live
with every

21:57.583 --> 21:58.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
single day.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right. We
have to leave
it there.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Brittany
Packnett, Heather
Mac Donald, thank you both very
much.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: Thank you.

22:03.956 --> 22:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEATHER MAC DONALD: Thank you.

22:12.698 --> 22:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
drug that's
prompted a record number of
calls to poison

22:21.974 --> 22:29.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control; the NFL player who gave
up his career
because of concussions; and why
musician Lera

22:29.048 --> 22:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lynn sings about the darker side
of things.

22:32.151 --> 22:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, as the year comes to
an end, we
thought it would be a good idea
to take stock

22:37.456 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and look back at America's
diplomatic accomplishments
and setbacks of 2015.

22:45.497 --> 22:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was another bloody year
across the Middle
East, in Afghanistan and on the
African continent.

22:52.271 --> 22:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian civil war entered its
fourth year,
and, in September, Russia
intervened to support

22:58.544 --> 23:05.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Syria's President Bashar
al-Assad with airstrikes
that mostly hit rebels backed by
the U.S.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and its allies.

23:08.053 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Iraqi government
troops joined
with Kurdish forces, and with
U.S. ground

23:13.259 --> 23:19.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and air support, began to beat
back Islamic
State fighters. As the year
ended, the Iraqis

23:19.431 --> 23:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were moving to recapture Ramadi.

23:21.934 --> 23:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But ISIS did hold on to much of
its territory
in Syria. And that helped send a
flood of

23:28.407 --> 23:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees and migrants from Syria
into Europe,
along with tens of thousands
from Africa and

23:35.481 --> 23:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asia. Tensions over migrants
crescendoed when
terrorists went on a rampage in
Paris, killing

23:42.955 --> 23:46.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
130 and wounding hundreds more.

23:46.792 --> 23:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, the fighting in
Eastern Ukraine
between Russian-backed
separatists and the

23:51.897 --> 23:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government subsided to some
extent after a
cease-fire agreement was reached
in Minsk,

23:58.003 --> 24:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belarus. But, in Asia, tensions
rose between
China and the United States and
countries

24:04.743 --> 24:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the region, as Beijing built
up artificial
islands, complete with military
runways.

24:12.918 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still, there were major
diplomatic agreements
reached in 2015 as well. Iran
agreed to curtail

24:21.994 --> 24:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its nuclear program in exchange
for the lifting
of economic sanctions. The
United States and

24:27.833 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cuba reopened embassies in each
other's capitals
and reestablished diplomatic
relations. Twelve

24:34.873 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pacific Rim countries concluded
the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade agreement,
which lowers

24:41.313 --> 24:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tariffs; 195 countries struck a
landmark climate
deal in Paris. It aims to cut
manmade emissions

24:50.189 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and slow global warming.

24:52.458 --> 24:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just last week, the U.N.
Security Council
approved a framework for trying
to end the

24:58.297 --> 25:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian civil war.

25:00.499 --> 25:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, is the U.S. better off from
a national
security perspective than it was
a year ago?

25:07.139 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we get the views of
two people with
extensive foreign policy making
experience.

25:12.811 --> 25:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wendy Sherman was undersecretary
of state
for political affairs during the
Obama administration.

25:18.550 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was the lead U.S. negotiator
to the Iran
nuclear talks, and is now an
adviser to the

25:24.323 --> 25:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton campaign. And
Richard Haass
served in both Bush
administrations. He's

25:30.496 --> 25:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now the president of the Council
on Foreign
Relations.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both to the
program.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wendy Sherman, let me start with
you that.

25:38.504 --> 25:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That fundamental question, is
the U.S. better
off today from a national
security perspective?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
You know,

25:43.976 --> 25:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I think, in many ways, we
are, with
one glaring exception, and that
is ISIL and

25:48.113 --> 25:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrorist threat. And that's
a glaring
exception because it's created
such anxiety,

25:52.284 --> 25:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and understandably so, among the
American
people.

25:55.020 --> 26:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our economy is in better
shape. We have
stopped Iran from having a
nuclear weapon.

26:00.125 --> 26:06.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have improved our
relationships with Cuba,
which is having a knock-on
effect on Venezuela.

26:06.231 --> 26:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have created some development
opportunities,
and we have also agreed on TPP,
the Trans-Pacific

26:12.037 --> 26:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Partnership, with 12 countries
in Asia, which
is very critical to our economic
future.

26:17.209 --> 26:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to
touch on a number
of those, Richard Haass, but the
big picture,

26:21.246 --> 26:23.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the U.S. better off?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS, President,
Council on Foreign
Relations: Sad to say, I would
say not, in

26:25.717 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part because of the things that
have actually
happened -- and Wendy mentioned
them -- the

26:28.921 --> 26:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biggest one, the Middle East,
dwarfs the other
in the immediate effects, and it
also added

26:34.660 --> 26:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to such things as a resurgent
global terrorism,
as well as the refugee flood in
Europe.

26:40.732 --> 26:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most of the things on the
good side are
still to come. I hope TPP
becomes a reality,

26:47.139 --> 26:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that depends upon Congress
in 2016. Paris,
the climate change agreement is
more promise

26:53.645 --> 26:55.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than reality.

26:55.481 --> 26:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dealing with the
Islamic State,
Iraq, Syria, how has the
administration done?

26:59.485 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: I was critical of
the previous
administration, even though I
was part of

27:03.255 --> 27:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, for what it did in 2003 in
launching the
Iraq War, and I think that added
to the region's

27:08.627 --> 27:10.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
instability.

27:10.362 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what -- largely what
Mr. Obama
has not done, in particular in
Syria, but

27:14.466 --> 27:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also elsewhere in not following
up in Libya
after removing the regime, in
initially saying

27:21.106 --> 27:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all U.S. forces were going to
have to get
out of Afghanistan and taking
U.S. forces

27:25.043 --> 27:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of Iraq. In many ways, an
overreaction
to the previous American
administration, and

27:30.516 --> 27:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all this coupled with the
pathologies, if
you will, of the region itself
have left the

27:35.053 --> 27:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Middle East overall in some ways
in terrible
shape.

27:37.956 --> 27:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have compared it to the 30
Years War that
decimated Europe in the 17th
century.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wendy Sherman,
like the 30
Years War?

27:44.796 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: I think we have
to say that
President Obama has all the
right elements

27:48.500 --> 27:50.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in place.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we need to do -- what he's
trying to
do is pick up the pace of those
elements,

27:53.105 --> 27:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so whether that's a military
effort. And,
today, we see the Iraqi army
going into Ramadi,

27:58.443 --> 28:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is very important, to take
that back
from ISIL. We have picked up the
pace on foreign

28:03.181 --> 28:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters, on financing, on
attacking oil depots
that ISIL holds on to, looking
at recruitment,

28:09.588 --> 28:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing with social media, and
the diplomatic
effort.

28:12.824 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just saw U.N. Security
Council come together
for the first time in a long
time to agree

28:18.263 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a diplomatic way forward. So
we have got
the elements in place, but we
have to pick

28:22.367 --> 28:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up the pace of getting the job
done.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Haass,
Afghanistan
is a very different place. But
we also know

28:28.340 --> 28:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that ISIS has some presence
there. How do
you judge the -- the president
has now said

28:33.045 --> 28:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's going to keep U.S. troops
there longer
than he had said earlier. How do
you see Afghanistan

28:37.950 --> 28:39.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going?

28:39.851 --> 28:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Not very well, in
large part
because, as you say, ISIS has
put down a toehold.

28:44.389 --> 28:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You still have the Taliban. They
still enjoy
a sanctuary in Western Pakistan,
which has

28:50.295 --> 28:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really undermined the U.S.
effort for more
than a decade now.

28:53.532 --> 28:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, you got to deal with all
the ethnic
fault lines of Afghanistan's own
politics

28:58.103 --> 29:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and society. And I think again
we hurt ourselves
by raising questions about the
duration of

29:04.343 --> 29:09.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American commitment. But I
will be honest
with you, Judy. Even without
such questions,

29:09.181 --> 29:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan is just one of the
wrong places
in the world to get overly
ambitious about.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You want to
comment?

29:14.252 --> 29:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, I think the
comment here
is that we should feel good that
Ashraf Ghani

29:18.357 --> 29:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his CEO, vice president,
Abdullah Abdullah,
have kept it together, that
there is a political

29:24.896 --> 29:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
process in place, that there is
a fight that's
going on.

29:27.933 --> 29:33.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this is a very tough
long-term effort,
not only in Afghanistan and the
Middle East,

29:33.171 --> 29:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but throughout the world,
because, besides
ISIL, we have -- still have
al-Qaida, AQAP,

29:39.945 --> 29:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab, and we
have got to
make efforts on all of these
places all over

29:45.350 --> 29:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the would, but we can't forget
the good that's
happening, as well as the bad.

29:49.321 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Wendy
Sherman, you worked,
as we said, for a long time on
this Iran nuclear

29:54.292 --> 29:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal. We're now in a different
phase of that,
but, at this point, how is it
going?

29:59.097 --> 30:02.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, we're
getting to implementation
of the deal.

30:02.467 --> 30:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're being very tough about
it. Iran
made specific commitments in
this agreement.

30:08.540 --> 30:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have got to follow
through on all
of those commitments. So I think
we are hopeful

30:14.179 --> 30:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deal will ensure that Iran
cannot get
a nuclear weapon, not for 10
years, not for

30:18.950 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
15 years, but forever.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Haass,
the Iran deal?

30:22.120 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: I agree in part
with what Wendy
said, but also disagree.

30:25.157 --> 30:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where I think it does make
things better is
for the next 10 or 15 years. It
significantly

30:29.761 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduces Iranian capabilities in
the nuclear
area. At the same time, on the
other side

30:35.701 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the ledger, it gives Iran
access to far
more resources than it otherwise
would have

30:39.671 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access to, to pursue a foreign
policy that
in many cases is inimical to our
own interests.

30:45.544 --> 30:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I actually think the biggest
questions
come after the 10- and 15-year
time limits

30:49.715 --> 30:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and dealing with centrifuges and
enriched
uranium. And I just don't think
Wendy or anyone

30:55.020 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else can say that we're for sure
or confident
that Iran can't have a nuclear
weapon at that

31:00.192 --> 31:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point. The quantitative and
qualitative limits
come off and we just have to
hope that the

31:05.030 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspections and our willingness
to react,
if indeed we see Iran moving
toward a nuclear

31:09.534 --> 31:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapon again, that that's
enough.

31:11.603 --> 31:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I realize
I'm asking
you both to deal with some very
big questions

31:15.607 --> 31:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a short period of time, but,
Richard Haass,
what about -- and I don't want
to lump them

31:19.544 --> 31:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, but what about Russia
and China?
These are two big countries,
very different

31:25.183 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenges they pose to the
United States.
But where do you see the U.S.
headed with

31:28.720 --> 31:29.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these two?

31:29.921 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RICHARD HAASS: Difficult
relationships with
both, Judy.

31:33.158 --> 31:37.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're seeing in some ways
is the revival
of elements of great power
politics. And in

31:37.963 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both cases, you have leaders,
which worries
me, who are quite unconstrained
by bureaucratic

31:42.934 --> 31:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or organizational factors. They
each have
tremendous freedom of action.

31:47.939 --> 31:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia has seems to have moved
somewhat its
focus from playing around in
Ukraine to the

31:54.713 --> 31:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle East, and we will just
have to see
whether over time they're
willing to play

31:58.383 --> 32:04.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a responsible role in taking on
ISIS. So far,
we have not seen much of any of
that. China

32:04.222 --> 32:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continues to try to become more
of a regional
power, and I think, there, the
administration

32:08.693 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was right to do the overflights,
to do the
freedom of navigation cruises,
to push back

32:14.232 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against China and to reassure
our allies,
in particular Japan.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wendy Sherman,
Russia, China?

32:19.471 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: I think these are
going to
be very difficult relationships,
as Richard

32:22.274 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says. This is all about really
wary engagement.
These are important powers.

32:27.312 --> 32:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They each have roles, not only
regionally,
but in the world. They're both
permanent members

32:31.616 --> 32:36.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Security Council. They
both have veto
power in the Security Council.
So we're going

32:36.087 --> 32:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have to deal with them, work
with them
where we can, on climate with
China, on the

32:40.859 --> 32:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran deal, and hopefully on
Syria with both
Russia and China.

32:45.163 --> 32:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And where we can't, where Russia
invaded,
Ukraine took -- tried to take
Crimea permanently

32:51.536 --> 32:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into its own orbit, we are going
to have to
be as tough as we are. And we
invoked new

32:55.173 --> 32:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions today yet again on
Russia because
of what they have done in
Ukraine, so wary

32:59.578 --> 33:01.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
engagement.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, and very
quickly,
we're going into a presidential
election year.

33:04.716 --> 33:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do each of you believe you
are most hopeful
about and most worried about
going into this

33:11.122 --> 33:11.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wendy Sherman?

33:13.625 --> 33:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: The American
people are really
hopeful folks, and even though
they are concerned

33:16.294 --> 33:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this terrorism threat, the
vast majority
of people want to proceed
forward.

33:20.131 --> 33:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want this economy to
improve. They want
the gap between the rich and the
poor to diminish.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to make sure they're
safe and secure,
but they want their kids to have
a better

33:28.773 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future. And that's what they
want to be focused
on. So I just hope that the
rhetoric of this

33:32.844 --> 33:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign doesn't go out ahead of
where the
American people really are and
what they hope

33:37.249 --> 33:38.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Haass,
finally, 2016?

33:40.085 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Most hopeful that
we can get
passage of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade

33:44.689 --> 33:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement. Even more than the
economics of
that, Judy, it's strategically
essential,

33:48.927 --> 33:52.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if America is going to once
again look to
be reliable and predictable.

33:52.998 --> 33:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm most worried about,
there, it's a
long list, beginning obviously
with the Middle

33:57.435 --> 34:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East, but also the levels of
growth around
the world and then always the
possibility

34:02.274 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a surprise. We have not
mentioned North
Korea. We haven't mentioned
Pakistan. We haven't

34:06.745 --> 34:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really talked much about the
possibility of
domestic terrorism.

34:09.314 --> 34:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's a lot of clouds over
the 2016
horizon, unfortunately.

34:12.851 --> 34:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Richard
Haass, Wendy
Sherman, tackling the whole
world for us,

34:18.189 --> 34:18.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you both.

34:18.823 --> 34:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you.

34:19.457 --> 34:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Thank you.

34:23.561 --> 34:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we have
a story on
the rise of the drug synthetic
marijuana,

34:33.605 --> 34:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we have
a story on
the rise of the drug synthetic
marijuana,

34:38.910 --> 34:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
commonly known as Spice or K2.

34:41.713 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year has seen a record
number of calls
to poison control regarding the
substance,

34:46.785 --> 34:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and law enforcement around the
country are
learning how to cope with the
unpredictable,

34:51.656 --> 34:53.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dangerous drug.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now learn more about this
deadly cocktail
from "PBS NewsHour"
correspondent William

34:57.128 --> 34:58.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brangham.

34:58.897 --> 35:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Tonight, a local teen's
personal account
of his addiction to the
synthetic drug K2.

35:03.735 --> 35:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: But this legal weed can
have extreme,
dangerous medical side effects.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY, Used Synthetic Marijuana:
I hit it
two times.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Wrappers that look just
like this.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY: And then I don't remember
anything.

35:12.510 --> 35:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Just as dangerous as pot,
cocaine or
meth, but one scary difference:
Your kids

35:17.182 --> 35:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can buy it at local stores.

35:19.050 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY: I remember, I woke up in
the hospital.
My throat hurt so bad, and I was
like, why

35:24.322 --> 35:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is my throat hurting? And that
was because
they had to put a tube down my
throat, because

35:29.394 --> 35:31.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't breathe.

35:31.162 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Synthetic marijuana.

35:32.931 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY: Then my mom told me what
happened,
and, apparently, I had a seizure
at the park.

35:38.236 --> 35:42.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Sixteen-year-old Molly is
a resident at the Mountain Manor
Treatment

35:42.307 --> 35:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center in Baltimore, and she's
here because
of her experience using
so-called synthetic

35:46.911 --> 35:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marijuana, or what they call
fake pot.

35:49.848 --> 35:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Synthetic marijuana comes
with a quick
and powerful high, but it comes
with a price.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These drugs
have been in
the news a lot lately, but,
despite their

35:56.721 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
street name, they're not at all
like actual
marijuana.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. KAMA TILLMAN, Howard
University Hospital:
Even that the term says
synthetic marijuana,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not marijuana. The effects
are completely
different.

36:04.963 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Kama
Tillman works the
emergency room at Howard
University Hospital

36:08.867 --> 36:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington, D.C., and he's
seen a surge
in the number of patients coming
through his

36:13.204 --> 36:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doors suffering ill effects from
these synthetic
drugs.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. KAMA TILLMAN: They're
belligerent. They're
wild. Their body's just moving
around, but

36:20.545 --> 36:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can't control it, and
requires maybe
people to kind of help keep them
calm, so

36:25.083 --> 36:29.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they don't harm themselves
or harm anybody
else. You get a lot more people
who get that

36:29.487 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agitation, the psychosis, the
paranoia, even
convulsions, and even in some
cases death

36:35.427 --> 36:37.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from this drug.

36:37.328 --> 36:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There were at
least 15 deaths
from synthetic drugs in the
first five months

36:41.599 --> 36:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this year, and experts stress
the difficulty
of tracking the harm from these
unfamiliar

36:46.071 --> 36:47.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
substances.

36:47.772 --> 36:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were also a record number
of calls to
poison control centers, at least
7,000 so

36:51.876 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far this year, specifically
related to synthetic
drugs.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS, National
Institute on
Drug Abuse: I think this is the
emerging face

36:57.649 --> 36:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of drug abuse for the future.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Marilyn
Huestis is a
toxicologist at the National
Institute on

37:03.822 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Drug Abuse, and she and her team
study the
chemical makeup of synthetic
drugs.

37:07.826 --> 37:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS: The big
problem is, new
drugs come out, and they're very
potent, up

37:14.365 --> 37:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to 100 times as potent as
cannabis.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A hundred
times as potent?

37:19.037 --> 37:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS: Up to. Some
are 50 times.
Some are 100 times, the most
potent ones.

37:24.742 --> 37:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And she says
they're often
made in foreign facilities, with
an ever-changing

37:28.480 --> 37:30.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cocktail of chemicals.

37:30.381 --> 37:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS: It's like
taking a 1,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle and throwing it up
in the air

37:36.187 --> 37:41.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and having to put it back
together without
a picture. That's what we're
trying to do.

37:41.326 --> 37:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Synthetic
marijuana was
originally created for research
purposes in

37:46.431 --> 37:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 1990s by a chemist named
John Huffman.
But manufacturers soon realized
they could

37:51.402 --> 37:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take Huffman's chemical recipe,
spray it onto
chopped-up plants and then sell
it to consumers.

37:56.975 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With brand names like K2, and
Spice and Scooby
Snax, these synthetic drugs were
originally

38:02.247 --> 38:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sold in gas stations and smoke
shops as a
-- quote, unquote -- "legal
alternative" to

38:07.418 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marijuana. But as evidence of
the drug's harms
grew, public officials began
cracking down.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some cities, like Washington,
D.C., have been
revoking the licenses of
retailers caught

38:16.794 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selling the drugs. D.C. has also
mounted a
big ad campaign to scare kids
away from the

38:21.900 --> 38:23.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: It's like we're a bunch
of lab rats
injecting unknown and harmful
chemicals into

38:26.137 --> 38:30.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our bodies just to get a quick
high. And they
make a quick profit at our
expense.

38:30.842 --> 38:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Marc
Fishman treats
adolescent addictions at the
Mountain Manor

38:35.747 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center, and he says another
reason why synthetics
took off several years ago is
that they're

38:39.851 --> 38:41.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hard to detect.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARC FISHMAN, Mountain Manor
Treatment
Center: One of the issues that I
am sure you

38:43.454 --> 38:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have heard is that they don't
show up well
in urine drug tests. So, one of
the advantages

38:48.393 --> 38:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to some people is that they can
get away with
it.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You can get
high and not
get busted.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARC FISHMAN: Get high and
not busted.
Some of the kids will call it
probation weed.

38:55.533 --> 38:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRETT, ®MD-BO/Used Synthetic
Marijuana:
I first heard about it in high
school. So,

38:59.837 --> 39:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my buddies were doing it, and I
was smoking
weed at the time, so they told
me that there

39:06.110 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was something called synthetic
weed that didn't
come up on like drug tests. My
parents were

39:11.749 --> 39:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always on me. So, I remember the
first time
I tried it, I was in my buddy's
basement,

39:22.260 --> 39:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you know, just -- it made me
crazy.

39:24.262 --> 39:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Fishman
says that this
puzzling mix of chemicals, while
alarming

39:28.433 --> 39:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to researchers, can actually be
appealing
to adolescents.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARC FISHMAN: So, telling a
young person,
you don't know what you're
getting, be careful,

39:34.973 --> 39:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your brain might explode,
doesn't change the
momentary thrill seeking where
they're so...

39:39.844 --> 39:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That may sound
like a pitch
for the drug.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. MARC FISHMAN: Exactly,
exactly.

39:44.115 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY: I didn't look it up. I
didn't search
about it. I was like, this is
going to get

39:48.219 --> 39:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me high. That's -- that's really
all you're
thinking about.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The spread of
synthetics
has also caused challenges for
law enforcement.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Andrew Struhar is acting
lieutenant of the
narcotics unit of the
Washington, D.C., police.

39:58.796 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. ANDREW STRUHAR, Washington,
D.C., Police
Department: Two, three years
ago, this was

40:01.266 --> 40:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a legal substance, you know.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You could just
buy it in
a store.

40:05.169 --> 40:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. ANDREW STRUHAR: And it
wasn't scheduled
by the federal government, so,
therefore,

40:09.641 --> 40:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't a narcotic, really. It
had a narcotic
effect, but it was legal to
purchase, legal

40:15.413 --> 40:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to possess, legal to use.

40:17.715 --> 40:25.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, a lot of
agencies, whether
they be regulatory, law
enforcement or in

40:25.056 --> 40:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government legislature, are
trying to catch
up with, you know, what these
products are.

40:29.594 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All 50 states
have now outlawed
synthetic drugs in some way, but
the problem

40:33.731 --> 40:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, manufacturers keep changing
the chemical
makeup of the drugs to try and
skirt the laws

40:38.403 --> 40:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and claim their products aren't
technically
illegal. It becomes this
never-ending cat-and-mouse

40:43.207 --> 40:45.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
game.

40:45.109 --> 40:50.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, look, this one says,
complies with Senate
Bill 3187 and House Bill 1175,
legal schedule.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is claiming it's legal.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. ANDREW STRUHAR: Right. And
they do it
typically on the back, as you
can see on the

40:55.687 --> 40:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back. They go through all their
disclaimers,
and it says right on there
disclaimer. And

40:59.857 --> 41:01.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if you look at...

41:01.292 --> 41:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Sold as
incense only, not
for human consumption."

41:04.662 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LT. ANDREW STRUHAR: It's
designed specifically
for aromatic potpourri use. I
mean, nobody

41:09.267 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sells potpourri in 3.5 gram
packets.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:14.272 --> 41:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's not just
individual
sales. In a sign of the growing
scale of these

41:17.508 --> 41:23.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
operations, officials in
Washington, D.C.,
recently seized 265 pounds of
synthetics from

41:23.214 --> 41:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a D.C. warehouse. It was one of
the biggest
busts of its kind, a total
street value of

41:27.719 --> 41:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$2.3 million, according to
police.

41:30.955 --> 41:36.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as this formerly legal drug
retreats underground,
those who use it have also been
changing.

41:36.561 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police and clinicians note an
apparent decrease
in use among young and
middle-class users,

41:41.265 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a rise among vulnerable
groups like the
poor and the homeless, proof to
experts that

41:46.237 --> 41:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the threat of these drugs is far
from over
and the dangers still unknown.

41:50.341 --> 41:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS: It's a
major problem.
And we don't know. All these
people who are

41:54.712 --> 42:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying this now, what is this
doing to their
brains? What's it going to be
like in five

42:00.118 --> 42:01.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years, 10 years?

42:01.519 --> 42:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because we
just don't know
the answers to those...

42:03.388 --> 42:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARILYN HUESTIS: We don't
know. We don't
know. We don't have the
beginning of answers.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile, the
questions
just continue to pile up.

42:08.926 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

42:16.734 --> 42:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the risks of
concussion
and long-term brain injury from
football.

42:28.446 --> 42:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a subject that looms large
in a sport
that's arguably become the
national pastime,

42:34.085 --> 42:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it is very much back in the
news as the
film "Concussion" opens later
this week.

42:39.157 --> 42:43.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, "Frontline" has updated
its two-hour
special "League of Denial." It
includes a

42:43.995 --> 42:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new interview with a former
linebacker and
emerging star in the NFL who
captured attention

42:49.901 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when he walked away from the
game.

42:52.103 --> 42:56.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here's a look at some of
"Frontline"'s new
reporting about Borland.

42:56.707 --> 43:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: NFL star Chris Borland
was known
as a fearless player, but after
one season,

43:03.347 --> 43:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he quit because he was afraid of
head injuries.

43:06.651 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND, Former National
Football League
Player: I couldn't really
justify playing

43:10.988 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for money, and I think what I
wanted to achieve
put me at too great of a risk,
so I just decided

43:16.260 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on another profession.

43:18.162 --> 43:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Now Borland is called
the most dangerous
man in football, a powerful
symbol of the

43:23.901 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NFL's growing concussion crisis.

43:25.803 --> 43:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS NOWINSKI, Executive
Director, Concussion
Legacy Foundation: If the NFL is
smart, they're

43:28.506 --> 43:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scared of Chris Borland and the
people that
will come after them.

43:33.110 --> 43:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Like so many young
kids in America,
Borland grew up loving football.

43:38.149 --> 43:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: In a lot of ways,
I was born
into football. I knew it was
what I was going

43:42.553 --> 43:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. I loved it and stuck with
it and realized
my dream.

43:47.825 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: In high school, his
climb to the
NFL began on YouTube.

43:52.430 --> 43:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Chris Borland with a diving
tackle.

43:56.367 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The hit went viral.
Borland was
on his way to big-time college
football. The

44:03.140 --> 44:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University of Wisconsin's
promotional highlights
showcase number 44, Chris
Borland's aggressive

44:09.280 --> 44:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hits. After four seasons, pay
dirt.

44:15.686 --> 44:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The San Francisco 49ers
select Chris
Borland.

44:19.957 --> 44:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: It was a dream
come true. I
can remember my brothers jumping
up and hugging

44:24.862 --> 44:30.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. And it's surreal to see your
anymore across
the ticker and the analysts
start to talk

44:30.368 --> 44:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about you, and you're playing in
the NFL.

44:33.304 --> 44:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The 49ers gave him the
number 50
jersey, a four-year contract
worth nearly

44:38.876 --> 44:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$3 million, and a signing bonus
worth more
than $600,000.

44:42.847 --> 44:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE FAINARU, ESPN: He was just
a heat-seeking
missile, this guy. He was
looking at a long-term

44:48.619 --> 44:53.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career. Yes, he was looking at
everything
that the NFL brings you.

44:53.124 --> 44:59.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: But, as Borland was
becoming a star,
the NFL's concussion crisis was
hard to ignore.

44:59.397 --> 45:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE FAINARU: He began the
think about all
the violence that he was
inflicting and experiencing,

45:04.702 --> 45:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I think he found that
morally troublesome.

45:08.072 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: He began reading
everything he could
about the effects of football on
his brain.

45:12.843 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: I knew of CTE. I
didn't know
what the acronym stood for. I
started with

45:17.114 --> 45:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Google searches. I started
looking at things.
What does this term mean? Where
is the research

45:21.285 --> 45:22.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done?

45:22.219 --> 45:24.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: What he learned
terrified him.

45:24.689 --> 45:32.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: It's tough. I
mean, I -- you
understand on a certain level
what you're

45:32.463 --> 45:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing, but you don't know the
science behind
it.

45:35.967 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Borland then went even
further.
He called a leading brain
scientist at Boston

45:41.238 --> 45:43.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. ROBERT STERN, Boston
University CTE Center:
And, in football, one has to
expect that almost

45:46.077 --> 45:51.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every play of every game and
every practice,
they're going to be hitting
their heads against

45:51.349 --> 45:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other. Each time that
happens, it's around
20 g or more. That's the
equivalent of driving

45:58.489 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a car at 35 miles per hour into
a brick wall
1,000, 1,500 times per year.

46:04.261 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: After that call, that
very day,
Borland retired.

46:09.500 --> 46:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: The idea that
just the basis
of the game, repetitive hits,
bring on a cascade

46:16.007 --> 46:19.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of issues later in life, that
changed the
game for me.

46:19.310 --> 46:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Borland's decision to
leave the
nation's most powerful sports
league instantly

46:23.914 --> 46:25.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made headlines.

46:25.082 --> 46:28.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: San Francisco 49ers
linebacker Chris
Borland has...

46:28.552 --> 46:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Retired from NFL due to
concussion
concerns.

46:31.222 --> 46:37.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE FAINARU: This was a
massive blow. The
profound act of an NFL player
walking away

46:37.762 --> 46:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from $3 million and fame and a
chance to play
professional football, it's just
incalculable.

46:47.872 --> 46:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: At NFL headquarters,
they responded
immediately. Commissioner Roger
Goodell himself

46:55.012 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hit the airwaves to defend the
game.

46:56.981 --> 47:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER GOODELL, National Football
League Commissioner:
I think our game has never been
more exciting.

47:00.317 --> 47:04.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's never been more
competitive. And I don't
think it's ever been safer.

47:04.288 --> 47:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: It's dishonest,
and I don't
think it's responsible to say
that the game

47:10.061 --> 47:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is safer. I think that's just
not true, and
the players themselves on the
field know -- I

47:15.833 --> 47:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, they scoff at that. That's
not accurate.

47:18.769 --> 47:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: It's been a year since
he walked
away, the first fall in 10 years
Chris Borland

47:26.777 --> 47:28.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hasn't suited up.

47:28.612 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BORLAND: Last year, the
NFL commissioned
actuaries to estimate how many
NFL veterans

47:36.454 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have brain damage, and the
number they
came up with was three out of
10. So, if I

47:40.558 --> 47:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turn on a game and a third of
the guys will
have brain damage in life, I
just -- I can't

47:46.831 --> 47:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really support that.

47:48.766 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just don't really watch
football anymore.
If it's on, I may peek at it,
but I don't...

47:56.507 --> 48:00.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Frontline" did
ask the NFL
for a response.

48:00.311 --> 48:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the league said
-- quote -- "We
respect Chris Borland's decision
and wish

48:04.915 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him all the best. Playing any
sport is a personal
decision. By any measure,
football has never

48:10.855 --> 48:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been safer. And we continue to
make progress
with rule changes, safer
tackling techniques

48:16.927 --> 48:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and better equipment, protocols
and medical
care for players. Player safety
will be our

48:22.833 --> 48:24.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
top priority."

48:24.535 --> 48:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a reminder: You can watch
"Frontline"
tonight, right here on your PBS
station.

48:28.839 --> 48:34.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow night, we will have a
report on the
coming feature film "Concussion"
and the true

48:34.145 --> 48:39.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
story behind it.

48:39.116 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a new occasional
series here on the "NewsHour"
that gives artists

48:51.829 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an opportunity to talk about
their work. We
call it My Music.

48:56.367 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with Lera Lynn, an
up-and-coming
singer-songwriter featured in
the HBO series

49:02.106 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"True Detective" who recently
completed her
U.S. tour.

49:06.343 --> 49:15.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
Take
a listen:

49:15.052 --> 49:25.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LERA LYNN, Musician: There is
something really
attractive about darkness to me.

49:25.095 --> 49:34.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LERA LYNN, Musician: There is
something really
attractive about darkness to me.

49:34.505 --> 49:39.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have read studies that
listening to sad
music actually creates positive
emotion, so

49:39.610 --> 49:42.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm just trying to change the
world.

49:42.046 --> 49:42.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:43.013 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LERA LYNN: Just kidding.

49:46.884 --> 49:48.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:48.252 --> 49:59.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LERA LYNN: My name is Lera Lynn.
And I'm an
independent musician.

49:59.563 --> 50:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people that come into
the shows these
days have find out about me
through "True

50:04.935 --> 50:14.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Detective." Thankfully, they
have dug a little
bit more. I think that's the
best possible

50:14.979 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Detective." Thankfully, they
have dug a little
bit more. I think that's the
best possible

50:20.951 --> 50:27.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scenario for me.

50:27.491 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My family is Texan. And I think,
especially
now, I'm really starting to feel
the impact

50:35.499 --> 50:45.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their upbringing on me,
because it's coming
out of the music in a big way.
There's been

50:45.542 --> 50:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their upbringing on me,
because it's coming
out of the music in a big way.
There's been

50:57.288 --> 51:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of country music, a lot of
classic rock,
even jazz. My mom loved Joni
Mitchell.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was even, you know, a lot
of Van Halen
in the house.

51:07.197 --> 51:08.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:08.966 --> 51:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LERA LYNN: It is kind of all
over the place,
really. I think that's got a lot
to do with

51:11.902 --> 51:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why my style varies such a great
deal.

51:23.280 --> 51:28.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opening track from my latest
record, "The
Avenues," is called "Out to
Sea." And I had

51:28.619 --> 51:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a friend whose roommate had a
girlfriend who
was in love with him, and he was
really not

51:34.024 --> 51:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very into. And he broke it off
with her, and
she just couldn't bear it.

51:40.864 --> 51:51.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She told us all, since we were a
group of
friends, that she had been
diagnosed with

51:51.642 --> 52:01.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ovarian cancer. We were all very
shocked and
saddened by the news and later
found out that

52:01.685 --> 52:09.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ovarian cancer. We were all very
shocked and
saddened by the news and later
found out that

52:09.560 --> 52:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was, in fact, a lie, and just
a means to
keep this guy close to her.

52:16.200 --> 52:23.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the interim, the news and
the truth,
I wrote "Out to Sea," which it's
about facing

52:23.474 --> 52:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death, you know, facing your
mortality. Of
course, we have paired it with a
major key

52:31.915 --> 52:43.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an upbeat track, so it's not
as lonely
as it might seem.

52:43.594 --> 52:45.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:45.629 --> 52:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LERA LYNN: If you're trying to
get into songwriting
and you're intimidated by it,
know that everyone

52:52.803 --> 53:04.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is at first, and that you just
have to jump.

53:04.114 --> 53:09.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody ever has to hear it or
read your lyrics
or anything. You just got to
write and keep

53:09.219 --> 53:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing and let inspiration and
your own artistic
