03:07.888 --> 03:09.289
IT'S ALSO THE GOVERNMENT HAS

03:09.289 --> 03:11.158
BEEN TRYING TO PROVE THAT IT CAN

03:11.158 --> 03:12.592
CARRY OUT THIS FIGHT WITH

03:12.592 --> 03:14.227
REGULAR FORCES ON ITS OWN.

03:14.227 --> 03:19.533
>> ALL RIGHT, NOUR MALAS THANKS

03:27.641 --> 03:28.375
INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT CAUSED

03:28.375 --> 03:29.142
THAT DEADLY AMTRAK DERAILMENT

03:29.142 --> 03:29.943
TUESDAY.

03:29.943 --> 03:30.911
THE F.B.I. WAS CALLED IN TO

03:30.911 --> 03:31.778
FIGURE OUT WHETHER SOME KIND OF

03:31.778 --> 03:32.746
PROJECTILE HIT THE LEFT

03:32.746 --> 03:33.713
WINDSHIELD JUST BEFORE THE TRAIN

03:33.713 --> 03:34.514
JUMPED THE TRACKS.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.515
BUT THIS MORNING, THE HEAD OF

03:35.515 --> 03:36.550
THE N.T.S.B. SAID OFFICIALS HAVE

03:36.550 --> 03:37.451
FOUND NO RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

03:37.451 --> 03:38.418
INDICATING ANYTHING STRUCK THE

03:38.418 --> 03:39.486

03:39.486 --> 03:40.620
THE TRAIN WAS TRAVELLING 106

03:40.620 --> 03:41.555
MILES PER HOUR WHEN IT CRASHED.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.656
NOW AN AMTRAK SPOKESMAN SAYS THE

03:42.656 --> 03:43.757
COMPANY IS WORKING TO COMPLY

03:43.757 --> 03:44.791

03:56.603 --> 03:57.604
THOSE COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS FOR

03:57.604 --> 04:00.707
YEARS.

04:00.707 --> 04:01.842
>> WE HAVE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

04:01.842 --> 04:03.543

04:05.212 --> 04:07.180
SAW HAPPEN WHICH THE N.T.S.B.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.049
SAYS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED

04:09.049 --> 04:11.585
SHOULD WE HAVE HAD POSITIVE

04:11.585 --> 04:12.352
TRAIN CONTROL WE SHOULD NOT BE

04:12.352 --> 04:13.220
SCRIMPING ON INVESTMENTS IN

04:13.220 --> 04:16.323
PUBLIC SAFETY.

04:16.323 --> 04:17.791

THE OTHER.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.038
IN HAWAII, ONE OF THE WORLD'S

MOST ACTIVE VOLCANOES COULD BE

05:38.939 --> 05:40.273

05:42.309 --> 05:43.577
AS 25 QUAKES PER HOUR ON THE

THREAT TO THE POPULATION.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.589
USING HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO THEN

07:36.589 --> 07:38.024
HOLD THEM IN CAMPS IN THE JUNGLE

07:38.024 --> 07:40.060
FOR RANSOM UNTIL SOMEONE CAN PAY

07:40.060 --> 07:41.995
TO GET THEM OUT, TO PAY FOR

07:41.995 --> 07:43.763
THEIR VOYAGE.

07:43.763 --> 07:44.631
YOU KNOW THEY GO ON THESE

07:44.631 --> 07:45.432
VOYAGES, NO MONEY DOWN.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.200
THERE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED

07:47.200 --> 07:48.368
MURDERS, RAPES, TORTURES IN

07:48.368 --> 07:49.336
THESE CAMPS.

07:49.336 --> 07:53.206
WHAT THE THAI GOVERNMENTAL DID

07:53.206 --> 07:54.307
WAS -- GOVERNMENT DID WAS ARREST

07:54.307 --> 07:56.109
A MAJOR TRAFFICKER AS WELL AS

07:56.109 --> 07:58.111
THAI OFFICIALS THAT WERE

07:58.111 --> 08:02.816
IMPLICATED IN THIS.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.786
FOR THOUSANDS WAITING AT SEA OFF

08:06.786 --> 08:09.022
THE THAI COAST UNTIL IT'S SAFE

08:09.022 --> 08:10.390
TO COME INTO LAND AND COME INTO

08:10.390 --> 08:11.458
THESE CAMPS AND THEN TRANSFER

08:11.458 --> 08:12.625
ACROSS THE BEARD TO MALAYSIA.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.927
THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.195
WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW IS CHAOS ON

08:15.195 --> 08:18.598
THE SEA, YOU'VE HAD BOAT LOADS

08:18.598 --> 08:20.700
OF PEOPLE ABANDONED AND NOWHERE

08:20.700 --> 08:26.840
TO GO AND NO ONE TO TAKE THEM.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.608
>> Sreenivasan: YOU'VE BEEN

08:28.608 --> 08:30.310
FOLLOWING THIS FOR THE LAST

08:30.310 --> 08:33.213
COUPLE EVER DAYS, WHAT'S THAT

08:33.213 --> 08:34.214
BEEN LIKE?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.315
>> WE SUDDENLY GOT DESPERATE

08:35.315 --> 08:39.786
CALLS FROM THIS BOAT THAT WAS

08:39.786 --> 08:40.453
STRANDED.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.588
NORTH IN THAILAND, FLOATING OUT

08:41.588 --> 08:42.622
OF THE BORDERS IN THE AREA I AM

08:42.622 --> 08:43.623
RIGHT NOW, BEAUTIFUL RESORT

08:43.623 --> 08:44.657
ISLAND, REALLY POPULAR WITH

08:44.657 --> 08:46.359
TOURISTS.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.727
THEY WERE FLOATING AT SEA, HAVE

08:47.727 --> 08:49.396
BEEN FOUND SINCE BASICALLY

08:49.396 --> 08:50.430
KNOCKED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

08:50.430 --> 08:57.404
THE THAI AND MALAYSIAN VESSELS.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.338
TODAY, THEY WERE TOWED OUT WEST

08:58.338 --> 08:59.773
TOWARDS INDONESIA AND WE

08:59.773 --> 09:04.344
HAVEN'T HEARD MORE ABOUT THEM.

09:04.344 --> 09:11.451
>> Sreenivasan: THE THAI

09:11.451 --> 09:12.252
GOVERNMENT TOWED THIS BOAT BACK

09:12.252 --> 09:13.420
OUT TO SEA?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.521
>> THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO GO

09:14.521 --> 09:15.121
TO MALAYSIA.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.389
THE STORY IS A LITTLE MORE

09:16.389 --> 09:17.323
MURKY.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.391
THE BOATS ARE UNDER THE

09:18.391 --> 09:19.292
GOVERNMENT CONTROL, THE THAI

09:19.292 --> 09:28.168
PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THESE

09:28.168 --> 09:28.935
BOATS WANT TO GO TO WHERE THEIR

09:28.935 --> 09:30.503
BOSSES ARE, THE PEOPLE ON BOARD

09:30.503 --> 09:35.708
WANT TO LIVE.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.378
WE TOOK A SPEEDBOAT OUT, SAW

09:38.378 --> 09:39.279
THIS SAW THE THAI NAVY PULLING

09:39.279 --> 09:42.682
THEM BACK TO INDONESIA.

09:42.682 --> 09:49.489
THEY ARE INTERCEPTED BY

09:49.489 --> 09:50.757
THE MALAYSIANS, SAW THE BOAT

09:50.757 --> 09:52.025
BACK AGAIN ON THE THAI SIDE.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.294
YOU CAN SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE

09:54.294 --> 10:02.302
PING PONG TABLE.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.503
>> Sreenivasan: IN A COUPLE OF

10:03.503 --> 10:04.838
WEEKS IN THE MEANTIME WE STILL

10:04.838 --> 10:05.772
HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON

10:05.772 --> 10:06.473
THESE BOATS.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.307
>> YES.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.108
AND THESE DESPERATE SITUATIONS.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.610
WITH YOU PULL UP YOU KNOW WHEN

10:10.610 --> 10:11.811
WE PULL UP BESIDE THIS BOAT

10:11.811 --> 10:15.048
YESTERDAY, YOU CAN SEE THERE'S

10:15.048 --> 10:15.815
SERIOUS MALNUTRITION AMONGST

10:15.815 --> 10:16.983
PEOPLE ON BOARD.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.451
WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING BEFORE

10:18.451 --> 10:20.487
THE CRISIS BLEW UP AND

10:20.487 --> 10:24.023
CONDITIONS ARE EXTREMELY BAD.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.325
PEOPLE DIE REGULARLY ON THESE

10:25.325 --> 10:26.993
BOATS AND ARE DUMPED OVERBOARD

10:26.993 --> 10:28.595
BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND THEY'RE AT

10:28.595 --> 10:34.234
SEA FOR MONTHS IN MANY CASES.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.402
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE A

10:36.402 --> 10:37.337
POSSIBLE PLAN THAT THE

10:37.337 --> 10:38.137
GOVERNMENTS CAN COME UP WITH

10:38.137 --> 10:40.473
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.875
>> THEY'RE BEING URGED BY A LOT

10:41.875 --> 10:43.376
OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

10:43.376 --> 10:47.046
TO SIMPLY TAKE THESE PEOPLE IN.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.015
I DON'T KNOW AND I HAVEN'T HEARD

10:49.015 --> 10:52.919
EXACTLY WHAT ANY FORM AND

10:52.919 --> 10:54.454
AGREEMENT WOULD TAKE, I THINK

10:54.454 --> 10:58.625
THAT REALLY REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.026
>> Sreenivasan: AUBREY BELFORD

11:00.026 --> 11:02.128
FROM REUTERS, JOINING US BY

11:02.128 --> 11:11.404

11:17.176 --> 11:18.411
THE UNITED STATES IS AMONG THE

11:18.411 --> 11:19.779
WORLD'S LEADERS IN BIOMEDICAL

11:19.779 --> 11:20.813
RESEARCH, THANKS IN LARGE PART

11:20.813 --> 11:21.981
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH

11:21.981 --> 11:22.949
SUPPORTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

11:22.949 --> 11:24.050
OF SCIENTISTS WITH GRANTS.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.151
BUT FOR MORE THAN A DECADE,

11:25.151 --> 11:26.386
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR BIOMEDICAL

11:26.386 --> 11:27.854
RESEARCH HAS BEEN DECLINING.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.789
SOME SAY THE TREND THREATENS NOT

11:29.789 --> 11:31.090
ONLY THE CAREERS OF PROMISING

11:31.090 --> 11:32.592
SCIENTISTS AND AMERICA'S

11:32.592 --> 11:33.726
PREEMINENT ROLE IN SCIENCE

11:33.726 --> 11:34.928

PURSUE A CAREER IN SCIENCE HERE

11:48.141 --> 11:52.145
IN THE U.S.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.113
>> THE UNITED STATES WAS ALWAYS

11:54.113 --> 11:56.149
SEEN AS THE PLACE TO BE A

11:56.149 --> 11:57.517
SCIENTIST BECAUSE THERE WERE A

11:57.517 --> 11:59.986
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.955
>> Reporter: SO WAS IT YOUR

12:01.955 --> 12:02.722
DREAM TO, YOU KNOW, ONE DAY HAVE

12:02.722 --> 12:03.423
YOUR OWN LAB?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.924
>> OF COURSE.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.893
OF COURSE.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.428
>> Reporter: QUADRO HAS NOW BEEN

12:08.428 --> 12:09.529
RUNNING HER OWN LAB AT RUTGERS

12:09.529 --> 12:11.431
UNIVERSITY IN NEW JERSEY FOR

12:11.431 --> 12:12.832
ALMOST 10 YEARS.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.867
AND SHE'S BUILT HER CAREER ON

12:14.867 --> 12:16.135
ANSWERING A VERY SPECIFIC

12:16.135 --> 12:17.704
QUESTION: HOW VITAMIN A IS

12:17.704 --> 12:19.639
ABSORBED BY EMBRYOS AND

12:19.639 --> 12:21.441
UNDERSTANDING THAT BASIC

12:21.441 --> 12:22.275
FUNCTION COULD ULTIMATELY HELP

12:22.275 --> 12:26.512
PREVENT BIRTH DEFECTS.

12:26.512 --> 12:27.947
>> WHEN YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND

12:27.947 --> 12:29.048
OR THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE

12:29.048 --> 12:30.049
UNDERSTOOD A LITTLE TINY THING

12:30.049 --> 12:31.618
THAT IS GOING ON INTO A CELL.

12:31.618 --> 12:35.021
IT'S REALLY REWARDING.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.190
>> Reporter: BUT NOW, ALL OF HER

12:37.190 --> 12:39.225
YEARS OF WORK IS IN JEOPARDY.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.094
LIKE MANY SCIENTISTS WORKING AT

12:41.094 --> 12:42.562
A UNIVERSITY, SHE DEPENDS ON

12:42.562 --> 12:44.263
GRANTS FROM THE FEDERAL

12:44.263 --> 12:46.199
GOVERNMENT TO RUN HER LAB.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.567
THEY PAY FOR EVERYTHING FROM

12:47.567 --> 12:48.534
SUPPLIES TO HER TEAM OF

12:48.534 --> 12:49.869
RESEARCHERS.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.204
IF QUADRO DOESN'T GET A NEW

12:51.204 --> 12:52.238
GRANT BY JULY, SHE'LL BE OUT OF

12:52.238 --> 12:53.406
MONEY.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.540
SO YOU'RE IN DANGER OF LOSING

12:54.540 --> 12:55.241
YOUR LAB.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.844
>> YES.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.483
FUNDER OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IN

13:03.483 --> 13:04.951
THE WORLD.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.486
BUT OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS, THE

13:06.486 --> 13:08.287
N.I.H. BUDGET HAS ACTUALLY

13:08.287 --> 13:10.390
DECLINED MORE THAN 22% IN TERMS

13:10.390 --> 13:12.625
OF PURCHASING POWER.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.060
AND TIGHTER BUDGETS HAVE MEANT

13:14.060 --> 13:15.928
THAT GETTING ONE OF THESE

13:15.928 --> 13:17.096
COVETED GRANTS IS EVEN MORE

13:17.096 --> 13:18.264
DIFFICULT.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.499
IN THE PAST, A THIRD OF ALL

13:19.499 --> 13:21.000
GRANTS SUBMITTED WERE FUNDED.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.202
TODAY IT'S ABOUT A SIXTH OF ALL

13:23.202 --> 13:24.237
GRANTS.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.505
AND MANY SAY THIS

13:25.505 --> 13:27.206
HYPERCOMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE IS

13:27.206 --> 13:28.641
THREATENING NOT ONLY THE CAREERS

MONEY.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.953

15:33.633 --> 15:35.635
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE

15:35.635 --> 15:37.904
SCIENCE WE'RE NOT DOING TODAY,

15:37.904 --> 15:39.071
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

15:39.071 --> 15:43.342
RESOURCES, IS HURTING OUR FUTURE

15:43.342 --> 15:44.210
10, 15, 20 YEARS FROM NOW IN

15:44.210 --> 15:45.444
WAYS THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.412
>> Reporter: WHY SHOULD IT BE,

15:46.412 --> 15:47.446
YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT'S

15:47.446 --> 15:48.281
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE PRIMARY

15:48.281 --> 15:49.282
FUNDER FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.251
WHY NOT FOUNDATIONS OR PRIVATE

15:52.251 --> 15:53.219
INDUSTRY?

15:53.219 --> 15:54.387
>> PRIVATE INDUSTRY, FRANKLY, IS

15:54.387 --> 15:56.489
NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.325
THEIR STOCKHOLDERS ARE EXPECTING

15:59.325 --> 16:00.593
A RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT, AND

16:00.593 --> 16:01.994
INCREASINGLY EXPECTING THAT

16:01.994 --> 16:04.130
RETURN TO HAPPEN QUICKLY IN A

16:04.130 --> 16:07.300
MATTER OF A COUPLE OF YEARS.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.534
>> Reporter: AND DR. COLLINS

16:08.534 --> 16:09.502
SAYS THAT PHILANTHROPY FUNDS

16:09.502 --> 16:11.003
ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF RESEARCH

16:11.003 --> 16:12.038
COMPARED TO THE N.I.H. AND OFTEN

16:12.038 --> 16:13.406
HAS A NARROW FOCUS ON SPECIFIC

16:13.406 --> 16:15.308
DISEASES.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.210
>> HE LEFT ACADEMIA.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.744

16:18.744 --> 16:19.679
COLLEAGUE OF LOREDANA QUADRO'S

16:19.679 --> 16:20.780
AT RUTGERS.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.682
SHE'S BEEN A SCIENTIST FOR MORE

16:22.682 --> 16:25.017
THAN THREE DECADES AND HAS SEEN

16:25.017 --> 16:26.953
THE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE

16:26.953 --> 16:28.321
COMPETITION FOR SCIENCE FUNDING

16:28.321 --> 16:30.456
OVER THE YEARS.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.558
ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T BEEN EASY,

16:32.558 --> 16:33.326
SHE'S BEEN CONSISTENTLY FUNDED

16:33.326 --> 16:34.260
DURING HER CAREER.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.294
SHE SAYS HAVING YEARS OF

16:35.294 --> 16:36.395
EXPERIENCE CAN GIVE SENIOR

16:36.395 --> 16:37.697
SCIENTISTS LIKE HER A LEG UP.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.332
>> PART OF THE REASON I THINK

16:39.332 --> 16:41.067
IT'S EASIER FOR A SENIOR

16:41.067 --> 16:43.102
INVESTIGATOR TO GET FUNDED THAN

16:43.102 --> 16:44.103
A JUNIOR INVESTIGATOR IS BECAUSE

16:44.103 --> 16:45.638
WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.839
>> Reporter: AND SOME IN THE

16:46.839 --> 16:47.940
NEXT GENERATION HAVE DECIDED TO

16:47.940 --> 16:50.243
DROP OUT ALTOGETHER.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.777
>> WE HAVE GRADUATE STUDENTS

16:51.777 --> 16:53.279
THAT DECIDE NOT TO FINISH, WE

16:53.279 --> 16:55.414
HAVE GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO

16:55.414 --> 16:56.682
FINISH AND THEN GO AND DO

16:56.682 --> 16:58.484
SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.652
BUT PEOPLE ARE OPTING OUT LIKE

16:59.652 --> 17:03.189
CRAZY.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.390

17:04.390 --> 17:05.157
WASSEF-BIROSIK.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.726
SHE WAS QUADRO'S FIRST

17:06.726 --> 17:08.127
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AND CAME TO

17:08.127 --> 17:11.597
THE U.S. FROM AUSTRALIA IN 2006.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.132
BUT AFTER SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS

17:13.132 --> 17:14.734
IN QUADRO'S LAB, SHE DECIDED TO

17:14.734 --> 17:16.168
SWITCH CAREERS.

17:16.168 --> 17:17.470
SHE'S NOW WORKING AS A MEDICAL

17:17.470 --> 17:19.405
WRITER.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.540
>> Reporter: I MEAN, THAT'S A

17:21.540 --> 17:22.308
BIG DECISION, TO CHANGE COURSE

17:22.308 --> 17:22.975
LIKE THAT?

17:22.975 --> 17:23.643
>> YEAH.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.212
IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.380
I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.347
BUT I WAS VERY NAIVE.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.816
I DIDN'T SEE HOW HARD IT WAS TO

17:30.816 --> 17:33.352
GET A GRANT.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.322
AND NO MATTER WHO YOU SPOKE TO,

17:36.322 --> 17:38.291
NO MATTER WHICH LAB YOU SPOKE

17:38.291 --> 17:39.759
TO, EVERYONE WOULD SAY, "IT WAS

17:39.759 --> 17:43.529
TOUGH."

17:43.529 --> 17:45.197
>> WHAT WAKES ME UP AT NIGHT IS

17:45.197 --> 17:49.502
THIS NEXT GENERATION AND WHAT'S

17:49.502 --> 17:50.269
HAPPENING TO THEM.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.337
AND THEY'RE INVARIABLY EXCITED

17:51.337 --> 17:52.705
ABOUT THE SCIENCE THAT THEY'RE

17:52.705 --> 17:53.906
DOING, BUT INVARIABLY ANXIOUS

17:53.906 --> 17:55.174
ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A FUTURE.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.542
>> Reporter: THE ENVIRONMENT FOR

17:56.542 --> 17:57.710
SCIENCE FUNDING HAS LEFT SOME

17:57.710 --> 17:59.045
QUESTIONING WHETHER THE UNITED

17:59.045 --> 18:00.746
STATES WILL REMAIN THE SAME

18:00.746 --> 18:02.114
WORLDWIDE LEADER IN SCIENCE

18:02.114 --> 18:03.549
RESEARCH THAT ATTRACTED LOREDANA

18:03.549 --> 18:05.251
QUADRO AND SO MANY OTHERS HERE.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.391
CONSIDERING LEAVING THE COUNTRY

18:12.391 --> 18:13.626
TO PURSUE THEIR CAREERS.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.427
>> WE ARE STILL THE LEADER, BUT

18:14.427 --> 18:16.028
NOT BY A LOT.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.063
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT POINT TO

18:17.063 --> 18:18.564
CHINA IN PARTICULAR.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.433
IN ANOTHER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS,

18:20.433 --> 18:21.701
THEY WILL BE SPENDING MORE IN

18:21.701 --> 18:24.236
ABSOLUTE DOLLARS THAN WE ARE.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.471
AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE ALREADY

18:25.471 --> 18:26.839
APPARENT.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.240
CHINA FILED MORE PATENTS IN

18:28.240 --> 18:29.608
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH LAST YEAR

18:29.608 --> 18:32.044
THAN THE UNITED STATES DID.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.546

HAVE LOTS OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE

18:40.920 --> 18:42.321
CONSEQUENCES.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.456
RESEARCH THAT GOES ON IN THE

18:43.456 --> 18:45.558
U.S. HAS THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD

18:45.558 --> 18:47.026
OF INFLUENCING OUR MEDICAL CARE

18:47.026 --> 18:48.995
IN THE SHORT RUN.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.262
IT ALSO IS THE COUNTRY THAT'S

18:50.262 --> 18:51.430

AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

19:08.414 --> 19:11.484
GENOME RESEARCH.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.152
TO HELP SCIENTISTS WITH FUNDING,

19:13.152 --> 19:15.354
THE N.I.H. IS EXPERIMENTING WITH

19:15.354 --> 19:16.622
DIFFERENT MODELS OF FUNDING,

19:16.622 --> 19:19.358
GRANTS SPECIFICALLY GEARED

19:19.358 --> 19:21.293
TOWARDS YOUNGER SCIENTISTS AND

19:21.293 --> 19:22.862
ALLOWING INVESTIGATORS TO RE-

19:22.862 --> 19:24.030
SUBMIT GRANTS MULTIPLE TIMES.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.197
BUT FOR LOREDANA QUADRO, TIME IS

19:25.197 --> 19:26.565
RUNNING OUT.

19:26.565 --> 19:27.867
SHE HAS RECEIVED SOME BRIDGE

19:27.867 --> 19:28.934

19:28.934 --> 19:31.137
CONTINUES TO WORK ON GRANTS,

19:31.137 --> 19:35.307
INCLUDING TO THE N.I.H.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.876
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER LEAVING

19:36.876 --> 19:39.478
THIS FIELD?

19:39.478 --> 19:41.614

19:42.081 --> 19:43.215
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET FUNDED

19:43.215 --> 19:45.051
FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU ARE

19:45.051 --> 19:46.952
AUTOMATICALLY OUT OF THE

19:46.952 --> 19:48.554
PICTURE.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.357
IT WOULD BE VERY TOUGH TO GO

19:51.357 --> 19:53.392
BACK IN.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.361
AND IF THIS HAPPENS, I WILL HAVE

19:55.361 --> 20:00.533
TO MAKE A DECISION.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.801

BOSSES.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.784
MORE AND MORE COMPANIES ARE

20:19.785 --> 20:20.820
TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK EMPLOYEES,

20:20.820 --> 20:22.354
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE OFF THE CLOCK.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.356
ONE WORKER WHO TURNED OFF THE

20:24.356 --> 20:26.125
G.P.S. TRACKER IN HER PHONE GOT

20:26.125 --> 20:27.259
FIRED.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.194

20:32.765 --> 20:36.502
THIS FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.203
BRIAN FUNG, MANY REPORTERS

20:37.203 --> 20:38.304
FOLLOWING THIS STORY.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.038
FIRST OF ALL GET SOME OF US UP

20:39.038 --> 20:39.939
TO SPEED.

20:39.939 --> 20:40.840
WHAT'S HAPPENED, WHAT IS THE

20:40.840 --> 20:41.841
COMPANY WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHY

20:41.841 --> 20:45.144
SHE'S SUING?

20:45.144 --> 20:53.352
>> THE COMPANY THAT'S INVOLVED

20:53.352 --> 20:53.986
IS INTERMEX, WIRE TRANSFER

20:53.986 --> 20:54.687
SERVICES.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.521
THE WOMAN INVOLVED HER NAME IS

20:55.521 --> 20:56.922
MYRNA ARIAS.

20:56.922 --> 20:57.923
SHE'S SUING HER EMPLOYER BECAUSE

20:57.923 --> 21:01.227
HER EMPLOYER INSTALLED A TYPE OF

21:01.227 --> 21:04.330
SOFTWARE ON HER PHONE THAT WILL

21:04.330 --> 21:05.297
ALLEGEDLY TRACK HER EVEN WHEN

21:05.297 --> 21:09.368
SHE'S NOT ON THE CLOCK.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.837
SO THE EMPLOYEE HERE ARIAS SAID

21:11.837 --> 21:16.642
THIS WAS AN INVASION OF HER

21:16.642 --> 21:18.177
PRIVACY AND SHE DELETED THE APP

21:18.177 --> 21:19.011
AND HER EMPLOYER DECIDED TO FIRE

21:19.011 --> 21:22.348
HER.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.449
IT'S A MATTER FOR THE COURTS TO

21:23.449 --> 21:27.019
DECIDE WHO'S RIGHT HERE.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.722
>> Sreenivasan: THE IDEA OF

21:29.722 --> 21:30.656
TRACKING ISN'T NECESSARILY NEW.

21:30.656 --> 21:31.490
GPS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG

21:31.490 --> 21:32.258
TIME.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.092
SMARTPHONES AND APPS HAVE BEEN

21:33.092 --> 21:34.293
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.529
WHY IS THIS PIERCING OUR

21:36.529 --> 21:38.831
INTEREST BUBBLE RIGHT NOW?

21:38.831 --> 21:39.999
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.433
WE HAVE HAD THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR

21:41.433 --> 21:43.369
A LONG TIME.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.070
EMPLOYERS HAVE LONG TRACKED

21:45.070 --> 21:46.205
PEOPLE THROUGH GPS IN THEIR

21:46.205 --> 21:47.973
CARS.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.341
NOW THAT WE HAVE SMARTPHONES

21:49.341 --> 21:51.043
EVERYWHERE AND THEY ARE SO

21:51.043 --> 21:55.814
UBIQUITOUS, IT IS SO EASY TO

21:55.814 --> 22:01.787
TRACK PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR CELL

22:01.787 --> 22:05.858
PHONES THAN IN THEIR VEHICLES,

22:05.858 --> 22:06.892
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS AN

22:06.892 --> 22:07.826
EXPANSION OF

22:07.826 --> 22:09.295
RACK TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK

22:09.295 --> 22:10.062
SOME PEOPLE ARE REACTING AGAINST

22:10.062 --> 22:13.432
THAT.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.301
>> Sreenivasan: THERE IS ALSO

22:15.301 --> 22:16.769
THIS BALANCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE

22:16.769 --> 22:18.704
USE CASES VERSUS CIVIL RIGHTS

22:18.704 --> 22:19.638
ABUSES RIGHT?

22:19.638 --> 22:20.573
IF I'M GOING TO A SPECIFIC KIND

22:20.573 --> 22:21.407
OF DOCTOR AND YOU KNOW THE

22:21.407 --> 22:22.441
LOCATION OF THAT DURING THE

22:22.441 --> 22:26.679
LUNCH TIME AND WEEKENDS, THAT

22:26.679 --> 22:27.513
MIGHT BE A VIOLATION OF MY

22:27.513 --> 22:35.821
PRIVACY.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.223
BUT A UPS OR FEDEX EMPLOYEE,

22:37.223 --> 22:38.123
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE MAKING

22:38.123 --> 22:38.891
THEIR DELIVERIES AS FAST AS THEY

22:38.891 --> 22:39.592
CAN.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.759
>> THAT'S WHY EMPLOYERS HAVE

22:40.759 --> 22:41.760
RACED TO ADOPT THIS TECHNOLOGY,

22:41.760 --> 22:42.861
IN PART, TO SEE THAT EMPLOYEES

22:42.861 --> 22:43.662
ARE WORKING RESPONSIBLY AND

22:43.662 --> 22:44.597
RELIABLY.

22:44.597 --> 22:48.167
BUT MAKING SURE THAT EMPLOYEES

22:48.167 --> 22:52.638
TAKE THEIR MANDATORY WORK

22:52.638 --> 22:55.140
BREAKS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

22:55.140 --> 22:57.910
CERTAIN STATE LAWS.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.345
SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

22:59.345 --> 23:06.218
ONE REASON WHY COMPANIES WOULD

23:06.218 --> 23:06.986
BE EAGER TO USE THIS KIND OF

23:06.986 --> 23:07.820
TECHNOLOGY.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.787
ALSO, IT COMES WITH PITFALLS,

23:08.787 --> 23:09.488
WHEN COMPANIES ARE TRACKING

23:09.488 --> 23:10.322
THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY'RE NOT

23:10.322 --> 23:11.223
WORKING.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.091
AS YOU SAID, THERE'S A LOT OF

23:12.091 --> 23:14.093
CONCERN ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

23:14.093 --> 23:15.561
INFORMATION YOU COULD GLEAN FROM

23:15.561 --> 23:18.364
A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR JUST BY LOOK

23:18.364 --> 23:22.868
AT THEIR LOCATION TRAFFIC.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.103
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE A TIME

23:24.103 --> 23:25.404
ANYWHERE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY

23:25.404 --> 23:27.006
OFF THE CLOCK, JUST BECAUSE WE

23:27.006 --> 23:28.641
HAVE THESE E-MAIL LEASHES BUT

23:28.641 --> 23:29.575
OUR COMPANY FINDS US ANYWHERE WE

23:29.575 --> 23:37.016
ARE.

23:37.016 --> 23:43.222
>> A WAY TO LOOK AT

23:43.222 --> 23:44.189
THIS, EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE

23:44.189 --> 23:45.291
INSTITUTED HARD BANS ON E-MAIL

23:45.291 --> 23:46.058
AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD AFTER

23:46.058 --> 23:46.892
YOUR WORKDAY IS OVER.

23:46.892 --> 23:47.826
AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF

23:47.826 --> 23:49.061
COURSE E-MAIL CAN FIND YOU NO

23:49.061 --> 23:49.962
MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, OR WHAT

23:49.962 --> 23:50.829
TIME OF DAY IT IS.

23:50.829 --> 23:51.830
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT CULTURE.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.332
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS

23:53.332 --> 23:54.700
CERTAINLY A LOT OF CONSTERNATION

23:54.700 --> 23:56.735
ABOUT BEING AVAILABLE ALL THE

23:56.735 --> 23:57.770
TIME.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.805
PARTICULARLY, YOU KNOW, AS MORE

23:59.805 --> 24:00.906
AND MORE PEOPLE START ADOPTING

24:00.906 --> 24:02.474
SMARTPHONES AND BEING ON MEDIA

24:02.474 --> 24:06.045
24-7.

24:06.045 --> 24:06.679
>> Sreenivasan: BRIAN FUNG

24:06.679 --> 24:07.413
THANKS SO MUCH FOR

24:07.413 --> 24:11.417
JOINING US.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.651
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

24:12.651 --> 24:15.154
SUNDAY.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.259

24:20.259 --> 24:21.960
ON THE NEWSHOUR: HEAD START AT

24:21.960 --> 24:23.195
50.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.963
>> IN 1965 I WAS SITTING ON

24:24.963 --> 24:27.232
THE PORCH OF OUR LITTLE SHOTGUN

24:27.232 --> 24:30.169
SHACK IN AMES, TEXAS, AND THE

24:30.169 --> 24:33.339
WOMAN APPROACHED THE HOUSE.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.940
SHE INTRODUCED HERSELF AND TOLD

24:34.940 --> 24:36.709
MY MOTHER THAT SHE WAS

24:36.709 --> 24:38.510
REPRESENTING A NEW PROGRAM

24:38.510 --> 24:40.546
CALLED HEAD START.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.147
>> HIS MOTHER SIGNED HIM UP IN

24:42.147 --> 24:44.249
THE PROGRAM'S INAUGURAL YEAR.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.617
>> IT ALLOWED ME TO THINK ABOUT

24:45.617 --> 24:47.953
THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF MY

24:47.953 --> 24:49.822
ENVIRONMENT.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.723
>> Sreenivasan: THAT'S TOMORROW

24:50.723 --> 24:51.256
ON THE NEWSHOUR.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.524
