JUDY WOODRUFF: From
President Trump today,
an abrupt announcement.

00:03.733 --> 00:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is reinstating a ban
on transgender troops,
and reopening the debate
on who gets to serve

00:10.366 --> 00:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the U.S. military.

00:12.433 --> 00:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Word of the military policy
reversal came not from the
Pentagon, but from the president

00:18.900 --> 00:21.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Twitter.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "The United States
government will not accept or
allow transgender individuals

00:26.333 --> 00:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to serve in any capacity
in the U.S. military."

00:30.066 --> 00:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he went on: "Our military
must be focused on victory,
and cannot be burdened with the

00:37.100 --> 00:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tremendous medical costs and
disruption that transgender
in the military would entail."

00:42.733 --> 00:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidate Trump had promised
to protect the rights
of transgender people.

00:46.733 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House Press Secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders was
asked about that today.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, INCOMING
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:
He's also voiced that this

00:52.733 --> 00:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a very expensive and
disruptive policy, and based on
consultation that he's had with

00:59.366 --> 01:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his national security team, came
to the conclusion that it erodes
military readiness and unit

01:03.566 --> 01:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cohesion, and made the
decision based on that.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Socially
conservative groups
welcomed the decision, but
it drew quick condemnation

01:13.466 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from many Democrats,
including New York Congressman
Sean Patrick Maloney.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY (D), New
York: We have heard every tired
-- every tired discriminatory

01:20.166 --> 01:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument before, and they have
always fallen away over time in
the face of reason and decency

01:26.233 --> 01:28.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and equality.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some leading
members of the president's own
party also rejected the new

01:32.233 --> 01:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ban, including Senators John
McCain and Orrin Hatch and Joni
Ernst, who served in the U.S.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military in Iraq.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, Former
U.S. Secretary Of Defense:
I'm announcing today
that we're ending the

01:43.166 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ban on transgender Americans
in the United States military.

01:46.100 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this
comes more than a year after the
Obama administration's secretary

01:53.000 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defense, Ashton Carter,
announced that transgender
people would be allowed to serve

01:56.933 --> 01:59.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
openly.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The RAND Cooperation
estimates there are up
to 6,600 transgender
troops on active duty,

02:05.066 --> 02:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with possibly another
4,000 in the Reserves.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carter gave the armed services
until this month to adjust.

02:12.300 --> 02:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his successor, James Mattis,
recently delayed implementation
by another six months.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Joint Chiefs of Staff said
they need to determine whether
transgender recruits have

02:25.533 --> 02:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical issues affecting
their ability to deploy and
meet physical standards.

02:31.166 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congresswoman
Vicky Hartzler of Missouri
has unsuccessfully
proposed legislation

02:36.533 --> 02:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bar medical services
for transgender troops.

02:38.766 --> 02:40.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:40.866 --> 02:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICKY HARTZLER (R), Missouri:
The bottom line is, do we need
to spend any of our precious

02:42.900 --> 02:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax dollars on these surgeries,
when we have soldiers that are
having trouble getting body

02:48.633 --> 02:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
armor and bullets?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brynn
Tannehill is a transgender
former Navy pilot, and
director for an advocacy

02:56.300 --> 02:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group that fights for
transgender service members.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CMDR.

03:01.566 --> 03:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYNN TANNEHILL (RET.)
ÑMD-BOÑU.S. Navy:
What's extraordinarily
disruptive to unit

03:03.600 --> 03:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cohesion is taking people who
have unique, valuable skills
within their units, and yanking

03:08.100 --> 03:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them out of those units,
ones that are often only
one deep in their units.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you can't replace that.

03:12.766 --> 03:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what affects mission
and mission accomplishment.

03:15.466 --> 03:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White
House indicated today
that the military will
take the lead on deciding

03:21.866 --> 03:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what becomes of transgender
people already serving.

03:25.133 --> 03:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our own William Brangham has
reported on transgender people
serving in the military.

03:29.566 --> 03:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He joins me now to
further explain today's
move by the president.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, William, first,
something about the term.

03:35.266 --> 03:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are talking about
people who are transgender.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The term transition or
transitioning is also used.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Help us understand
the distinction.

03:43.666 --> 03:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
this can be confusing
for a lot of people.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just basic facts.

03:48.100 --> 03:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To be transgender just
means that your gender
identity doesn't match
your birth certificate.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you're born as female, but
you do not feel you're female.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You feel like you're a male.

03:57.433 --> 04:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To transition can mean a
whole spectrum of things.

04:00.866 --> 04:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can mean -- it's not just
the surgery people tend to think
of, and certainly not every

04:04.900 --> 04:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transgender person
has that surgery.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It can simply mean
taking hormones.

04:09.033 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It can just mean changing your
clothes, changing your name.

04:12.533 --> 04:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, transitioning can be an
entire spectrum from things,
from medical technologies to

04:17.333 --> 04:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just changing your
personality a little.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we heard
the president - - the press
secretary at the White House,

04:22.433 --> 04:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sarah Sanders, citing the
president's concerns, and
he tweeted about this.

04:26.333 --> 04:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says it's expensive,
the cost, the disruption.

04:30.266 --> 04:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She talked about
readiness, unit cohesion.

04:33.366 --> 04:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are those factors that the
Pentagon is concerned about?

04:36.600 --> 04:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As far as we
know, there's no good evidence
that the Pentagon has ever

04:40.766 --> 04:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been concerned about
those two things.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the issue of disruption,
the RAND study that you cited
in your report, they did a

04:47.066 --> 04:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study that looked at whether or
not having trans service members
would cause this disruption.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they surveyed 18 different
countries around the world,
including the U.K., Australia,

04:59.300 --> 05:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Israel, all of whom have
trans service members,
and those countries
reported no disruptions

05:03.833 --> 05:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whatsoever, no need to
change their policies.

05:06.333 --> 05:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the issue of cost,
the president said
this is -- I think he's
implying that somehow this

05:10.900 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is going to cost a
fortune for the budget.

05:13.100 --> 05:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, this RAND study
indicated that the rough costs
per year are about $2 million

05:18.833 --> 05:20.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to $8 million.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not a lot in a $600
billion Pentagon budget.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And just for point of
comparison, let's say
those RAND numbers are
totally wrong and it's

05:26.200 --> 05:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even more.

05:28.233 --> 05:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon right now spends
10 times that amount on Cialis
and Viagra, so just as a

05:34.266 --> 05:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point of comparison.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another
kind of medication.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William, why is
this happening now?

05:40.966 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a sense out of the
blue the president tweeted
about this, this morning?

05:44.633 --> 05:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It did
seem to come out of the blue.

05:46.533 --> 05:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In fact, we reached out
to the Pentagon today
to ask them about that.

05:49.333 --> 05:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an indication of how much
they were caught flat-footed
about this, they had nothing to

05:53.700 --> 05:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say and referred us
back to the White House.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My sense is that
there's two reasons.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, ever since the Obama
administration introduced
this change, there have
been social conservatives,

06:04.833 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike Pence in particular, who
have been very resistant to it.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They think it's social
engineering of the worst kind.

06:09.733 --> 06:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
vice president.

06:10.733 --> 06:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exactly.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have fought it.

06:13.766 --> 06:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, very specifically,
there was a fight in the
House amongst the GOP -- they

06:20.133 --> 06:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were trying to getting
a spending bill passed
with all sorts of goodies
that the president

06:21.333 --> 06:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wanted, including money
for his border wall.

06:24.500 --> 06:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some deficit and defense
hawks said we need to put in a
piece of legislation that bans

06:30.600 --> 06:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transgender sex
reassignment surgery.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was pushed back
on by the leadership.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, apparently, some of these
members went to the president
and said, help us out with

06:38.533 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this policy.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he then went 10, 50 yards
further down the line and
announced this outright ban.

06:46.933 --> 06:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again,
we see divisions inside the
Republican Party over this.

06:49.866 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exactly.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
William, what does this mean
for active-duty members now

06:54.400 --> 06:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are transgender,
whether they're serving in
this country or overseas?

06:57.433 --> 06:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
the great unknown.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said,
we're working out the policy.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Pentagon has
no comment on this.

07:04.266 --> 07:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to some people today
who are in touch with trans
service members right now, and

07:11.200 --> 07:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said that there is an
incredible feeling of fear and
panic and just uncertainty, that

07:15.100 --> 07:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have signed up.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You might be deployed
overseas right now.

07:18.433 --> 07:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of a sudden, you look at
your phone, the president has
tweeted that your position in

07:21.600 --> 07:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the military is over, so
big unanswered questions.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number
of questions here.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham, we thank you.
