00:01.666 --> 00:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But,
first, the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:06.366 --> 00:07.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's good.

00:07.600 --> 00:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It looks like you're
paying attention.

00:08.366 --> 00:09.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:09.366 --> 00:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Hari.

00:10.366 --> 00:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's start
with health care.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This week, we started
with repeal and replace.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it went to
repeal now, replace later.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Neither of those seem
to be going anywhere.

00:20.933 --> 00:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The
Republicans' health care
plan had three problems.

00:27.366 --> 00:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't healthy, it wasn't
caring, and there was no plan.

00:29.866 --> 00:31.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:31.100 --> 00:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It was
just that simple.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can't get
people to vote for something
when they don't know,
A, what it is, there's

00:35.666 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no public case for it, but,
beyond that, it just -- the
conservatives, led by Rand Paul,

00:42.133 --> 00:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objected that it didn't root
out and repeal Obamacare.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was correct.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the moderates, embodied by
Susan Collins, who we just saw
in the previous piece, objected

00:53.366 --> 00:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was going to hurt,
unnecessarily and gratuitously,
millions of Americans who are

00:57.633 --> 00:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needy and depend on Medicaid.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
True.

01:00.466 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the two were
almost irreconcilable.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they can't figure
out now how to leave the
field without embarrassment.

01:10.466 --> 01:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ideally, if you're a Republican,
you do not want to vote on this.

01:14.033 --> 01:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You do not want to vote
Tuesday, because it's going
to be used against you.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is incredibly unpopular.

01:19.033 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's got 16 percent
support in the country.

01:21.566 --> 01:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not one person
of the 213 in Republican
- - in the House of
Representatives voted against

01:27.733 --> 01:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it who regrets having
voted against it.

01:30.466 --> 01:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are scores of House
members in the 217 who voted
for it who are nervous that

01:36.200 --> 01:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they voted for it.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's where it is.

01:38.233 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I
don't think it's dead.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, from what I hear,
they're leaning on Mike Lee,
the senator who has been a no

01:44.466 --> 01:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote who is the decisive no
vote, to change his mind, to
buy him out with something and

01:48.900 --> 01:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer him something.

01:50.933 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they figure, once they
get him on board, there are
probably another Republican

01:53.133 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 senators who would like to
vote no, but they don't want
to be the one person who kills

01:56.966 --> 01:59.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the feeling, if you
can get Mike Lee, you can
get some of the others.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they might pass it.

02:03.133 --> 02:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wouldn't say it's likely,
but I think -- I just think
it's too early to say it's dead

02:06.000 --> 02:07.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

02:07.700 --> 02:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The second thing to say
is, Mitch McConnell has
two parts of his job.

02:12.133 --> 02:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one is to create a
process where reasonable
legislation gets promoted.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the second is to whip
for that legislation.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he did an abysmal
job on one job and a
pretty good job on job two.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As Mark said, you have got a
plan with 16 percent approval.

02:27.933 --> 02:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody in the Senate likes
it, including the Republicans.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They all hate having
to vote for it.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he still got 48 votes.

02:34.233 --> 02:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's kind of impressive.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the underlying problem
is, you have a chance to
change, to reform health care.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of conservative
ideas to reform health care.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it would solve
some problems.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could pick some things that
a lot of people would like.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could have catastrophic
coverage for the 20-odd million
people that are still uninsured

02:51.000 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after Obamacare.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could do a lot of -- offer a
lot of things to a lot of people
and do it in a conservative

02:56.000 --> 02:57.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's not what this
Republican Party does.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just say, we
want to cut Medicaid.

03:01.466 --> 03:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're unwilling to
talk about anything positive,
though there are some things in

03:05.100 --> 03:06.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bill.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just, what can
we take away from you?

03:08.366 --> 03:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what can we take away
from the poor and the
needy and the children?

03:10.700 --> 03:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a publicity and
a substantive disaster
area that they're just
trying to live with.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
the president's role in this?

03:17.533 --> 03:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The president's
role in it is mercurial.

03:21.033 --> 03:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said let Obama
founder and burn.

03:25.033 --> 03:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the next day,
he says no, within 24
hours to the Republican
senators, you have got to

03:29.200 --> 03:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come up with a plan.

03:31.033 --> 03:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He knows nothing
about the specifics.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He knows nothing
about the substance.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's made no public case for it.

03:36.533 --> 03:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't -- I think David
makes a very compelling point.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just say this, that
Mitch McConnell had a reputation
as this master strategist.

03:48.433 --> 03:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Mitch McConnell's
greatest accomplishment
as leader has been is
that he denied a hearing

03:54.266 --> 03:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to one of the sixth
most qualified nominees
to the Supreme Court
in the last century.

03:58.033 --> 04:00.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a big difference between
obstruction and construction and
putting together a coalition.

04:03.566 --> 04:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a lot easier to get
people to vote against something
than it is to vote for something

04:07.533 --> 04:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to take a chance.

04:09.566 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you're denied the
individual mandate, that is you
let healthy young people not pay

04:16.433 --> 04:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything, you leave as a
pool of people for insurance
who are older and sicker.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Therefore, it's going
to be more expensive.

04:24.666 --> 04:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you know, this isn't
rocket scientists, in spite of
the president saying it's a lot

04:28.533 --> 04:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more complicated than it is.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought
something important
happened with the
Republican views with the

04:32.933 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were having all these
meetings in the White House.

04:36.433 --> 04:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, apparently, they'd have
these substantive meetings with
Mike Pence or with somebody

04:40.466 --> 04:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else, with staff.

04:41.666 --> 04:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they would talk
through things.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They would try to
make some progress.

04:45.033 --> 04:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the president would
dip in and do something, say
something extremely stupid,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
extremely ill-informed.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they would all
groan and live through it
and wish he would leave.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then he would go.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that could be a
change in psychology.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody in the Senate has
problems with the president.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you begin to have, oh,
he's just the crazy uncle,
like an attitude of contempt,

05:08.166 --> 05:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then relationships between
the Republicans on the Hill
and the White House really do

05:10.866 --> 05:12.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
begin to change.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not some guy, oh, he
has some political magic.

05:14.233 --> 05:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's some guy who really just
is annoying and gets in the way.

05:17.433 --> 05:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
about the interview that he gave
to, some people would call it

05:20.433 --> 05:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the paper of record, and
the President Trump calls it
the failing New York Times.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this conversation, which is
worth reading in its entirety,
it's just fascinating, he

05:30.900 --> 05:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lashes out at lots
of his supporters.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He undermines his
own attorney general.

05:35.333 --> 05:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He goes after almost a
broadside to Robert Mueller.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talks about
blackmail and Comey.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you glean out of that?

05:42.833 --> 05:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First, our
subscription levels have been
way up since the Trump era.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of our journalists
tweeted out, we even
fail at failing.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's how bad we are.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:51.333 --> 05:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And there
are a couple things to
say about the interview.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, I was shocked by the
lack of just articulateness.

05:57.833 --> 06:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all hate it when we read
a transcript of ourselves.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's always embarrassing,
but not that embarrassing.

06:03.566 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These really are random --
they're not even thoughts.

06:06.633 --> 06:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're just little word
patterns, one following
another, about Napoleon,
about this and that.

06:11.233 --> 06:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a disturbing level
of incoherent thinking.

06:15.066 --> 06:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, it is -- you know,
people who work for the White
House work for the guy 16, 20

06:19.900 --> 06:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hours a day, And
Jeff Sessions in the
administration among them,
and to dump over everybody.

06:27.266 --> 06:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what is interesting
to me psychologically,
usually, when someone
is corrupt or -- they

06:31.300 --> 06:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are clever.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They try to dissemble.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They mask their corruption with
some attempt to be dishonest.

06:40.966 --> 06:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, give him credit,
he's completely transparent.

06:43.700 --> 06:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He basically said in that
interview, my corruption can
be found in my tax returns.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look into my tax
returns, I will fire you.

06:51.433 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He transmits everything that
he's thinking out in public
in an incredibly transparent

06:57.133 --> 06:59.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're looking at a fact
where Bob Mueller will
probably go to the tax returns.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump will
probably fire Bob Mueller.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we will be in some
sort of constitutional crisis.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's all telegraphed
right there out in the open.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I
was amazed by it.

07:11.333 --> 07:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, first of all, I guess
just on a personal level, this
is a man for whom there is no

07:17.533 --> 07:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty, no sense of
loyalty in anybody.

07:19.700 --> 07:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Jeff Sessions, whatever
one thinks of him, was a
Republican senator from Alabama,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first senator in the
country to endorse Donald
Trump, and a strong supporter.

07:29.033 --> 07:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as attorney general, all
Donald Trump cares about, is
Jeff Sessions going to protect

07:37.233 --> 07:38.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me?

07:38.600 --> 07:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it shows I think
a couple things.

07:41.033 --> 07:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It shows the obsession he has
with the Russian investigation.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no two ways about it.

07:47.666 --> 07:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, again, he recycles
these baseless charges about
Jim Comey, that he perjured

07:54.533 --> 07:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself in testimony before the
Senate Intelligence Committee,
which he didn't, that he leaked

08:00.900 --> 08:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidential information,
which he didn't.

08:03.433 --> 08:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but there's absolutely
no sense of loyalty that he
has to anyone else, Donald

08:10.300 --> 08:12.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just find that -- you
know, we talk about, is there
smoke there or whatever?

08:15.633 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His obsession with the
Russian investigation,
now he's back blaming
Rod Rosenstein for firing

08:22.133 --> 08:24.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he went on Lester Holt
on NBC News and took credit
for it, said, didn't make any

08:26.533 --> 08:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difference what Sessions
and Rosenstein recommended.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was going to fire him anyway.

08:31.666 --> 08:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm just -- there's
no coherence to the man,
but there's an obsession.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, let's
talk a little bit about somebody
who has been loyal to the

08:39.866 --> 08:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president, Sean Spice,
who stepped down today.

08:42.433 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He resigned over the
announcement that Anthony
Scaramucci was going to
be named communications

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scaramucci played it down.

08:49.633 --> 08:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He and Spicer and I think Reince
Priebus were all scheduled to
go on FOX tonight in a sort

08:54.733 --> 08:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of unified show, right?

08:57.100 --> 08:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what do you make of it?

08:59.200 --> 09:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I mean,
Sean Spicer, prior to going to
work at the White House, those

09:05.966 --> 09:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us who had dealt with him
over the years, he was likable,
he was helpful, he was a loyal

09:09.100 --> 09:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican, but
a square shooter.

09:11.166 --> 09:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as he made the bargain
to go to work for Donald Trump,
you know, I don't know if

09:17.800 --> 09:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he sold his soul, but
he sold part certainly
of his self-respect.

09:21.800 --> 09:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The very first thing Trump
demanded that he do was to go
out and lie about the size of

09:26.633 --> 09:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the crowd on inauguration.

09:29.266 --> 09:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Sean Spicer did it.

09:31.933 --> 09:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he lied about the
orders that Barack Obama
had, in fact, bugged,
wiretapped, President

09:39.966 --> 09:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama had, the headquarters
of Donald Trump's building.

09:46.900 --> 09:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it was that three
million undocumented immigrants
had voted on Election Day, and

09:53.366 --> 09:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's why Donald Trump --
I mean, so, it was tragic to
watch this erosion of his own

10:00.933 --> 10:02.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integrity.

10:02.166 --> 10:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's not a bad guy
or anything of sort.

10:06.366 --> 10:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But everybody, I can honestly
say, with rare exception, who
has been associated with this

10:12.900 --> 10:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
administration and
this president has
been diminished by it.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Their reputation
has been tarnished.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're smaller people
as a result of it.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's tragic.

10:21.466 --> 10:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does it
give you a glimpse into
the state of Twitter?

10:22.266 --> 10:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

10:23.733 --> 10:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that's the exact
point I was going to make.

10:25.733 --> 10:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I can't think of anybody
whose reputation has been
enhanced by going into the Trump

10:27.400 --> 10:28.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

10:28.933 --> 10:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rex Tillerson was a serious
businessman, well-respected.

10:31.633 --> 10:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions was a
serious senator, pretty
conservative, quite serious.

10:35.133 --> 10:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Spicer was a normal
communications guy in
Congress -- or in Washington.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So he's like an anti-mentor.

10:42.566 --> 10:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He takes everybody around
him and he makes them worse.

10:45.566 --> 10:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that's what
Spicer had to face.

10:47.933 --> 10:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he will have to live
with that and live with
the reputational damage
that he's incurred.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci is a very
interesting case.

10:55.566 --> 10:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a guy from Long Island.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump is from Queens.

11:00.466 --> 11:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They made it big
financially in the big city.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have some sort
of parallel careers.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci is a
very friendly guy.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody is sort of
like a fun game to him.

11:09.533 --> 11:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought his performance
today was quite good, actually.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it could be that he will
flourish in this White House.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's very smart.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not to be intellectually
underestimated.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be he's chief
of staff before long.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we will see.

11:23.966 --> 11:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's someone who has a
much more deft personal manner,
as well -- while being kind

11:30.066 --> 11:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a wild guy, than anybody
else in there right now.

11:32.333 --> 11:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
John McCain, this past week, it
was -- the entire Senate vote

11:38.433 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was delayed because
of a surgery.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it turned out what
they found in that surgery
was much more serious.

11:44.066 --> 11:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

11:45.633 --> 11:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I just think that
John McCain stands alone.

11:49.700 --> 11:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I make no apologies for
thinking that highly of him.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a time when you look at
these people on television,
starting with Scaramucci, a bad

12:02.100 --> 12:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy who has a good performance,
they're flag lapel pin patriots.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain never
wore a flag lapel.

12:09.733 --> 12:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain didn't
wave the flag.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He defended it.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's been a leader in the
United States Senate on so
many issues, and especially,

12:20.866 --> 12:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, not just simply taking
on big tobacco and big money,
but reaching across the aisle.

12:24.333 --> 12:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And de Gaulle said that the
cemeteries of Europe are
full of indispensable men.

12:31.066 --> 12:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would say John McCain
is irreplaceable in
our national life.

12:35.733 --> 12:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I just pray
that he recovers.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Very
briefly to just his
position in the Senate?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have covered him a long time.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we both
think more highly of him.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a man with intense
internal honesty.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sometimes did stuff that
was political, but he always
seemed to -- he never, never

12:49.500 --> 12:51.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lied to himself.

12:51.066 --> 12:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Brooks, Mark Shields.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The transcript of this
will be very clear.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:55.800 --> 12:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Thank you both.

12:56.633 --> 12:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.
