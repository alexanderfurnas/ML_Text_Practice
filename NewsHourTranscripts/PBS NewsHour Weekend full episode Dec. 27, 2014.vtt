SAYING IT HELPS MAINTAIN

07:22.242 --> 07:23.276
COMMUNITY TRUST.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.344
THE POLICY, WHICH WENT INTO

07:24.344 --> 07:26.179
EFFECT IN 2012, HAD BEEN

07:26.179 --> 07:28.315
CHALLENGED BY THE POLICE UNION.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.849
A NEW SURVEY SHOWS THAT A HIGHER

07:29.849 --> 07:31.584
PERCENTAGE OF COLORADANS ARE

07:31.584 --> 07:33.553
REGULARLY USING MARIJUANA NOW

07:33.553 --> 07:35.488
THAT RECREATIONAL USE IS LEGAL

07:35.488 --> 07:36.056
THERE.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.324
THE STUDY BY THE NATIONAL SURVEY

07:37.324 --> 07:38.692
ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH SAYS

07:38.692 --> 07:40.960
ABOUT ONE IN EIGHT PEOPLE THERE

07:40.960 --> 07:43.463
OVER THE AGE OF 12 REPORT USING

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
MARIJUANA IN THE PAST MONTH.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.766
THAT'S UP 22% FROM THE LAST TIME

07:46.766 --> 07:48.335
THE SURVEY WAS TAKEN.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.136
ONLY RHODE ISLAND HAS A HIGHER

07:50.136 --> 07:51.604
RATE OF REGULAR MARIJUANA USE,

07:51.604 --> 07:53.273
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL DATA.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.541
AND A SURVEY OF MORE THAN 1,000

07:54.541 --> 07:55.575
PEOPLE CONDUCTED BY THE

07:55.575 --> 07:57.310
ASSOCIATED PRESS SHOWS THAT

07:57.310 --> 07:58.912
AMERICANS RATE THE RISE OF THE

07:58.912 --> 08:01.081
ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ

08:01.081 --> 08:03.016
AS THE MOST IMPORTANT NEWS STORY

08:03.016 --> 08:04.117
OF THE YEAR.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.251
ALMOST AS IMPORTANT TO SURVEY

08:05.251 --> 08:06.453
RESPONDENTS WAS THE RACIAL

08:06.453 --> 08:07.787
UNREST IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE

08:07.787 --> 08:09.089
KILLINGS OF MICHAEL BROWN AND

08:09.089 --> 08:10.824
ERIC GARNER, AND THE EBOLA

08:10.824 --> 08:12.425
OUTBREAK.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.773
>> Sreenivasan: NORTH KOREA

08:26.773 --> 08:28.375
TODAY BLAMED PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR

08:28.375 --> 08:30.343
SONY'S DECISION TO RELEASE THE

08:30.343 --> 08:31.678
CONTROVERSIAL FILM "THE

08:31.678 --> 08:33.413
INTERVIEW" WHICH TELLS THE STORY

08:33.413 --> 08:34.647
OF A FICTIONAL PLOT TO KILL

08:34.647 --> 08:35.982
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-

08:35.982 --> 08:36.649
UN.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.051
THE RECENT HACKING OF SONY,

08:38.051 --> 08:40.086
WHICH WAS WIDELY BLAMED ON NORTH

08:40.086 --> 08:42.055
KOREA, HAS CAUSED THE OBAMA

08:42.055 --> 08:43.390
ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER NEW

08:43.390 --> 08:44.958
STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST CYBER

08:44.958 --> 08:45.692
ATTACKS.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.726
CAROL LEE OF THE "WALL STREET

08:46.726 --> 08:47.927
JOURNAL" IS IN HAWAII, WHERE THE

08:47.927 --> 08:49.195
PRESIDENT IS VACATIONING, AND

08:49.195 --> 08:50.363
JOINS US NOW FROM HONOLULU.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.432
SO, SONY WAS THE FIRST KIND OF

08:52.432 --> 08:53.733
BIG, RED FLAG.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.001
WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK

08:55.001 --> 08:58.138
IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT FOR

08:58.138 --> 08:59.606
OTHER COMPANIES AROUND THE U.S.?

08:59.606 --> 09:00.473
DO THEY THINK THAT THIS IS THE

09:00.473 --> 09:02.008
THE CYBER THREATS COULD

09:02.008 --> 09:04.310
INCREASE?

09:04.310 --> 09:04.911
>> THEY DO.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.980
AND THEIR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT

09:06.980 --> 09:08.415
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS SONY

09:08.415 --> 09:09.949
ATTACK IS, AS ONE ADMINISTRATION

09:09.949 --> 09:12.252
OFFICIAL PUT IT, THAT IT MARKS A

09:12.252 --> 09:14.554
CROSSING OF A THRESHOLD INTO

09:14.554 --> 09:16.356
THIS KIND OF NEW WAVE OF

09:16.356 --> 09:17.891
CYBERATTACKS THAT'RE ESSENTIALLY

09:17.891 --> 09:21.561
CYBER EXTORTION, WHERE A NATION

09:21.561 --> 09:23.596
STATE OR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION OR

09:23.596 --> 09:26.199
GROUP HACKS INTO A COMPANY-- OR

09:26.199 --> 09:27.934
PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT-- AND

09:27.934 --> 09:30.069
USES THAT AS LEVERAGE TO TRY TO

09:30.069 --> 09:31.704
GET THE COMPANY OR THE

09:31.704 --> 09:32.872
GOVERNMENT TO MEET CERTAIN

09:32.872 --> 09:33.473
DEMANDS.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.974
IN THE INSTANCE WITH SONY, IT

09:34.974 --> 09:37.177
WAS THAT THEY PULL THIS MOVIE

09:37.177 --> 09:39.612
"THE INTERVIEW," AND INITIALLY,

09:39.612 --> 09:41.014
WHAT WAS CONCERNING TO THE WHITE

09:41.014 --> 09:42.749
HOUSE WAS THAT SONY AGREED TO DO

09:42.749 --> 09:45.051
THAT, WHICH BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,

09:45.051 --> 09:47.520
REWARDED THIS ACTION AND, YOU

09:47.520 --> 09:48.988
KNOW, DESPITE THE REVERSAL ON

09:48.988 --> 09:51.458
THAT, THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS LIKE

09:51.458 --> 09:52.959
THIS STILL MARKS A CROSSING OF

09:52.959 --> 09:54.394
THE THRESHOLD AND, YOU KNOW, THE

09:54.394 --> 09:56.362
POSSIBILITY OF SEEING ADDITIONAL

09:56.362 --> 09:58.298
ATTACKS LIKE THIS IS REAL

09:58.298 --> 10:00.533
BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY WORKED.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.368
SO THE WHITE HOUSE IS EXPLORING

10:02.368 --> 10:04.671
SOME NEW WAYS TO TRY TO GET THE

10:04.671 --> 10:06.005
GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE

10:06.005 --> 10:07.941
SECTOR ON THE SAME PAGE IN THIS

10:07.941 --> 10:10.443
AND TO TRY TO COMBAT THIS SO

10:10.443 --> 10:12.612
THAT THESE SORTS OF THINGS ARE

10:12.612 --> 10:14.214
MINIMIZED IN THE FUTURE.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.281
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE

10:15.281 --> 10:16.549
SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT THE

10:16.549 --> 10:18.651
WHITE HOUSE IS TAKING?

10:18.651 --> 10:20.086
>> WELL, THIS WHOLE THING IS

10:20.086 --> 10:21.221
NEW.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.422
THIS IS A NEW AREA IN CYBER

10:22.422 --> 10:23.423
SECURITY.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.091
AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE

10:25.091 --> 10:26.326
PRIVATE SECTOR ARE NOT

10:26.326 --> 10:27.961
NECESSARILY ENTIRELY IN SYNC IN

10:27.961 --> 10:29.696
SOME OF THESE THINGS, AND THAT

10:29.696 --> 10:32.165
WAS-- THAT WAS EXPOSED IN THE

10:32.165 --> 10:34.067
VERY PUBLIC DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN

10:34.067 --> 10:35.568
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SONY

10:35.568 --> 10:37.170
EXECUTIVES OVER WHETHER OR NOT

10:37.170 --> 10:38.438
TO RELEASE THE FILM.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.440
SO, FIRST, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY

10:40.440 --> 10:41.608
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE

10:41.608 --> 10:43.009
WISHED SONY HAD TALKED TO THEM.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.978
SO I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE

10:44.978 --> 10:48.114
SOME ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION AT

10:48.114 --> 10:49.382
VERY HIGH LEVELS AT THE WHITE

10:49.382 --> 10:50.250
HOUSE.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.918
AND CYBER-SECURITY LEGISLATION,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.520
THE PRESIDENT CALLED ON CONGRESS

10:53.520 --> 10:54.821
AGAIN TO PASS SOMETHING

10:54.821 --> 10:55.788
STRICTER.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.023
THE HOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATION

10:57.023 --> 10:58.157
IS THAT COMPANIES NOW HAVE AN

10:58.157 --> 11:00.793
INCENTIVE TO TRY TO GET SOME

11:00.793 --> 11:02.495
SORT OF REGULATIONS OR

11:02.495 --> 11:04.130
STANDARDS IN PLACE BECAUSE

11:04.130 --> 11:05.565
WHAT'S HAPPENED UNTIL NOW IS

11:05.565 --> 11:07.367
THAT THEY'VE RESISTED THAT.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.601
THERE'S DIFFERENT-- THE CHAMBER

11:08.601 --> 11:10.270
OF COMMERCE AND OTHER GROUP--

11:10.270 --> 11:11.704
BUSINESS LOBBYING GROUPS HAVE

11:11.704 --> 11:13.940
SAID SETTING CERTAIN MINIMAL

11:13.940 --> 11:15.275
STANDARDS FOR GROUPS LIKE

11:15.275 --> 11:18.111
BANKING OR ENERGY WOULD BE

11:18.111 --> 11:20.980
BURDENSOME AND COULD LEAD TO

11:20.980 --> 11:23.483
LITIGATION IF SOMEHOW THEY HAD

11:23.483 --> 11:25.652
THOSE STANDARDS AND AN ATTACKER

11:25.652 --> 11:27.287
WAS ABLE TO STILL PENETRATE.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.221
>> Sreenivasan: SOME COMPANIES

11:28.221 --> 11:29.022
HAVE ALSO BEEN BUSH BUSHING BACK

11:29.022 --> 11:30.056
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE

11:30.056 --> 11:31.357
THE GOVERNMENT TOO MUCH ACCESS

11:31.357 --> 11:33.326
TO THEIR CONTENT OR THEIR USERS'

11:33.326 --> 11:35.328
INFORMATION, RIGHT?

11:35.328 --> 11:36.930
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.097
IT'S A REALLY STRANGE

11:38.097 --> 11:39.265
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

11:39.265 --> 11:40.300
GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE

11:40.300 --> 11:41.601
SECTOR BECAUSE TYPICALLY YOU

11:41.601 --> 11:43.102
HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT ACTS AS A

11:43.102 --> 11:45.305
REGULATOR AND COMPANIES THAT ARE

11:45.305 --> 11:46.105
REGULATED.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.041
AND IN THIS INSTANCE, IT'S NOT

11:48.041 --> 11:48.775
LIKE THAT.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.109
AND WHEN YOU THROW IN THESE

11:50.109 --> 11:51.344
ADDED NATIONAL SECURITY

11:51.344 --> 11:53.846
CONCERNS, IT CREATES AN ENTIRELY

11:53.846 --> 11:55.548
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP, AND A

11:55.548 --> 11:57.383
NEW DYNAMIC THAT SORT OF BOTH

11:57.383 --> 11:58.585
SIDES ARE TRYING TO FEEL THEIR

11:58.585 --> 11:59.719
WAY THROUGH.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.021
AND IT'S VERY UNCERTAIN RIGHT

12:02.021 --> 12:03.990
NOW, AND THE WHOLE PROCESS IS

12:03.990 --> 12:05.391
SORT OF PIECEMEAL.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.994
BUT THE HOPE IS, AT LEAST FROM

12:07.994 --> 12:09.228
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIDE, IS

12:09.228 --> 12:12.465
THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME SORT

12:12.465 --> 12:14.200
OF WAY IN WHICH THAT THEY CAN

12:14.200 --> 12:16.469
GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND MORE ON

12:16.469 --> 12:18.037
BOARD AS THEY TRY TO NAVIGATE

12:18.037 --> 12:19.939
THIS STRANGE RELATIONSHIP WHERE

12:19.939 --> 12:21.574
BUSINESSES NEED THE GOVERNMENT

12:21.574 --> 12:24.644
TO BE INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE

12:24.644 --> 12:25.745
THIS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS

12:25.745 --> 12:27.513
THE ONE WHO CAN COME IN AND

12:27.513 --> 12:29.248
ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT

12:29.248 --> 12:31.851
AND DO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
