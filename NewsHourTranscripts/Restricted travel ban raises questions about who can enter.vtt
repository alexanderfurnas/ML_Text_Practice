00:02.066 --> 00:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This final day
of the Supreme Court term has
revived a controversial item

00:05.300 --> 00:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on President Trump's
agenda: his travel ban.

00:08.533 --> 00:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices announced that
they will hear arguments this
fall on the constitutionality

00:13.100 --> 00:15.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the ban.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, they reinstated
a limited version of the
order, affecting travelers

00:20.200 --> 00:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from six mostly-Muslim
countries.

00:22.233 --> 00:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump lauded the Supreme
Court's action today as --
quote -- "a clear victory for

00:27.033 --> 00:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our national security," adding:
"It allows the travel suspension
for the six terror-prone

00:33.933 --> 00:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries and the refugee
suspension to become
largely effective."

00:39.633 --> 00:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We explore the legal and
practical implications
now with our regular
Supreme Court watcher

00:42.600 --> 00:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal," and Alan Gomez.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He covers immigration
for USA Today.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marcia, let's start with you.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's take this one at a time.

00:53.933 --> 00:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got two things that
the court was asked to look at
by the Trump administration,

01:00.100 --> 01:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
first to grant review
on hearing the arguments
on the executive order.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National
Law Journal": Right, Judy.

01:04.866 --> 01:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The legal challenges
to the executive order
focused on basically two
provisions, the 90-day

01:11.366 --> 01:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel ban from six
predominantly Muslim
countries and the 120-day
suspension of the U.S. refugee

01:19.100 --> 01:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assistance program.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government asks the
Supreme Court to review
two federal appellate
court rulings that struck

01:27.566 --> 01:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the executive order, one,
and they ruled separately,
claiming that the order violated

01:33.733 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Establishment Clause of
the constitution because it
was religious discrimination.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a second ground was that
the executive order exceeded
the president's authority under

01:46.233 --> 01:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal immigration
law, a provision, in
particular, that prohibits
discrimination on the basis

01:51.500 --> 01:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nationality.

01:53.533 --> 01:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court said it would
hear arguments on the merits
of those two appellate court

01:58.766 --> 02:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rulings in October.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime
and, separately, the justices
were also asked by the Trump

02:03.466 --> 02:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration to lift the
injunctions that had been
imposed on the travel ban.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did they say about that?

02:10.133 --> 02:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, those two federal appellate
courts had approved injunctions
blocking the travel ban

02:15.566 --> 02:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the suspension of
the refugee program.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court said that the
bans would be lifted only --
would be applied only against

02:29.533 --> 02:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign nationals who had
no bona fide relationship
with an individual or
an entity in the United

02:37.200 --> 02:39.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

02:39.166 --> 02:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the court went on to explain
that in terms of a bona fide
relationship, it should be

02:45.333 --> 02:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a familial relationship with an
individual or, when it comes to
an entity, a formal documented

02:50.633 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship, for example, a
student has been accepted at a
university in the United States.

02:57.633 --> 03:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they were
imposing a -- there had to be
some connection already with the

03:00.933 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Exactly.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For
these individuals.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three justices disagreed
with this partial listing.

03:06.766 --> 03:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did they say?

03:08.900 --> 03:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Justice Thomas
wrote for the dissenters and
was joined by Justices Alito

03:12.000 --> 03:14.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Gorsuch.

03:14.133 --> 03:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Thomas explained --
he was most in disagreement
about the partial lifting of

03:19.633 --> 03:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the injunctions against
the executive order.

03:22.466 --> 03:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it was unworkable,
that it was going to create a
flood gate of litigation as the

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government, as government
officials tried to determine
what is a bona fide relationship

03:32.200 --> 03:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with an individual or an entity?

03:34.766 --> 03:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those three justices would have
kept -- would have allowed the
ban and the executive order

03:40.500 --> 03:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go into full effect.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Alan
Gomez, let me turn to you.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You report, as we said, on
immigration, travel issues.

03:46.966 --> 03:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the immediate
effect of this ruling today?

03:51.100 --> 03:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: The
immediate effect is that this
travel ban or what's left of

03:55.766 --> 03:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it can go into effect
as early as Thursday.

03:59.233 --> 04:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's important to note that,
once it does into effect, this
is going to look very different

04:03.666 --> 04:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from what we saw back in
January, when President
Trump first signed his
first travel ban on

04:08.600 --> 04:10.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 27.

04:10.666 --> 04:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you remember, at the time,
everybody from these countries
was blocked from entering

04:14.233 --> 04:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, so people were
stranded at U.S. airports or
blocked from getting onto their

04:18.933 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S.-bound flights overseas.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But things have changed
dramatically since then.

04:23.733 --> 04:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His revised travel ban
allows for green card
holders to travel, allows
for people who hold

04:27.566 --> 04:29.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
visas to travel.

04:29.666 --> 04:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now what the Supreme Court
has ordered, this establishing
this bona fide relationship

04:36.033 --> 04:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Marcia was explaining a
second ago, that's where we're
going to start trying to figure

04:38.066 --> 04:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out -- that's where
the government is going
to start trying to
figure out who can come

04:41.400 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in and who cannot.

04:43.533 --> 04:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's a lot of gray
area and we do expect to see
some litigation about this,

04:50.466 --> 04:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it's -- it's one thing
if you have a relative in the
U.S. who is trying to claim

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That person can come in.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you have a job offer
from a U.S. employer,
that person can come in.

04:58.733 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what if you're just
businessperson coming over here
to have a couple of meetings on

05:02.700 --> 05:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a short-term visa?

05:04.033 --> 05:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that a bona
fide relationship?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a tourist who already
has hotel reservations and
plane reservations, is that

05:09.733 --> 05:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a bona fide relationship?

05:11.700 --> 05:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what we're going to
start seeing in those first
couple days when the ban finally

05:14.366 --> 05:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goes into effect.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
that's my question.

05:17.266 --> 05:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Just how clear are
these guidelines that
the justices set down?

05:20.966 --> 05:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we assume immigration
officials are scrambling
today to put this in
black and white to figure

05:25.800 --> 05:27.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out?

05:27.900 --> 05:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: There are a lot of
attorneys within the Department
of Justice and Homeland Security

05:30.733 --> 05:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the State Department
and a lot of immigration
advocacy attorneys who
are just diving into

05:37.700 --> 05:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whatever case law,
whatever precedents they
can find to figure out
what exactly this bona

05:40.100 --> 05:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fide relationship is.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The justices provided
a few examples that we
have cited already, if
you have a job offer,

05:46.200 --> 05:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you have been admitted
to a U.S. university and if
you have a direct relative.

05:50.733 --> 05:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But beyond that, it's
pretty much wide open now.

05:54.066 --> 05:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're trying to figure
out what that means.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To give some context here, in
2016, about 108,000 people came
to the United States legally

06:02.666 --> 06:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from these six countries.

06:04.833 --> 06:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From a quick accounting of
that, the majority of them will
still be allowed to enter the

06:08.300 --> 06:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country under the guidelines
set forth by the Supreme Court,
because most of those were

06:14.733 --> 06:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees, had no direct ties
that we're talking about.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:17.766 --> 06:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: But once we get
into some of that other visa
categories that the relationship

06:20.866 --> 06:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a little bit more tenuous,
that is what has to play out
in the next few weeks, to

06:24.733 --> 06:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what government determines
to be a bona fide relationship
and whether the courts agree

06:29.166 --> 06:30.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with them.

06:30.633 --> 06:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very final
quick question, Alan.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The travel ban that was issued
by the president last March was
intended to be temporary while

06:38.400 --> 06:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the government figured
out vetting procedures.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They said it was
going to take 90 days.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does that stand?

06:44.566 --> 06:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, that review
finally started last week.

06:47.733 --> 06:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a separate ruling, the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco sort of

06:51.933 --> 06:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separated that vetting review
from this legal case that we're
going through right now and

06:56.733 --> 07:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that the administration can
start conducting that review.

07:00.166 --> 07:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In short, what they're trying
to do is gauge what kind of
information we get from foreign

07:04.733 --> 07:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governments to screen people
coming into the country.

07:07.766 --> 07:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they just started
doing that last Monday.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so, right, the
clock starts now.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have -- they're going to
review it for 20 days, submit
a list to the president.

07:17.033 --> 07:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then those governments will have
50 days to get off the list.

07:19.866 --> 07:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And at the conclusion
of that vetting review,
then the president can
decide whether he wants

07:24.400 --> 07:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to impose more or fewer travel
restrictions against different
countries around the country

07:28.733 --> 07:29.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - or world.

07:29.733 --> 07:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alan Gomez, USA Today,
Marcia Coyle, thank you both.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.
