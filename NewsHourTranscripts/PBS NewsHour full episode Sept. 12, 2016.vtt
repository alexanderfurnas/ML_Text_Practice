GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.474 --> 00:09.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Hillary Clinton takes a break
from campaigning after a
pneumonia

00:14.514 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
diagnosis -- why both
candidates' health is playing a
major role this presidential
election.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I travel to Colorado

Republican area of the

00:24.758 --> 00:26.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

00:26.493 --> 00:30.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, the choices
are dismal, I think.

00:30.097 --> 00:37.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just kind of a weird time,
a weird election, sort of sad in
a sense, I guess.

00:37.204 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: deep
corruption in the world's
youngest nation.

00:42.075 --> 00:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A report reveals South Sudan's

00:46.179 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: And
Rethinking College.

00:49.383 --> 00:54.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first installment of our new
series looks at the first urban
work college in the country.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

00:57.557 --> 01:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL, President, Paul
Quinn College: Our students are
getting two forms of education.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're getting a rigorous
liberal arts training, and
they're also getting real world
work experience.

01:05.499 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:11.638 --> 01:15.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.509 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The questions are
swirling in the presidential
campaign this evening:

01:26.386 --> 01:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do voters know about
the candidates' health, and how
much should they know?

01:30.657 --> 01:34.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The issue leaped to the
fore in the last 24 hours.

01:34.328 --> 01:38.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: She was diagnosed
with pneumonia on Friday.

01:38.065 --> 01:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The cable news
banners told the story, Hillary
Clinton's health front

01:43.470 --> 01:48.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and center, after she appeared
to stumble when she abruptly
left Sunday's 9/11 ceremony

01:48.375 --> 01:51.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in New York City.

01:51.511 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hours later, her doctor said the
68-year-old Democratic nominee
had been diagnosed with

01:55.849 --> 01:59.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pneumonia last Friday.

01:59.453 --> 02:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Clinton campaign pledged
today that more information on
her health is forthcoming.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN FALLON, Clinton Campaign
Spokesman: We're going to be
releasing that to further

02:06.927 --> 02:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put to rest any lingering
concerns about what you saw
yesterday.

02:10.330 --> 02:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really is the case that there
is no other undisclosed
condition.

02:14.701 --> 02:19.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton scrapped
a California trip, and instead
planned to phone in to a

02:19.206 --> 02:22.909 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
San Francisco
fund-raiser tonight.

02:22.909 --> 02:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And late today, she tweeted:
"I'm feeling fine and getting
better."

02:27.981 --> 02:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left running mate Tim Kaine
to take up the issue in Dayton,
Ohio.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate: I have
just been on the campaign since
July

02:34.554 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
22.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has been on
the trail for 18 months.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Her energy staggers me.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have a hard time
keeping up with her.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:46.500 --> 02:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Republican Donald Trump was
restrained in his reaction.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: But I just hope that
she gets well, and gets

02:51.004 --> 02:53.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back on the trail.

02:53.507 --> 02:57.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump has
released little about his own
health, but promised today he
will

02:57.310 --> 02:59.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be putting out more
information as well.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: This last
week, I took a physical.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will be releasing
when the numbers come in.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hopefully, they're
going to be good.

03:08.588 --> 03:09.489 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think they're
going to be good.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I feel great.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when the numbers come in, I
will be releasing very, very
specific numbers.

03:15.962 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump's main
focus today was a different
issue: Clinton's Friday night

03:20.333 --> 03:23.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comments about his supporters.

03:23.070 --> 03:27.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's fodder for a new
Trump campaign ad.

03:27.107 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: You
could put half of Trump's
supporters into

03:30.077 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I call the basket of
deplorables, the racist, sexist,
homophobic, xenophobic,
Islamophobic,

03:36.316 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you name it.

03:38.118 --> 03:41.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: People like you,
you, and you, deplorable.

03:41.588 --> 03:46.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was fodder
for Trump himself on the
campaign trail today during

03:46.093 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a speech in Baltimore.

03:48.495 --> 03:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have the
support of cops, and soldiers,
carpenters and welders, the

03:53.567 --> 03:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young and the old, and millions
of working-class families.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These were among the countless
Americans that Hillary Clinton
called deplorable, irredeemable,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and un-American.

04:03.743 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump's next
stop, one of the battleground
states, North Carolina, this

04:10.083 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evening.

04:13.353 --> 04:17.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will examine the issue of
presidential candidates' health
more fully after the news

04:17.791 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: a cease-fire in Syria
negotiated by the U.S. and
Russia

04:24.464 --> 04:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is now officially in force.

04:27.667 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took effect at sunset,
although government attacks
continued in the city of Aleppo.

04:32.639 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad appeared in a
recaptured Damascus suburb,

04:36.943 --> 04:41.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and insisted he means to control
the whole country again.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through translator): The
Syrian state is determined

04:44.751 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to recover every area from the
terrorists, to restore safety
and security, to rebuild,

04:50.090 --> 04:53.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rebuild the infrastructure,
to rebuild whatever is destroyed
by all means.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We call upon all Syrians to
move towards reconciliation.

04:57.364 --> 05:01.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A number of rebel
groups expressed misgivings
about the agreement, including

05:01.268 --> 05:03.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over how it would be enforced.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Later, Secretary of State
John Kerry defended the deal.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He even talked of approving
Syrian strikes against al-Qaida
militants once known as the

05:11.144 --> 05:13.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Nusra Front.

05:13.780 --> 05:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Assad is not supposed to
be bombing the opposition

05:18.685 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because there is a cease-fire.

05:21.688 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, he is allowed and will be
to target Nusra, but that would
be on strikes that are agreed

05:26.526 --> 05:29.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
upon with Russia and
the United States.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That would mark the
first U.S. cooperation with the
Assad government since

05:32.599 --> 05:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Syrian civil war began.

05:35.702 --> 05:39.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Within hours, the State
Department walked it back,
saying there is no such
provision

05:39.472 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the agreement.

05:42.008 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China today
rejected U.S. calls that it do
more to stop North Korea's
nuclear

05:46.746 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

05:48.748 --> 05:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It came days after the North
conducted a fifth nuclear test.

05:53.086 --> 05:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Beijing, the foreign ministry
said Washington stoked the
tensions, and should bear the
brunt

05:57.023 --> 05:59.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of dealing with it.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (through translator):
The

06:02.295 --> 06:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nub of the North Korean nuclear
issue is not in China, but in
the United States.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. should earnestly work
on a tangible and effective
solution.

06:09.502 --> 06:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an old saying in China:
Whoever started the trouble
should end it.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thus, the U.S. should take
on its due responsibility.

06:16.676 --> 06:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Chinese
spokeswoman also voiced doubts
about U.S. calls for new
sanctions

06:20.313 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against the North.

06:22.749 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, South Korea warned
that the North is ready to set
off another nuclear blast

06:26.186 --> 06:29.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at any time.

reeling from disastrous flooding
after a typhoon hit late last
month.

06:34.794 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.N. report says the storm

06:40.600 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Rodrigo Duterte is now demanding

06:52.946 --> 06:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. withdraw all troops
from his country's south.

06:57.817 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. has advisers there
working with Philippine troops
against pro-al-Qaida fighters.

07:03.056 --> 07:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, in Manila, Duterte blamed
the American presence for
inflaming Islamist groups.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President (through translator):
There are a lot of Americans,

07:10.997 --> 07:14.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
white people there,
and they have to go.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The conflict there will only get
worse if they see American
soldiers, and there will

07:17.270 --> 07:19.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be more bloodshed.

07:19.639 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Duterte said the
bad blood goes back to U.S.
efforts to stamp out Muslim

07:24.044 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebellions in the early 1900's,
when the Philippines was a U.S.
colony.

GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, newly discovered
documents show the sugar
industry began funding

07:34.187 --> 07:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
research decades ago to dismiss
links between sugar and heart
disease.

07:39.292 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The journal "JAMA Internal
Medicine" today published an
analysis of correspondence
between

07:43.863 --> 07:47.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the industry and
Harvard researchers.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said the resulting studies
successfully cast doubt about
the hazards of sucrose, while

07:50.904 --> 07:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
promoting fat as the culprit.

07:53.940 --> 07:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And soccer
injuries are soaring among
American children.

08:03.149 --> 08:07.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
78 percent between
1990 and 2014.

08:07.287 --> 08:11.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was fueled, in
part, by concussions.

08:11.124 --> 08:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers at the Nationwide
Children's Hospital in Columbus,
Ohio, say that it's also due

08:15.395 --> 08:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to soccer's growing popularity.

08:18.264 --> 08:22.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street
recovered some today from
Friday's big losses.

08:22.602 --> 08:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 239 points to close at
18325.

08:27.841 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 86 points
and the S&amp;P 500 added 31.

08:34.013 --> 08:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": the debate over
the public's right to know

08:38.084 --> 08:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about presidential nominees'
health; lifelong Republicans
rethinking their loyalty in the

08:44.424 --> 08:49.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traditionally swing state of
Colorado; calling out South
Sudanese leaders for getting
rich

08:49.229 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
off the country's
troubles; and much more.

09:03.977 --> 09:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a closer look at just how
much the public has a right to
know about the health of the

09:08.948 --> 09:13.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
American president or a
presidential candidate, and what
earlier presidents have and have

09:13.920 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not disclosed about their
personal health histories.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For that, we turn to
Dr. Howard Markel.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's director of the Center for
the History of Medicine at the
University of Michigan.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's also author of a number of
books on health and infectious
diseases.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Markel, welcome.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's campaign says
that her pneumonia is not
severe.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.110 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Just how serious
can pneumonia be?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

09:39.746 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL, Director, Center
for the History of Medicine,
University of Michigan: Well,

09:39.512 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pneumonia can be quite serious.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People can die of it.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They used to call it the old
man's friend in the years before
antibiotics.

09:47.554 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now with taking antibiotics,
taking care of yourself and
resting, it is quite an easy

09:52.425 --> 09:55.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thing to treat.

09:55.228 --> 10:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw -- I guess
it was just reported this
afternoon on Politico that
Hillary

10:00.800 --> 10:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton's staff is saying she
doesn't prefer to drink water
often.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Could that have contributed
to what happened yesterday?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL: Absolutely.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Think about it.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're tired, you're sick,
you're out in the sun, which
dehydrates us all, whether we're

10:15.315 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aware of it or not.

10:18.218 --> 10:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that could very well have
been what caused that wobbly
step that everyone has seen and

10:22.021 --> 10:24.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked about today.

10:24.591 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you, both of these campaigns,
both Trump and Clinton

10:29.162 --> 10:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are now saying, in the next few
days, they are going to be
releasing fuller medical
histories,

10:34.234 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're going to know more
about their medical story.

10:38.071 --> 10:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do the American voters
have a right to know?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What should people know in order
to know whether these two
individuals are healthy or not?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, I
think it's very important.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think American voters do
have the right to know about the
health of the people who

10:52.852 --> 10:58.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are running for the most
powerful job in the world.

10:58.157 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is very easy to present one's
health history, and yet it's
become very tangled and diffuse,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just like people's tax returns.

11:06.466 --> 11:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think both these pieces of
information are valid for people
to ask about.

11:11.437 --> 11:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so what are
some aspects of their health
that you think should be
disclosed

11:17.410 --> 11:18.678 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
when they do put
these histories out?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

11:21.281 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, I think
just the basic top-to-bottom
physical examination, mental

11:25.451 --> 11:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health examination, a recording
of the medications they may or
may not take, past illnesses,

11:31.357 --> 11:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illnesses that may run in their
family, a general medical
history.

11:35.161 --> 11:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, remember, this hasn't
really been done all that much
since 1992.

11:40.300 --> 11:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was Paul Tsongas who
didn't tell the American people
precisely about his
non-Hodgkin's

11:45.905 --> 11:47.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lymphoma.

11:47.106 --> 11:47.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said he was cured.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He wasn't.

11:50.376 --> 11:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Had he won the rest of the
campaign and run for president,
he probably would have been

11:55.148 --> 11:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quite ill during his presidency.

11:57.183 --> 12:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So these things do matter.

12:00.753 --> 12:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's one more piece
of information that we as voters
have a right to know about.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
there are other examples as
well.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People think of John F.
Kennedy, Addison's disease.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL: That's right.

12:11.230 --> 12:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a number
of other presidents.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD MARKEL: Yes.

12:15.001 --> 12:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really back to Kennedy, or
Roosevelt or even Woodrow
Wilson's health, these were an

12:20.006 --> 12:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
era where medicine could not do
all that much for these serious
diseases.

12:25.211 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, more and more people are
living full and healthy lives
with chronic illnesses.

12:30.249 --> 12:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have got to tell you,
having turned 50 myself quite a
few years ago, the warranty

12:35.088 --> 12:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on your body runs out at that
point, and we all have problems
with our bodies.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so Mrs. Clinton's pneumonia
is community-acquired.

12:43.830 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very normal thing to do
to contract, particularly when
you're shaking hands, and

12:48.935 --> 12:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working a grueling campaign, and
flying on airplanes and stuff.

12:54.407 --> 12:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to tell you that most
doctors would give the advice,
why don't you take a break

12:58.878 --> 13:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from this grueling campaign for
a day or so and rest, like any
human being whose body

13:03.416 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gets sick?

13:05.018 --> 13:05.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
you mentioned age.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton is 68.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is 70.

13:11.290 --> 13:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much is age a factor in
this, as you describe, grueling
job they both want to take on?

13:16.262 --> 13:18.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, it's hard
to say with each 70-year-old.

13:21.801 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One 70-year-old may be quite
fatigued by this type of a
schedule.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other people -- and it seems Mr.
Trump and Mrs. Clinton are those
types -- are energized

13:30.476 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by it.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it really is a case-by-case
person -- case-by-case
situation.

13:36.182 --> 13:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, most people over
65 should get a pneumonia shot
and also should get a

13:40.920 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
flu shot every year.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's something you can do.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's hard to say.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These sounds like extremely
energetic people.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They sound like very
healthy people.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a little puzzled why they
just don't tell us what's going
on.

13:53.366 --> 13:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, again, as
we prepare to see whatever these
campaigns release, how

13:58.271 --> 13:59.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will we know we're
getting the full story?

13:59.972 --> 14:01.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

14:01.908 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOWARD MARKEL: That is
difficult, and we don't know.

14:05.211 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And particularly the briefer the
report is, there may be stuff
that you're not seeing,

14:11.150 --> 14:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or you could get a data dump,
like John McCain did a few years
back where he released thousands

14:17.523 --> 14:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of pages of his medical history
and gave journalists only about
three or four hours to review
them.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm a medical professor, and I
couldn't do it in that time.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's different ways that
people can be somewhat shifty or
less than transparent

14:29.902 --> 14:32.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with their health data.

14:32.405 --> 14:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's high time in this
modern era of great medicine and
great health prevention

14:39.112 --> 14:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that our presidential candidates
just tell us what is going on in
their bodies.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can make those decisions
one way or the other.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will be
looking for what each campaign
has to say in the coming

14:48.454 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dr. Howard Markel, we thank you.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWARD MARKEL: Thank you.

14:54.160 --> 14:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on our Web
site, you can find a guide to
pneumonia, what causes it

14:58.331 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what makes it a potentially
dangerous illness.

15:00.767 --> 15:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

15:04.337 --> 15:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on how
health issues are dogging
Hillary Clinton and raising
questions

15:09.575 --> 15:13.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of transparency for both
candidates, it's time for
Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith

15:13.679 --> 15:18.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of NPR and Susan Page,
Washington bureau chief for USA
Today.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, we just heard Dr. Markel
say the warranty begins to run
out after 50, and he doesn't

15:22.421 --> 15:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understand why people just don't
tell us what their issues are.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How did health become
central to this campaign?

15:28.494 --> 15:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, Hillary Clinton did
have a coughing fit about

15:32.732 --> 15:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week ago on the campaign trail
that interrupted a press
conference and also later --
earlier

15:37.303 --> 15:42.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interrupted a rally
where she was speaking.

15:42.241 --> 15:48.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was -- there was already a
lot circulating about her health
that was completely
unsubstantiated,

15:48.381 --> 15:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of rumors, conspiracy
theories, and Donald Trump
talking about her stamina.

15:55.388 --> 16:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this was floating in the
ether, when, yesterday, at the
9/11 commemoration, she faltered
as

16:00.893 --> 16:03.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she was leaving.

16:03.095 --> 16:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her knees buckled and she had
trouble getting into her van.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She took off in that van.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the press wasn't
allowed to follow.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And about 90 minutes later, the
campaign said, well, she's at
Chelsea Clinton's house.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's feeling better,
and she was overheated.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.047 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Then
hours later said...

16:21.047 --> 16:22.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Then
hours later...

16:22.815 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, it seemed like
a long time if you were covering
it, I'm sure.

16:24.350 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For those of who weren't
paying as close attention...

16:24.617 --> 16:26.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:26.252 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, it
was about 5:00 p.m.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It was
the end of the day.

16:28.254 --> 16:28.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: It was
the end of the day...

16:28.721 --> 16:31.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: ... when the
doctor, her doctor, released a
statement saying she was
overheated,

16:35.061 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dehydrated, and, oh, by the way,
on Friday, three days earlier,
was diagnosed with pneumonia,

16:40.533 --> 16:42.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they hadn't told
anyone about that before.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's
the point, Susan.

16:45.037 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was this really about -- is our
concern really about her health
or is it about the fact of

16:49.108 --> 16:52.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the failure to disclose
in a timely fashion?

16:52.144 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today: I think both
things are issues.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she will now need to
come out and show that she's
healthy and vigorous and has

16:55.982 --> 16:58.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stamina.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has -- the fact that she was
diagnosed with pneumonia, and we
didn't know about it,

17:01.487 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and had this incident caught on
a video has legitimized some of
the critiques that Trump

17:07.660 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Rudy Giuliani in particular
have been making that she's --
that there's some question

17:10.196 --> 17:11.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about her health.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:12.932 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump,
who has not released his...

17:13.566 --> 17:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: His own
health records.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: OK, just
to make that point.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, absolutely.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think her failure to
disclose it is also an issue.

17:20.106 --> 17:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it goes to a different
vulnerability she has, which is,
is she straightforward with

17:23.542 --> 17:25.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Americans whose
votes she wants to get?

17:25.945 --> 17:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And they say there
is a higher standard for the
woman candidate.

17:27.613 --> 17:28.714 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's what the
Clinton people say.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
They do.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They do say that.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they say that they are going
to meet that higher standard.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They both -- say that they
have already released more.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have released more health
records, they have released more
tax records than Donald

17:39.058 --> 17:41.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say they will release yet
more health records to prove
that this pneumonia isn't

17:43.896 --> 17:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of something larger.

17:47.433 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was a tweet today from
David Axelrod, the adviser to
President Obama back when he

17:53.239 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was running for president, that
really sums up what Susan is
talking about.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says: "Antibiotics can
take care of pneumonia.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the cure for an unhealthy
penchant for privacy that
repeatedly creates unnecessary

18:04.617 --> 18:05.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems?"

18:05.651 --> 18:06.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's privacy.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about something that
she did in full view of everyone
on Friday night.

18:11.557 --> 18:15.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She gave a speech at a
fund-raiser given for her by a
gay and lesbian group.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she said this:

18:18.364 --> 18:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: To just
be grossly generalistic, you
could

18:25.004 --> 18:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put half of Trump's supporters
into what I call the basket of
deplorables, right, the

18:28.140 --> 18:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racist, sexist, homophobic,
xenophobic, Islamophobic, you
name it.

18:39.251 --> 18:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, here's the
other thing that she also said.

18:45.725 --> 18:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said: "But the other basket
-- and I know this because I see
friends from all over America

18:50.463 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here -- I see friends from
Florida, from Georgia, and South
Carolina, and Texas, as well you

18:55.368 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, New York and California"
-- she is basically going on to
say that this -- "I'm sorry.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't finish reading it.

19:01.507 --> 19:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will finish reading it: "But
that other basket of people are
people who feel that

19:05.811 --> 19:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government has let them
down, nobody cares about them,
nobody worries about what
happens

19:08.981 --> 19:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to their lives and their futures
and they are just desperate for
change."

19:12.651 --> 19:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of attention, Susan, given
to what she said about the Trump
-- the half of Trump

19:18.324 --> 19:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporters who are deplorables,
but not a lot given to the --
what she said about the

19:21.060 --> 19:23.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other half.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: First of all, if a
candidate is starting a sentence
with let's be grossly

19:25.064 --> 19:26.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
generalistic...

19:26.632 --> 19:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She should stop.

19:28.234 --> 19:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: ... you do not
want to finish that sentence.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is never a good idea.

19:30.936 --> 19:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is true she was trying to
make a more complicated point,
as Barack Obama at a similar

19:34.673 --> 19:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment eight years ago, when he
talked about some voters
clinging to guns and religion.

19:39.211 --> 19:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was trying to make a larger
point about the frustration and
angst that voters feel.

19:44.617 --> 19:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what came across, I think,
was kind of an elitist statement
at a fancy fund-raiser

19:49.155 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about millions of
Americans who are support her
opponent.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, if she wins the
White House, as she hopes to do,
these are Americans she

19:55.528 --> 19:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be seeking to represent.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, here is the
thing I'm curious about.

20:00.132 --> 20:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is what she said true, or is the
way she said it the problem?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said that half of Donald
Trump's supporters -- and half
of them do believe that Muslims

20:06.072 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should be banned.

20:07.606 --> 20:10.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Half of them do believe
that blacks are lazy.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half of them do say they believe
many of the more offensive
things that he has said from

20:13.145 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the stump.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is what she said wrong?

20:16.782 --> 20:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, what she
said about what she said, she
released a statement that was

20:19.652 --> 20:22.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
described as sort
of walking it back.

20:22.154 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said, I shouldn't have said
half and I shouldn't have been
so grossly generalistic.

20:27.693 --> 20:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the challenge, the real
challenge, is when you start a
conversation with people

20:31.597 --> 20:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by labeling them.

20:33.966 --> 20:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And instead she could easily
talk about the behavior.

20:38.671 --> 20:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She could talk about Donald
Trump retweeting white
nationalist memes or things like
that.

20:44.110 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She can do the thing that she's
done many times before, without
targeting the voters

20:50.349 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and without creating a sound
bite that immediately shows up
in a Donald Trump ad.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And instead she's
given him the ammunition to
accuse her of intolerance.

20:57.490 --> 21:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And that's been one
of the strongest issues she's
had against him, including with

21:02.094 --> 21:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some voters who traditionally
vote Republican and are uneasy
about him.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think there are a few
supporters of Donald Trump who
are deplorable.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Duke is deplorable.

21:10.803 --> 21:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other Trump supporters may have
views you think are deplorable,
but they are not deplorable.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're Americans who are
looking at this election and
trying to make the right
decision

21:18.077 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for them and their families.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And candidates need
to acknowledge that.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's the other
basket I guess she was talking
about.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about this wonderful
piece of -- wonderful in that it
was a great piece of reporting

21:27.219 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in The Washington Post.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Fahrenthold from The
Washington Post went through
everything that -- went through

21:33.926 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Trump charities,
essentially, and found out that
-- a couple of interesting
things

21:37.663 --> 21:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just by going through public
records, among them, that Donald
Trump raises money -- raises

21:41.467 --> 21:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other people's money and then
doles it out under the name of
the Trump charities.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kind of remarkable.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and that
Donald Trump gets credit for it,
but that he hasn't put his

21:49.408 --> 21:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own money in for several years.

21:52.611 --> 21:56.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This reporting is really solid.

21:56.615 --> 22:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the kind of reporting
that we all should aspire to,
where you go through the

22:00.319 --> 22:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
records, you're methodical.

22:02.855 --> 22:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been calling hundreds of
these charities, trying to find
out which donations were given

22:06.659 --> 22:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and from what pots of money.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Very impressive reporting.

22:11.864 --> 22:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in one case,
actually solicited -- broke the
law by using some of that money

22:15.534 --> 22:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to buy a 6-foot-tall painting of
himself at auction, or Melania

22:19.138 --> 22:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, how does
something that, which maybe on a
day like today, how does

22:23.609 --> 22:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that compare to the Clinton
Foundation questions that have
been raised?

SUSAN PAGE: You know what's
remarkable is that these are
devastating -- this is a
devastating

22:30.549 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story that's solidly
backed by public records.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not some leak from
some anonymous source.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it seems to have very much
lost impact than the Clinton
Foundation stories have toward

22:40.259 --> 22:41.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.129 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And I'm not 100
percent sure why.

22:44.129 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Susan Page of USA

thank you both.

GWEN IFILL: Sticking with
politics, Colorado is a state
typically considered a crucial

23:04.116 --> 23:07.319 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
battleground in
presidential elections.

23:07.319 --> 23:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this year, Hillary Clinton
is polling well ahead of rival
Donald Trump.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has caused no small amount
of concern for Republican voters
in the reddest part

23:14.460 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the state.

23:15.894 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spent the weekend
talking to them.

23:20.466 --> 23:30.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A crisp, sunny football
afternoon at the U.S. Air Force
Academy.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Football is easy.

23:31.877 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Air Force crushed Georgia State.

23:35.714 --> 23:39.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But politics is more
complicated, especially this
year, in the heart of one of the
most

23:39.451 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conservative counties
in Colorado.

23:42.788 --> 23:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eli Bremer, a former local party
chairman, supports nominee
Donald Trump now, but only

23:49.962 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after his first and second
choices, Marco Rubio and Jeb
Bush, flamed out.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you ended up with Trump
because he's the nominee or
because he was your third-best

23:57.303 --> 23:59.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice?

23:59.972 --> 24:00.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELI BREMER, Former Local
Republican Party Chairman: I
have always found him an
interesting

24:00.072 --> 24:02.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Interesting can be good.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Interesting can be bad.

24:05.311 --> 24:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when he became the nominee,
I said I can support his
candidate.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't have to like
everything about him.

24:10.816 --> 24:14.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I like a number
of things about him.

24:14.853 --> 24:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got evangelicals and
religious voters who've always
consistently been on the
conservative

24:18.290 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this election, there's
questions, will they show up for
Trump?

24:22.995 --> 24:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The questions, in
Colorado, a state in the habit
of picking the winner,

24:26.098 --> 24:29.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go broad and deep.

24:29.034 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are loyal, Republicans
like Dan and Tami Scase (ph),
military retirees, who feel

24:32.705 --> 24:34.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's their duty to vote.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This year, they are stuck.

24:36.842 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, the choices
are dismal, I think.

24:40.512 --> 24:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just kind of a weird time,
a weird election, sort of sad in
a sense, I guess, tragic, but

24:51.890 --> 24:52.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mostly it's just weird.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I think.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What do
you think, Tami?

24:55.561 --> 24:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it's goofy,
because we have no choice.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have -- maybe the
Libertarians are coming up.

25:00.966 --> 25:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't be surprised if this
is a really close election.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Because you would
vote for a third choice, rather
than Hillary Clinton or Donald

25:07.606 --> 25:08.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

25:08.707 --> 25:11.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: I would.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Scases are

some of the most conflicted

25:14.680 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans in the country.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You would think that in a place
with five separate military
installations that went

25:21.787 --> 25:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slam dunk for Mitt Romney four
years ago, Donald Trump would be
overwhelmingly popular.

25:27.493 --> 25:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here in deep-red El Paso
County, his support appears far
softer than expected.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARON MCCORMICK, Former Romney
Supporter: I was an active

25:34.600 --> 25:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Karon McCormick
is part of the reason why.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In 2012, she was devoted
to Mitt Romney.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.539 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
KARON MCCORMICK:
I love that man.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

This year?

25:48.981 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARON MCCORMICK: I have been a
lifetime Republican and have
switched to independent because
Mr.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is just too embarrassing
for me to support.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He doesn't represent
the party of Lincoln.

25:58.190 --> 26:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't want to lower my
standards to dirt level to
support him just to beat Hillary

26:02.127 --> 26:03.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I will be supporting her.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do your Republican
friends look at you and think
that you have lost your mind?

26:07.800 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARON MCCORMICK: Yes.

else.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think he would be
dangerous as a president.

because there's no way we
shouldn't win this state.

26:41.967 --> 26:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are great people, heavy
military, tremendous respect for
their police and law and order.

26:47.473 --> 26:48.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's me.

which is a reliably conservative
area of the state, evangelically

27:07.392 --> 27:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

does he have to do very well
here in order to offset that?

27:12.297 --> 27:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TOM CRONIN, Colorado
College: Correct.

27:15.133 --> 27:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
El Paso County and some nearby
counties, as well as rural
Colorado, is decidedly
Republican.

27:19.938 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will do well, but he
probably won't do well enough to
offset Denver, Boulder,

27:24.743 --> 27:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the suburbs of Denver.

27:28.947 --> 27:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That matches up with
recent Colorado polling that
shows Clinton with a comfortable

GWEN IFILL: David Flaherty
runs the Magellan Poll.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID FLAHERTY: Our latest poll
shows Hillary up by five points,
41 to 36 percent right

27:45.697 --> 27:48.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

27:48.300 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Honestly, what's going is, we're
getting about 13 percent going
for the Libertarian, Gary

27:52.437 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Johnson, unlike here in 2012,
where if you were not thrilled
with Mitt Romney, you kind

27:56.708 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of had nowhere to go.

27:59.111 --> 28:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, with Gary Johnson gaining
traction in our latest survey,
he's getting almost one-quarter

28:02.648 --> 28:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the unaffiliated voters here.

28:05.784 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I feel that those voters
that perhaps would normally go
into Hillary's column, or

28:09.187 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lean into her column, they
actually have a viable option at
this time in Gary Johnson.

28:13.258 --> 28:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Among that 13
percent, hard-core Republicans,
like intelligence analyst and

neither Trump nor Clinton.

28:24.336 --> 28:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON CALHOUN, Gary Johnson
supporter: I can't think of a
perfect candidate at this point.

28:28.574 --> 28:31.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you essentially
have three options.

28:31.476 --> 28:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have three people that are
going to be on the ballot in all
50 states.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you really have to
decide between one of them.

28:38.650 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that it's -- I'm not
saying that the two-party system
is rigged and corrupt

28:44.790 --> 28:46.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and broken or anything.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just think it's time for
a third voice in there.

28:49.494 --> 28:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that Governor
Johnson offers that best
opportunity for us to start
hearing each

28:52.564 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other again.

lot of confusion and conflict in
this election.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have never seen
anything quite like it.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it's interesting.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have heard a lot of things.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will tell you some of the
things I have heard: "I don't
like him."

29:31.436 --> 29:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the way I respond to that
is, since when do we have to
like our candidate to elect

29:35.040 --> 29:37.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a candidate?

29:37.843 --> 29:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, sometimes, the lord will
choose candidates that may not
fit everybody's criteria, but

29:42.247 --> 29:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're capable candidates.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like to remind people
we're not electing a pastor in
chief.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a commander in chief.

29:50.355 --> 29:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Karon McCormick, the
Romney-turned-Clinton supporter,
got three Trump fund-raising
pitches

29:55.227 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in her mail in one day last
week, a sign that no one is
writing this state off, not yet.

30:05.303 --> 30:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:16.882 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
struggling urban college
rethinks its mission and puts

30:22.087 --> 30:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its students to work, plus,
rebuilding an iconic Afghan
palace brought to ruin by years

30:27.859 --> 30:28.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Sudan

30:31.463 --> 30:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first: South Sudan is the
world's newest country, gaining
independence from Sudan in

30:35.434 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2011.

30:37.736 --> 30:42.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, two years later, civil war
broke out in the small East
African nation.

30:42.774 --> 30:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Though a peace agreement was
signed in 2015, sporadic
fighting continues.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Millions have been displaced,
while rival leaders fight for
power and the country's

30:51.583 --> 30:54.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oil and mineral wealth.

30:54.820 --> 30:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A two-year-long investigation
into those leaders and their
allies revealed billions have
been

30:58.824 --> 31:01.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looted from the country.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"NewsHour" producer P.J.
Tobia has our story

31:04.062 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Some viewers may
find some of the imagery
disturbing.

31:08.467 --> 31:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Small, poor and
dangerous, the U.N. has called
South Sudan one of the most

31:14.239 --> 31:18.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
horrendous human rights
situations in the world.

31:18.110 --> 31:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fighters loyal to the president,
Salva Kiir, have been battling
those backing former Vice

31:22.247 --> 31:24.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Riek Machar for
most of the last four years.

31:24.850 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Caught in the crossfire are
Sudan's impoverished civilians.

31:30.088 --> 31:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than two million South
Sudanese have been displaced by
the fighting.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tens of thousands
have been killed.

31:36.995 --> 31:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. found that, in just six
months last year, 1,300 women
were raped by fighters in

31:41.066 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one South Sudanese state alone.

31:44.736 --> 31:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A report released today by The
Sentry, a rights group in
Washington, accuses the leaders
who've

31:49.741 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
orchestrated this brutality of
making billions off the
conflict.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Actor George Clooney wrote
the foreword to the report.

31:55.781 --> 31:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Hotel Rwanda" star Don Cheadle
also works with The Sentry.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both were at the National Press
Club this morning to talk about
the investigation.

32:02.454 --> 32:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE CLOONEY, Actor: This
is pretty explosive stuff.

32:05.357 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're talking about the
president and the ousted vice
president, along with all of
their

32:11.196 --> 32:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generals, that we're able to
prove without any question that
not only are they committing

32:18.003 --> 32:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these crimes which they have
already been accused of, but
that they're profiting off

32:20.505 --> 32:23.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The report outlines
how South Sudan's political
leaders, generals and their

32:26.077 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families have used the chaos of
war to generate vast sums of
wealth.

32:29.981 --> 32:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have built mansions across
the world, from Uganda and Kenya
to Australia.

32:34.853 --> 32:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That young woman flashing the
peace sign from the sunroof of a
BMW?

32:39.257 --> 32:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the daughter of a former
general, a former general whose
state salary was never

32:42.460 --> 32:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than 45,000 U.S. dollars.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This man is the stepson of
another South Sudanese general.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.237 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
He calls himself
the young tycoon.

32:52.237 --> 32:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His Facebook photos show a life
of privilege unimaginable to
most South Sudanese.

32:57.542 --> 33:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, he narrates a tour of a
presidential suite at a luxury
hotel in Las Vegas.

33:02.781 --> 33:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST, Founding
Director, The Enough Project:
So, it's like a mafia in some
ways.

33:07.352 --> 33:11.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A mafia has taken
over the state.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: John Prendergast is
the director of the Enough
Project, a rights group that

33:13.892 --> 33:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
oversees The Sentry group.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: The mafia we
see in the movies, that is
shooting a few people.

33:20.198 --> 33:26.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In South Sudan, tens of
thousands of people have died in
this war, with horrific
atrocities,

33:26.404 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mass rape, child soldier
recruitment., all the worst of
the worst of the human rights

33:31.209 --> 33:33.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
abuses that we hear
about globally.

33:33.545 --> 33:37.282 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And this is how
they stay in power.

33:37.282 --> 33:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Prendergast says
much of the corruption happens
through government contracts
granted

33:40.585 --> 33:43.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the family members of
political and military leaders.

33:43.755 --> 33:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: They put their
family members as share owners
of the companies, and then

33:48.326 --> 33:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they gets, contracts from the
state to allow those companies
to operate.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's a backdoor way out of
the national treasury to
privately enrich yourself and

33:59.971 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your family.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Meanwhile, the war
helps the rich get richer.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: If you control
the government institutions,
well, you have access to the

34:07.212 --> 34:08.847 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
army.

34:08.847 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have access to
the state budget.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can buy weapons.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.184 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You can steal as
much as you want.

34:13.184 --> 34:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can issue contracts to your
own company that you have set
up.

34:17.589 --> 34:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's in the context of war that
a certain group of people become
fabulously wealthy,

34:23.328 --> 34:26.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
while the rest of the
country is immiserated.

34:26.364 --> 34:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: As a result, two
bitter enemies, President Kiir
and his rival, Riek Machar,

34:31.703 --> 34:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own luxury villas just a short
distance from one another in the
exclusive Lavington neighborhood

34:36.374 --> 34:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Nairobi, Kenya, all made
possible by international
enablers, says Prendergast.

34:41.546 --> 34:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: Bankers, and
businessmen, arms dealers, all
kinds of different lawyers,

34:46.151 --> 34:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shipping agents, accountants.

34:49.220 --> 34:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a number of different
professions that are gladly at
the service of dictators

34:56.461 --> 34:59.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and war criminals, because
they pay an extra premium.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Clooney, Cheadle and
Prendergast came to the White
House this afternoon for

35:01.566 --> 35:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a meeting with President Obama.

35:04.235 --> 35:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want the president to sign
an executive order targeting the
international assets of

35:07.138 --> 35:10.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
South Sudan's leaders.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Such an order would make it
difficult for these leaders to
access the international

35:13.111 --> 35:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banking system, move cash, buy
property and do business across
borders.

35:17.849 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: If we were
able to create that standard
over time, where real
consequences

35:24.289 --> 35:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would accrue to people who would
be willing to kill by the
thousands to stay in power

35:31.196 --> 35:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or to gain power, it would have
a -- I believe, a chilling
effect on mass atrocities being

35:37.369 --> 35:39.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
committed in the future.

35:39.337 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: South Sudan's
leaders keep their money
offshore.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That makes them vulnerable.

35:44.709 --> 35:50.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: Because they
have this vulnerability of
offshoring their assets, we can
use existing

35:50.548 --> 35:54.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy tools to go
after that money.

35:54.019 --> 35:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: It's a strategy
that's been used to target
terrorists post-9/11.

35:57.055 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PRENDERGAST: We got to
raise the cost of doing business
with war criminals.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Corrupt leaders of
war-torn countries are nothing
new.

36:04.829 --> 36:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But applying this strategy
to isolate them is new.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It might be a way to begin
holding these mass killers
responsible for their actions.

36:12.370 --> 36:20.445 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
P.J. Tobia, "PBS
NewsHour," in Washington.

36:20.445 --> 36:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we begin a
special week-long look at the
ways that some schools,
educators

36:33.224 --> 36:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and leaders are trying to
transform higher education.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The goal?

36:37.328 --> 36:40.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To prepare students for
the modern work force.

36:40.532 --> 36:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The series is called Rethinking
College, part of PBS' Spotlight
Education initiative, which

36:45.603 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
features special programming
examining today's challenges.

36:49.407 --> 36:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Hari Sreenivasan visits
Dallas, where an innovative
college president is growing

36:54.045 --> 36:57.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a new kind of student.

36:57.315 --> 37:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At a Texas
college, a football field that
was turned into a farm.

37:02.754 --> 37:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We need to harvest about
10 pounds of radishes.

37:06.091 --> 37:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Tigers of
Paul Quinn College lost more
football games than they

37:09.227 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won on this field.

37:11.729 --> 37:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, nine years ago, when the
historically black college on
the South Side of Dallas

37:16.434 --> 37:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was in financial crisis and had
a 1 percent graduation rate, a
new president turned everything

37:22.240 --> 37:25.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over, including the
football field.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, did you envision this when
you first saw the football field
and the...

37:29.280 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL, President,
Paul Quinn College: No, no.

37:31.382 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Sorrell had no experience
running a college.

37:34.752 --> 37:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had been a lawyer and White
House special assistant, but he
knew Paul Quinn couldn't

37:38.223 --> 37:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
afford a football program.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: There's more
than one field of dreams, all
right?

37:44.028 --> 37:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why should we tie everyone's
future to athletic success?

37:48.933 --> 37:53.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He turned the
football field into an organic
farm that generates more than

37:53.838 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
20,000 pounds of organic
vegetables every year, veggies
that make it into high-end
restaurants

37:58.977 --> 38:01.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and into the Dallas
Cowboys' stadium.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SORRELL: I think
this has saved our school.

38:04.149 --> 38:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It saved it because it changed
the narrative of the
institution.

38:07.485 --> 38:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The farm has
become a symbol for a remade
Paul Quinn College.

38:11.389 --> 38:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: We're the first
urban work college in the
country.

38:15.293 --> 38:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so our students learn what
it means to be effective and to
have job skills and work

38:20.031 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
skills.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VINCENT OWOSENI, Student: The
app that records our work
college hours is called UAttend
(ph).

38:24.736 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Students are
assigned jobs from day one.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VINCENT OWOSENI: So when I punch
in, the dean of work college
should be able to track that

38:31.876 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I punched in.

38:33.711 --> 38:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now it's recorded that
I'm punched into work.

38:36.481 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every student here has to work
150 hours to fulfill their work
tuition.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES HUNTER, Farm Manager, Paul
Quinn College: Our goal is for
them to be somewhere between

38:43.855 --> 38:46.324 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
nickel size to
quarter size around.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James
Hunter is the farm manager.

38:49.527 --> 38:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES HUNTER: Most of the
students that work on the farm,
they're not going to be farmers,

38:52.430 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and I don't want
them to be farmers.

38:54.032 --> 38:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want them to pursue whatever
they're interested in.

38:57.635 --> 39:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vincent
Owoseni is a business management
major.

39:01.406 --> 39:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VINCENT OWOSENI: One basic
principle about the farm is
supply and demand.

39:05.710 --> 39:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's say if a plant is going to
be in demand around Thanksgiving
time, around November,

39:10.848 --> 39:14.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're going to plant
that late summertime.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It helps you to understand the
bigger picture of the farm,
knowing about the customer,
knowing

39:17.288 --> 39:19.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the economy of the farm.

39:19.991 --> 39:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES HUNTER: So, Vincent, for
instance, but we want to focus
more on how to read financials

39:25.029 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a balance sheet, what it
takes when you're planning
expenses or long-term revenue
strategy.

39:31.369 --> 39:36.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Unless
students are on the farm, they
wear business attire, or face a

39:36.941 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
steep fine.

39:39.310 --> 39:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: You want to run
back and get your dress shoes,
so that you can not

39:45.883 --> 39:47.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get fined?

39:47.752 --> 39:50.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
What's the fine?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: So, there's
two ways to handle the fine.

39:52.690 --> 39:58.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can either do 400
prayer squats or pay $200.

39:58.263 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Four hundred
prayer squats for being out of
dress code?

40:02.934 --> 40:06.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: It's better
than paying the fine.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eighty-three percent of our
students are Pell
Grant-eligible, which means, by
and large,

40:09.674 --> 40:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that their families have a
dysfunctional relationship with
wealth and with work.

40:14.145 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you have never been in an
environment where you have come
to understand the expectations

40:18.616 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a career, because all you
have ever seen is people be
underemployed or unemployed,

40:21.986 --> 40:24.255 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
then how are you
going to learn that?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER MORENO, Student:
Good morning, everyone.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Jennifer Moreno.

40:26.491 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm a freshman.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm from Ennis, Texas.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For their
first two years, Paul Quinn
students are assigned on-campus

40:32.997 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jobs often ones that require
contact with the public.

40:37.035 --> 40:40.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The idea is to improve
communication and
problem-solving skills.

40:40.405 --> 40:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: Our students
are getting two forms of
education.

40:43.408 --> 40:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're getting a rigorous
liberal arts training, and
they're also getting real world
work experience.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But students
are not directly paid for their
work.

40:51.149 --> 40:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, earnings go to the
college to pay down their
tuition.

40:54.252 --> 40:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: This is where all
your classes will be held.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Freshman
Jennifer Moreno is a
first-generation student whose
parents

40:59.724 --> 41:01.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are from Mexico.

41:01.659 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER MORENO: With the work
program, they give you $5,000.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That goes toward your tuition.

41:07.332 --> 41:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coming from a low-income family,
this was a great option.

41:11.869 --> 41:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: The students
might spend their first two
years working on-campus, as

41:16.007 --> 41:19.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we make sure that they're
properly prepared to be
successful.

41:19.744 --> 41:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, the last two years,
they're working off-campus in
companies or other businesses

41:24.248 --> 41:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are related to their
career aspirations.

41:27.652 --> 41:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senior Destiny
Modeste is interning at
Slingshot, an advertising agency

41:32.623 --> 41:35.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in downtown Dallas.

41:35.493 --> 41:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her employer pays Paul Quinn
College $7,500 per school year
for Destiny's work.

41:40.832 --> 41:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESTINY MODESTE, Student: Having
the opportunity to work and help
pay your tuition at the same

41:45.069 --> 41:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time at an actual agency and see
what they do on a daily basis,
and then maybe, at the

41:50.007 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
end, they offered a job,
that's very important to me.

41:53.244 --> 42:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: There is no
employment training program that
will cost as little as $15,000.

42:00.051 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is an investment in
improving the talent pool of
your company and your office.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So what's the
incentive for an employer to
keep that student around?

42:07.492 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: Well, don't
keep them around if they aren't
good enough, right?

42:11.396 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our responsibility to them is
provide a quality product.

42:15.900 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris
Hawthorne, who runs the intern
program at Slingshot, says the

42:20.471 --> 42:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
partnership with an historically
black college is important.

42:24.175 --> 42:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS HAWTHORNE, Slingshot: We
have, as an industry, in
advertising, struggled with
attracting

42:26.978 --> 42:29.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
minorities to the
field of advertising.

42:29.313 --> 42:32.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we started this
relationship with Paul Quinn.

42:32.216 --> 42:35.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We met Destiny, and
she was fantastic.

42:35.052 --> 42:39.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But as
important as career and college
are to Sorrell's vision, he also

42:39.223 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pushes his students to
engage in community service.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: We believe that
colleges have a fundamental
responsibility, if you're

42:47.031 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
located in an urban area, to
turn outward and address the
needs of the communities you

42:50.101 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
serve.

42:51.335 --> 42:53.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are in a food desert.

42:53.438 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no grocery
store for four miles.

42:56.441 --> 42:57.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

42:57.675 --> 42:59.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's real.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People don't have
access to healthy food.

43:01.946 --> 43:05.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean affordable, fresh
and healthy produce.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We decided we have the ability
to solve the problem, and we're
going to go solve the problem.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that what
people come to college to learn?

43:10.621 --> 43:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SORRELL: Someone's going
to figure out the urban issues.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why shouldn't it be the people
who came from those urban
communities that have a vested

43:16.861 --> 43:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interest in those neighborhoods?

43:20.465 --> 43:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In keeping
with that mission, the college
donates 10 percent of the
produce

43:23.501 --> 43:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the farm, named WE over Me,
to the surrounding underserved
community.

43:27.905 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VINCENT OWOSENI: If you look at
the need around you, and you
look at your resource, you can,

43:31.309 --> 43:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, hey, I can use this space
right here to grow what my
community needs.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Where someone else sees
hopelessness, you see an
opportunity.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Dallas, for
the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, tomorrow,
Hari's series continues with the
particular financial and
cultural

43:48.793 --> 43:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenges Latino males face
when it comes to earning a
degree.

43:53.164 --> 43:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And online: While students have
asked colleges and universities
to do better in hiring more

43:57.735 --> 44:01.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
professors of color,
institutions have struggled to
live up to their pledges.

44:01.606 --> 44:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our partners at The Hechinger
Report explore why.

44:05.243 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we return to our coverage of the
15th anniversary of

44:10.081 --> 44:14.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the September 11 attacks
and the aftermath.

44:14.151 --> 44:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A decade-and-a-half after the
U.S. invasion, Afghanistan is
still rebuilding and heavily

44:20.424 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dependent on international aid,
relying on other countries for
70 percent of its government

44:24.595 --> 44:26.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
budget.

44:26.564 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still, Afghanistan is taking
steps to stand on its own.

44:31.269 --> 44:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One project on the outskirts of
Kabul is both a symbol of the
effort to rebuild the country

44:35.907 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a potent reminder
of national pride.

44:39.076 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Jennifer Glasse reports.

44:42.713 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Mohammad Kabir
has lived in the shadow of the
Darul Aman Palace all

44:46.617 --> 44:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his life through years of
peace and decades of war.

44:52.924 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
King Amanullah Khan commissioned
the building of the Neoclassical
palace in the early 1920s,

44:57.628 --> 45:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a symbol of a modern,
progressive, independent
Afghanistan.

45:02.333 --> 45:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took just over two years to
build and the king lived here
about as long, before he was

45:06.070 --> 45:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
driven into exile in 1929
by a popular uprising.

45:10.875 --> 45:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kabir, who says he's about 100,
used to play with the king's
children, then tended the

45:16.147 --> 45:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
palace garden for most of his
adult life, until the mujahideen
war that followed the

45:20.051 --> 45:24.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
1989 Soviet retreat
drove him away.

45:24.088 --> 45:27.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He returned four years ago, and
says it's a lot different than
when it stood in its

45:27.725 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
glory.

45:30.528 --> 45:34.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD KABIR, Afghanistan
(through translator): Back then,
the garden was full of fruit
trees

45:34.432 --> 45:37.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and covered with grass.

45:37.301 --> 45:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Families came to picnic, listen
to music, and camp overnight.

45:41.906 --> 45:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: A corner of the
gardens has been partially
restored, and there are grand

45:45.509 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plans for it and the
rest of the palace.

45:48.879 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2010, a professor and former
World Bank official named Ashraf
Ghani wrote that Darul

45:54.051 --> 45:57.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Aman was a palace of
abandoned dreams.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he is president, and trying
to make it the stuff of dreams
with an all-Afghan project

46:00.891 --> 46:04.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to restore it.

46:04.495 --> 46:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For three months, hundreds of
laborers have been taking down
ceilings, and carting out

46:07.198 --> 46:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rubble to make the
building safe.

46:09.700 --> 46:15.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That process could take
until the end of the year.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Architect Zabiullah
Suleimankhail is one of the
100-strong technical team that's
mapping

46:18.476 --> 46:19.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out the reconstruction.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been a lot of research.

46:22.380 --> 46:25.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ZABIULLAH SULEIMANKHAIL,
Architect: The bricks they have
used to build the palace had the

46:25.683 --> 46:27.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mark on them.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The mark
of the king, he says.

46:29.954 --> 46:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is proud that the workers
here and the funds to pay for it
are all Afghan.

46:35.159 --> 46:38.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says this project is a source
of national pride that shows
that Afghans can work on

46:38.462 --> 46:41.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their own.

46:41.032 --> 46:46.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZABIULLAH SULEIMANKHAIL: When
you're looking to the palace,
you're envisioning about or

46:46.804 --> 46:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're thinking about the
decades of war that Afghanistan
was faced with.

46:54.011 --> 47:02.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, when you want to build
or reconstruct this building,
it's really a point to great

47:02.219 --> 47:05.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and brighter future.

47:05.289 --> 47:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The building
also points to an ambitious
past, like the grand room

47:09.093 --> 47:12.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
built by the king to house
the new parliament.

47:12.496 --> 47:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wanted the Darul Aman Palace,
which means Abode of Peace, to
be the center of a new

47:15.833 --> 47:17.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

47:17.535 --> 47:21.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was deposed before he
could make that happen.

47:21.238 --> 47:23.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Ghani is using the
rebuilding process to reflect
his own view of what Afghanistan

47:23.507 --> 47:25.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
should be.

47:25.943 --> 47:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So a quarter of the technical
staff are women, like structural
engineer Sofia Roshan.

47:30.448 --> 47:33.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's her first job
out of college.

47:33.384 --> 47:37.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOFIA ROSHAN, Structural
Engineer: It's very difficult
for -- especially for girls of
Afghanistan

47:37.321 --> 47:42.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work as a structural engineer
or architectural engineer on the
big projects of Afghanistan,

47:42.626 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
especially palace.

47:45.162 --> 47:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's that's a good
opportunity for us to work with
them and show the world that,

47:50.935 --> 47:53.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yes, we can do it.

47:53.370 --> 47:57.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: They're hoping
to complete this in three to
five years at an estimated

47:57.274 --> 48:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost right now of around $30
million, though planners say
costs could go 10 percent higher

48:02.413 --> 48:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or more, depending on how much
structural damage is discovered.

48:06.751 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't the first time that
Afghans have tried to restore
this palace.

48:10.254 --> 48:14.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About four years ago, the mayor
of Kabul launched a campaign and
called on Afghans to donate

48:14.291 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whatever they could, from as
little as 20 cents to hundreds
of dollars.

48:18.629 --> 48:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thousands of Afghans did,
but nobody knows where that
money went.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lack of accountability has
fueled corruption for years
here.

48:26.937 --> 48:30.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Transparency International rates
Afghanistan one of world's worst
corruption offenders.

48:30.374 --> 48:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The head of Kabul's exchange
market says it is as big as
threat as the Taliban.

48:36.480 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Inside
the government, we have some
criminals and warlords who are

48:40.951 --> 48:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always fighting to keep their
influence on the nation and
government.

48:44.188 --> 48:47.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they use illegal
ways to stay in power.

48:47.124 --> 48:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They only care about their own
profits, not what benefits the
people or the government.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Afghanistan's
finance minister says the
government is aware of the
problem

48:54.999 --> 48:57.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and doing what it can.

48:57.568 --> 49:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EKLIL AHMAD HAKIMI, Minister of
Finance: I have identified at
least 20 very corrupt
individuals

49:02.306 --> 49:04.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within my ministry.

49:04.008 --> 49:07.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I just fired them.

49:07.645 --> 49:12.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Unfortunately, I regret
now why I fired them.

49:12.449 --> 49:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should have put them in a jail
or in a detention center to
recover the stolen public money.

49:19.423 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I regret, up to now, we
don't have this kind of system.

49:24.161 --> 49:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: He hopes a new
anti-corruption justice center
will fill that gap.

49:30.835 --> 49:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Afghan government is trying
to support fruit and vegetable
sales and export.

49:35.105 --> 49:38.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighty percent of the population
is involved in agriculture, but
few make more than a subsistence

49:38.809 --> 49:42.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
living.

49:42.046 --> 49:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the same problem about 100
miles north of the capital in
the Panjshir Valley, lots

49:45.516 --> 49:50.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of promise, but not much
support realizing it.

49:50.821 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deep inside a hillside, these
miners are hoping to strike it
rich.

49:54.058 --> 49:56.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're looking for emeralds.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a basic operation.

49:59.463 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pretty much everything is done
by hand, except for the blasts
that help carve out the tunnels.

50:04.001 --> 50:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The dangers are considerable,
but so are the rewards.

50:07.638 --> 50:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One group recently found an
emerald that sold for $80,000.

50:11.175 --> 50:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Panjshir isn't the only place in
Afghanistan with possibilities
for mining.

50:16.113 --> 50:18.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are metals, minerals and
gems all over the country that
could bring the government

50:18.916 --> 50:21.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
billions of dollars.

50:21.719 --> 50:24.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in many cases, they don't
have the resources to get them
out of the ground or the
infrastructure

50:24.688 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take them to market.

50:28.626 --> 50:33.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last Wednesday in Western
Afghanistan, Afghan and Iranian
officials came together to
inaugurate

50:33.330 --> 50:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a key step in building that
infrastructure, the first link
in a railway that eventually

50:37.368 --> 50:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will connect the Iranian seaport
of Chabahar to landlocked
Afghanistan.

50:41.939 --> 50:46.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This project has already
been delayed by seven years.

50:46.577 --> 50:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghans will be watching closely
to see whether this train line
to connect Afghanistan with

50:50.948 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the wider world and reduce its
dependency on exporting through
Pakistan will really

50:54.018 --> 50:59.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be built.

50:59.456 --> 51:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back at the palace, there's no
doubt that this project will be
completed.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say the president is
keeping close track of it.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they can't wait for
it to be finished.

51:07.598 --> 51:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZABIULLAH SULEIMANKHAIL: I'm
really just looking forward to
that day, that a day will come

51:13.671 --> 51:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we will face the palace,
and we will cut the ribbon, and
we will inaugurate the

51:17.875 --> 51:19.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

51:19.576 --> 51:22.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That will be the best
of my -- our life.

51:22.813 --> 51:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: If that day
does come, then a new Afghan
leader will have renewed the

51:26.717 --> 51:31.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dream of a king who, a century
ago, wanted to show the world a
modern independent Afghanistan.

51:31.689 --> 51:39.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jennifer Glasse in Kabul.

51:39.229 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "Charlie Rose"
tonight: President Bill Clinton
weighs in on the Clinton

51:50.474 --> 51:54.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
foundation and questions
about his wife's health.

51:54.445 --> 51:57.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The former president says she
stumbled because she was
dehydrated and that it's nothing
more

51:57.881 --> 52:00.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
serious.

52:00.417 --> 52:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says it has happened before
when she's become dehydrated and
that he doesn't think

52:03.921 --> 52:08.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will be able to keep her from
campaigning for more than
another day.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.761 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

52:10.761 --> 52:15.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, correspondent John
Yang checks in with the first of
two reports from the

52:15.699 --> 52:18.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crucial battleground
state of Ohio.

52:18.035 --> 52:19.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:19.203 --> 52:20.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:20.637 --> 52:24.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Join us online and again
here tomorrow evening.

52:24.041 --> 52:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
