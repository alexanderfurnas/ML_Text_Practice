JUDY WOODRUFF: Aside from the
many international issues before
President Trump this week, his

00:05.033 --> 00:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first major push on domestic
policy is facing an uphill
climb in the Senate.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has this checkup.

00:12.966 --> 00:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: When last we left
the saga of the Republicans'
attempt to repeal and replace

00:19.233 --> 00:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act,
Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell didn't have
the votes for the Senate

00:22.300 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, so lawmakers headed home
for the Fourth of July recess.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where do things stand
as the recess ends?

00:28.366 --> 00:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's turn to our
own Lisa Desjardins.

00:30.433 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, has this week off
helped or hurt McConnell's
efforts to get this bill passed?

00:36.933 --> 00:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It has not
helped, and that has hurt.

00:39.366 --> 00:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see some Republicans who
are not usually in the middle
of these situations, like John

00:43.000 --> 00:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hoeven of North Dakota, for
example, meeting not just with
constituents, but with hospital

00:47.666 --> 00:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administrators, those
kinds of people.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he came away with those
meetings having, stressing
problems with the bill.

00:53.066 --> 00:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, yesterday, Mitch
McConnell, the majority
leader, spoke to a
rotary club in Kentucky.

01:00.566 --> 01:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said this quote that
got a lot of attention:
"If my side is unable
to agree on an adequate

01:05.033 --> 01:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
replacement, then some kind
of action with regard to the
private health insurance market

01:07.833 --> 01:09.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
must occur.

01:09.466 --> 01:11.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
No action is not
an alternative."

01:11.866 --> 01:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His office insists he said
things like this before,
but the timing is key.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a bill that was
supposed to be voted on already.

01:18.733 --> 01:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John, leadership sources tell
me they would still like a new
revised bill next week, maybe

01:22.633 --> 01:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a vote the following week.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that seems unclear now
if it will really happen.

01:26.933 --> 01:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Seems like Mitch
McConnell was sending a message.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, who are the key players that
he was sending that message to?

01:33.200 --> 01:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: You
got it exactly right.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We talked so much
about moderates before.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now it's all about
the conservatives.

01:38.133 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was saying to conservatives,
we have to revise these bills,
or we have lost our shot

01:41.933 --> 01:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of having anything
as Republicans.

01:43.966 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's compare two conservatives
who spoke in town halls
yesterday's sound bites, first

01:49.866 --> 01:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: 2010,
2014, and 2016, repealing
Obamacare was front and center.

01:58.866 --> 02:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I recognize that some folks
may not agree with that, but
the voters, repealing Obamacare

02:06.000 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the single biggest factor
producing a Republican House,
a Republican Senate, and

02:10.266 --> 02:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think ultimately a
Republican president.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, that's
an animated Ted Cruz.

02:14.433 --> 02:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is trying to change this
revised bill to try and get
it across the finish line.

02:18.633 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But compare that with
Kansas Senator Jerry Moran.

02:21.066 --> 02:23.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:23.100 --> 02:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JERRY MORAN (R),
Kansas: I believe in the
legislative process that
allows public debate,

02:28.800 --> 02:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
public discussions,
testimony, amendments
offered by all senators.

02:35.766 --> 02:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill comes to the Senate
floor, amendments offered by all
senators, and figure out where

02:41.000 --> 02:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are 60 votes to pass
something that is so important
to so many Americans.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: How about
that key number, 60 votes?

02:49.966 --> 02:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means Democrats would
need to be to be involved.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's coming
from a conservative.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So, what
are the options?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can Mitch McConnell try
to do to get the votes he needs
to pass a bill in the Senate?

03:01.966 --> 03:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There are no
easy options left, but there
are three options that seem

03:03.500 --> 03:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to define the possible paths
right now for Mr. McConnell.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first is to revise the bill.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what we have
been talking about.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They do hope to offer
a revised bill soon.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But can it get enough votes?

03:14.166 --> 03:15.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Unclear.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The second is a full repeal.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's something Rand
Paul and Ted Cruz want.

03:19.566 --> 03:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, with that full repeal
would come a replacement later.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And many of my sources
in the Republican Party
say that is too risky.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's also an
option that the president
raised last week.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's correct.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this doesn't seem
to have the votes right
now in the Senate.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then the third option would be
smaller fixes to the Affordable
Care Act, something that

03:35.300 --> 03:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stabilizes the market
and fixes what people
think are problems now.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That would involve
the Democrats as well.

03:40.866 --> 03:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That would keep ACA
essentially as it this, just
make little nicks and cuts

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the edges.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Potentially.

03:46.933 --> 03:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be a much smaller
bill at that point.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's what
the Democrats want.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, as we sit here,
with the Senate about to come
back next week, what are the

03:54.233 --> 03:55.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
odds?

03:55.233 --> 03:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are the chances?

03:57.266 --> 04:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does your gut tell you
about the chances of, A, the
Senate passing something and, if

04:01.133 --> 04:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happens, B, getting
something to the president's
desk for his signature?

04:03.933 --> 04:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I have
the sense that almost no one
knows exactly what's going to

04:06.666 --> 04:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen now, but I would say,
given that and given the way
the Senate works, the odds are

04:10.333 --> 04:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long, both on a bill passing
the Senate and even longer on
it getting to the president's

04:13.933 --> 04:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
desk, as things stand right now.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the odds are
good you're going to have a busy
week next week, when the Senate

04:18.366 --> 04:19.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes back.

04:19.366 --> 04:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think so.

04:20.366 --> 04:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks, Lisa.
