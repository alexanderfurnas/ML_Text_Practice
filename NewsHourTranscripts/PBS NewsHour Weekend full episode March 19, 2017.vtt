09:10.733 --> 09:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A

18:29.567 --> 18:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVER LIVED.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COMES FROM A PERSON WHO

18:32.133 --> 18:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT

18:33.433 --> 18:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITING.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IN THE END THERE WERE SO

18:36.200 --> 18:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY THINGS THAT CHUCK BERRY DID

18:38.233 --> 18:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WERE REVOLUTIONARY.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS THE SONG

18:41.367 --> 18:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITING I THINK THAT PERSEVERES,

18:45.433 --> 18:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WILL STAND ABOVE ALL.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS EYE FOR DETAIL, HIS EAR FOR

18:49.600 --> 18:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANGUAGE.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY THAT HE PUT WORDS AND

18:52.533 --> 18:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHRASES TOGETHER.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW BOB DYLAN CALLED HIM

18:56.800 --> 18:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SHAKESPEARE OF ROCK 'N'

18:58.200 --> 18:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLL.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AGAIN, HIGH

19:00.100 --> 19:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRAISE FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS A

19:01.467 --> 19:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEW --

19:02.100 --> 19:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> A THING OR TWO.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY LESSONS HE LEARNED FROM

19:07.200 --> 19:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHUCK BERRY.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS IN THE STUPID THROW

19:11.367 --> 19:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY TEENAGE MUSIC.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAD THAT SPIRIT AND THAT

19:15.100 --> 19:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREEDOM BUT IT ALSO HAD A DEPTH

19:17.133 --> 19:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A RESONANCE, THAT'S THE

19:19.100 --> 19:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASON THESE SONGS SUSTAINED 50,

19:21.033 --> 19:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
60 YEARS LATER.

19:21.700 --> 19:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND HE BROUGHT

19:25.800 --> 19:27.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CERTAIN ATTITUDE TO THE TABLE

19:27.067 --> 19:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WELL.

19:27.733 --> 19:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS UNAPOLOGETIC.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS A SHOWMAN, A PERFORMER,

19:33.600 --> 19:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEBODY WHO WAS A PROUD BLACK

19:35.433 --> 19:37.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN AT A TIME WHEN THAT WAS A

19:37.667 --> 19:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGING THING TO BE.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MAINSTREAM ENTERTAINMENT.

19:41.367 --> 19:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO COULD WRITE A SONG LIKE

19:43.700 --> 19:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN EYED HANDSOME MAN THAT WAS

19:46.733 --> 19:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE BIT CODED BUT NOT THAT

19:48.533 --> 19:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CODED IN SPEAKING ABOUT, YOU

19:51.500 --> 19:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, RACIAL DIVISIONS AND

19:53.167 --> 19:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFINITIES IN THIS COUNTRY.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HE WAS ALSO

19:56.067 --> 19:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY SAVVY IN MARKETING HIS

19:59.267 --> 20:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUSIC REALLY EARLY ON GIVING

20:02.100 --> 20:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CO-WRITING CREDITS.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE PICKED UP EARLY ON HE WAS

20:05.800 --> 20:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING BURNED BY THE WAY THINGS

20:08.867 --> 20:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE BEING HANDLED.

20:13.533 --> 20:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBELLINE WAS HIS FIRST WRITING

20:16.567 --> 20:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREDIT.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SONG WRITING WAS GIVEN TO

20:18.800 --> 20:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM AND ALAN FREED, AND THE GUY

20:22.533 --> 20:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO THE RECORD LABEL OWNER OWED

20:25.967 --> 20:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FAVOR TO.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HIS FIRST HIT HE WAS

20:29.033 --> 20:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECEIVING A THIRD OF THE

20:30.167 --> 20:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCEEDS.

20:30.733 --> 20:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL YOU KNOW, CHUCK BERRY

20:32.267 --> 20:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T SUFFER FOOLS MUCH.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WENT INTO A VERY DEFENSIVE

20:37.533 --> 20:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS POSTURE FROM THERE,

20:39.233 --> 20:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO INSISTED

20:41.767 --> 20:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON FULL CASH PAYMENT IN HIS HAND

20:43.200 --> 20:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE HE WOULD GO ON A STAGE.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMOUSLY WOULD SHOW UP FOR A

20:45.233 --> 20:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIG, GO INTO THE OFFICE, COUNT

20:48.533 --> 20:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAND PICK UP THE GUITAR GO ON

STAGE BUT NOT BEFORE THEN.

20:54.933 --> 20:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE REALLY ORGANIZED A CAREER

20:56.667 --> 20:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS SORT OF BASED ON

20:57.733 --> 21:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUSTING NO ONE AND HAVING SEEN

21:03.133 --> 21:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EFFECTS OF ILLICIT OR AT

21:06.833 --> 21:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS

21:08.567 --> 21:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTICES EARLY ON.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT REALLY SHAPED THE WAY

21:11.700 --> 21:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE APPROACHED HIS CAREER MOVING

21:12.800 --> 21:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORWARD.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
