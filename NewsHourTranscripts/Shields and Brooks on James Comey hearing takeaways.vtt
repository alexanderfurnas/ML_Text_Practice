JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.433 --> 00:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:09.566 --> 00:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's continue the
conversation about James Comey.

00:12.866 --> 00:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, we heard today what
the president thinks of it.

00:15.966 --> 00:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he thought the former
FBI director vindicated him,
but he also was telling lies.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you think?

00:23.166 --> 00:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought Trump
actually had some points.

00:25.233 --> 00:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the things we
heard on the criminal side, it
wasn't a bad, not a terrible

00:29.333 --> 00:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
day for Donald Trump.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Comey seemed to suggest
that there was no -- maybe --
cast some doubt at least the

00:36.133 --> 00:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
idea there was a lot
of collusion between
the Russian government
and the Trump campaign

00:39.666 --> 00:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or even a lot of conversations.

00:41.766 --> 00:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what Trump did to James
Comey, clearing the room and
asking him to lay off on Flynn,

00:48.533 --> 00:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was scandalous, I think
terrible, but probably
not something that
would rise to the level

00:51.733 --> 00:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of impeachment in any
normal presidency.

00:53.933 --> 00:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to me, on the criminal
front, not a disastrous
testimony for Donald Trump.

01:00.466 --> 01:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the cultural front, on the
moral front, kind of disastrous.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The thought that he
lied is pretty strong.

01:05.733 --> 01:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do know, because of
what Comey said yesterday,
there's going to be a
lot more investigations.

01:10.066 --> 01:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And every time there's
some sort of independent
or special investigation
into the White House,

01:14.333 --> 01:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it can swallow a White
House up not only for
months, but for years.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Whitewater investigation
went on for seven years.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think what's going
to happen is, you are going to
have a continued administration

01:25.100 --> 01:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's dysfunctional, that
is under investigation,
that is distrustful,
and a president who's

01:29.933 --> 01:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obsessed, not with policy, not
with anything constructive,
but with this sort of warfare.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did
you make of James Comey
and what he had to say?

01:37.366 --> 01:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I thought
James Comey was believable.

01:39.766 --> 01:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought he was compelling,
in large part because,
Judy, he admitted his flaws.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He did not present
himself as Galahad or
some profile in courage.

01:48.333 --> 01:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He acknowledged the fact that
the pressure of being one-on-one
with the president just

01:53.166 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House, that he
had not said to the president
it was inappropriate.

01:57.866 --> 02:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said he hadn't
been strong enough.

02:00.633 --> 02:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what was most revealing
to me of all the hearings,
Republicans -- and I do want the

02:06.633 --> 02:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say one word to the senators.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, they didn't
do soliloquies.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't do seven-minute
statements followed by a
question, do you agree?

02:14.566 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought -- and they didn't
show rank partisanship,
I felt, and that there
was a seriousness led

02:21.066 --> 02:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by Chairman Burr
and Co-Chair Warner.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what impressed me most of
all was that, while Republican
senators were willing to

02:32.000 --> 02:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come to the defense of the
president, a point David made,
that there wasn't obstruction

02:34.966 --> 02:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of justice on his part
or whatever, none of
them challenged Director
Comey's direct statements

02:42.033 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president lied and that
he was a liar, and that that
is why he had to memorialize

02:48.600 --> 02:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each meeting with the
president, each conversation
with the president,
because he feared that

02:51.333 --> 02:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president would lie.

02:53.033 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And nobody said, no,
wait a minute, this
is George Washington.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man, a total --
he does have a reputation
for exaggeration, hyping,
and some would say

03:04.500 --> 03:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not a totally consistent
relationship with the
truth and reality.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's a
real problem for him.

03:11.433 --> 03:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact he wasn't under
investigation is significant,
but, ironically, nobody asked

03:18.366 --> 03:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, and Director Comey didn't
volunteer, whether, as a
consequence of what happened

03:21.333 --> 03:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his meetings at the
White House, that he may
now have opened himself
up to some investigation,

03:25.466 --> 03:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he, the president.

03:26.466 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as we reported earlier,
David, the president said today
he sure -- he would be glad to

03:32.500 --> 03:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or would be willing to speak
under oath to the special
counsel, Robert Mueller, about

03:39.633 --> 03:41.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what happened.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But given what you and Mark are
saying, does Comey now come out
with his credibility intact?

03:47.300 --> 03:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's a careful witness.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was a very believable
witness, as Mark said.

03:54.333 --> 03:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think what we saw
in the Comey testimony was
really a clash of cultures.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
James Comey is an
institutional man.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He serves the FBI.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He believes in a
government of laws.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believes in following the
procedures and norms that
really govern any organization.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are a nation of laws.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump lives in
an entirely different
cultural universe.

04:14.700 --> 04:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is more clannist,
believing in clan, believing
in family, believing in
loyalty, not recognizing

04:21.700 --> 04:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
objective law, not recognizing
the procedures that is really
how modern government operates.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when Paul Ryan and other
Republicans say, well, Donald
Trump just didn't know the rules

04:32.100 --> 04:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because he's an innocent
at this, he's a newbie at
this, that's insufficient.

04:37.100 --> 04:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not only that he doesn't
know the rules, but at all along
and throughout his presidency,

04:41.266 --> 04:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he has sort of trampled
on the rules almost as
a matter of policy, as
a matter of character,

04:47.700 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he doesn't believe in
that kind of relationships.

04:49.333 --> 04:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's all personal
loyalty, not about laws
and norms and standards.

04:53.366 --> 04:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think, eventually,
down the road, that is going
to be a continual source of

04:57.266 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem for him, that he's
continually violating the
way we do our government.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
Mark, what about the
-- David brought it up.

05:04.433 --> 05:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan said --
essentially gives the president
a pass, saying, well, he's new

05:08.366 --> 05:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Washington, doesn't know
how government works, he's
not a man of government.

05:11.833 --> 05:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, he's an
enormous child, and we just --
we don't have the same rules

05:17.300 --> 05:18.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him.

05:18.333 --> 05:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was less than fatuous.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was dishonest and misleading
on the part of the speaker.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you cannot say that.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This man has been
running for president.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is president.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have any -- he is a
graduate of Wharton, although I
would like to see the director

05:35.266 --> 05:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of admissions at some point
come forward and explain his
knowledge of American government

05:40.100 --> 05:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from his experience at the
University of Pennsylvania.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you can't use these
kind of excuses, Judy.

05:47.100 --> 05:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just picking up on what David
was saying, what is fascinating
about the Comey testimony,

05:54.033 --> 05:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you listened to it -- I
listened to every word of it --
is that Donald Trump -- David

05:58.433 --> 06:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mentions loyalty.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Loyalty to Donald
Trump is one way.

06:02.233 --> 06:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every one of the co-authors
who has worked with him on
any of his books has agreed on

06:06.200 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one thing.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is a man without any friends.

06:08.866 --> 06:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could not name a friend.

06:10.900 --> 06:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one person that he's shown
any sense of loyalty to --
he shows none to the people

06:16.700 --> 06:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around him -- is
General Mike Flynn.

06:19.666 --> 06:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's curious.

06:21.433 --> 06:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is it about
that relationship?

06:24.100 --> 06:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was it that Mike Flynn
did or was doing or that Donald
Trump is concerned that he

06:30.100 --> 06:32.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might say?

06:32.566 --> 06:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, in the course
of the conversation,
other satellites,
referring to people who

06:35.400 --> 06:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked with him on his campaign
other satellites, if they
were involved, go after them.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, that's OK.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But could you go easy on Mike?

06:43.600 --> 06:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea of clearing out the
room, clearing out the -- the
attorney general of the United

06:48.100 --> 06:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States walking out.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Jeff Sessions had
a terrible day yesterday,
and so did Reince Priebus,
the chief of staff

06:56.166 --> 07:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the White House, when it
was revealed that they left the
president alone, left the FBI

07:02.033 --> 07:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
director one-on-one with the
president and, for, obviously,
purpose that the president

07:05.066 --> 07:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wanted special favors.

07:07.066 --> 07:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, he was
saying go easy on - - lay off
of Mike Flynn and tell the world

07:12.233 --> 07:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I'm in the clear.

07:13.166 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm in the clear.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, so
it comes down to he said vs.
he said, and you were saying

07:19.233 --> 07:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a minute ago, this
could drag on for years.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much damage has been done?

07:23.133 --> 07:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're talking -- I hear you
referring to the culture.

07:25.966 --> 07:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How much damage is being
done to this president?

07:28.433 --> 07:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I
think modest damage
around the country.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we just heard, around the
country, it wasn't as big a
story as it was in Washington.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was at O'Hare Airport
trying to watch it on TV.

07:36.733 --> 07:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't find any TVs
that had the hearings on.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They were all on
sports channels.

07:40.566 --> 07:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm not sure,
politically, immediately.

07:42.833 --> 07:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think the scandal here,
the fact Trump will probably be
investigated for obstruction,

07:49.733 --> 07:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and maybe Sessions will be
investigated, and once these
investigations started, they go

07:53.566 --> 07:54.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on forever.

07:54.733 --> 07:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Whitewater started
as a land deal.

07:57.066 --> 08:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when it started,
Monica Lewinsky was an
unknown person in college.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it turned into the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.

08:03.533 --> 08:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They go on for years
and they spread out.

08:06.033 --> 08:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what happens within the
administration is, nobody
knows who's being investigated.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody knows who is
saying what under oath.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if Donald Trump is really
willing 100 percent to testify
under oath, he's very naive

08:16.800 --> 08:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what that process means,
about what happens when you
start shifting your stories,

08:21.133 --> 08:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happens when you
start talking the way
Donald Trump normally
talks, which is imprecise,

08:25.933 --> 08:27.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at best.

08:27.866 --> 08:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that sort of thing
is bound to get an
administration in trouble.

08:30.966 --> 08:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that will become
the rising tide that will not
destroy this administration,

08:37.900 --> 08:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's going to be a long,
slow entanglement in the culture
of crisis and the culture of

08:41.633 --> 08:43.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scandal.

08:43.666 --> 08:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Let me give
you an immediate problem
that they have, Judy.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a gubernatorial
race in Virginia.

08:48.433 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginia, New Jersey
have off-year elections.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Tuesday is the
primary in Virginia.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the lieutenant governor, a
rather mild-mannered pediatric
doctor, surgeon, is running on a

09:05.600 --> 09:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slogan and a TV ad that
says, do not let this
narcissistic maniac,
Donald Trump, which tells

09:12.900 --> 09:14.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you two things.

09:14.933 --> 09:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, sort of where -- we
have debased the dialogue
and debate in America.

09:18.566 --> 09:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is he doing it, though?

09:20.600 --> 09:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's running it because
he's challenged by a
former congressman,
Tom Perriello, who is

09:24.133 --> 09:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backed by an awful lot of
Obama people, in Bernie
Sanders, Elizabeth Warren.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And why is he running this way?

09:30.933 --> 09:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, in Virginia,
among Democratic voters,
according to the Quinnipiac
poll, Donald Trump

09:37.366 --> 09:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is 95 percent unfavorable
and 3 percent favorable.

09:41.033 --> 09:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's what Republicans
are facing right now.

09:43.400 --> 09:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They cannot embrace him,
because he's going to be Typhoid
Mary in November of 2018.

09:50.366 --> 09:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David,
as you and Mark just heard in
Hari's interview with those

09:53.700 --> 09:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporters from Nevada and
Indiana and West Virginia,
they're saying, you know, a lot

10:00.566 --> 10:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people are going about
their lives and a lot of people
who voted for Donald Trump

10:03.366 --> 10:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are just not paying
much attention.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think
that's generally true.

10:07.433 --> 10:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There has been slippage
among Republicans since
he was inaugurated.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican support
is down 7 percent.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among those who are really
strongly supporting him,
it's down a little more.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so there's
been some slippage.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a slow erosion.

10:20.866 --> 10:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, right now, he can only
-- he is at 39, or whatever it
is, percent approval rating.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

10:25.933 --> 10:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is bad, but
it's not cataclysmic,
especially among his base.

10:28.433 --> 10:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So the problem is right
now not a mass public
erosion of support.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the problem is
in Washington, where he
actually has to govern.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The senators, as Mark
said, did a very good job.

10:38.766 --> 10:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there is a huge wall
of difference between a
lot of those Republican
senators and the

10:43.766 --> 10:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump administration.

10:45.266 --> 10:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are not going
to be getting any closer.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mark?

10:48.366 --> 10:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Just,
Judy, one point David
made about the interest.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nielsen ratings
just came out.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were 19.5 million people
who watched that daytime.

10:56.466 --> 10:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It began 7:00 on the West Coast.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

11:00.533 --> 11:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a big audience, Judy.

11:02.933 --> 11:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Compare it, there were
20 million who watched
Sunday night's NBA final
between the Cleveland

11:07.866 --> 11:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Cavaliers and the
Golden State Warriors.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a turnout.

11:13.433 --> 11:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot more people obviously
saw the news and the clips
and the reports and this show.

11:19.366 --> 11:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think, you know, it's
not the same thing as, you
know, war coverage or whatever,

11:26.666 --> 11:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but there is real
interest in this.

11:29.333 --> 11:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, I
hear -- just quickly, I hear
both of you saying it's right

11:33.466 --> 11:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now mainly in Washington, but
that's going to filter down,
that's going to have an eventual

11:39.333 --> 11:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effect on how people view this.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

11:43.366 --> 11:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could have had a day where
the Trump administration
really was in like
Titanic-like peril, if

11:46.366 --> 11:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there had been some
testimony about collusion,
if there had been some
really strong, repeated

11:52.566 --> 11:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
push for him to
obstruct justice.

11:53.466 --> 11:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we didn't have that.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we're looking
more long-term now.

11:57.233 --> 12:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David
Brooks, Mark Shields,
see you next Friday.

12:01.033 --> 12:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.
