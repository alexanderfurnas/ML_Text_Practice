WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as we have heard, a number
of patient groups and major
players in the health care

00:06.800 --> 00:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry have opposed
the Senate bill.

00:08.700 --> 00:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Every major hospital
group has criticized it.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say they are especially
worried about deep reductions
in Medicaid spending for the

00:15.933 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
poor and those with
disabilities, changes
that include new limits
like spending caps

00:20.800 --> 00:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or block grants that would
eventually cut the number
of people on Medicaid.

00:25.733 --> 00:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospitals say they will end
up paying the difference
by treating the uninsured.

00:29.900 --> 00:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While I was in Colorado for the
Aspen Spotlight Health Festival
last week, I spoke with Kenneth

00:34.800 --> 00:36.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's president and CEO of the
Mount Sinai Health System,
which includes seven hospitals

00:42.433 --> 00:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and more than 140
ambulatory centers and
practices in New York.

00:45.700 --> 00:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Ken Davis, thank you very
much for talking with us.

00:50.166 --> 00:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were quoted recently as
commenting on the House version
of the Republican overhaul

00:55.133 --> 00:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:56.966 --> 01:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You said it would have
a fairly devastating
effect on the country.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that the way you feel
about the Senate version too?

01:03.600 --> 01:05.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS, President
and CEO, Mount Sinai
Health System: Absolutely.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, if anything, there are
aspects of the Senate bill that
can be even more problematic.

01:10.033 --> 01:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Particularly, the glide path
to per capita or block grants
is going to produce a lower

01:17.100 --> 01:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reimbursement for the states
than was even in the House bill.

01:20.033 --> 01:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about
the effect on hospitals?

01:22.433 --> 01:24.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:24.433 --> 01:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, there
are a number of things
that impact hospitals.

01:26.866 --> 01:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of them collectively,
particularly for hospitals that
have a reasonable number of

01:31.200 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid patients,
are pretty difficult.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are substantial cuts.

01:37.466 --> 01:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, the public
hospitals -- the Health and
Hospital Corporation in New York

01:40.800 --> 01:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
City, they can't possibly
sustain these cuts to
the Medicaid budget.

01:45.033 --> 01:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Other hospitals that
have a large number of
Medicaid patients have
a very tiny margin.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That margin evaporates
with this bill.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that
-- even with tweaking,
you're saying there's
literally no way around?

01:58.266 --> 02:00.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well,
fundamentally, this
bill is about decreasing
Medicaid and decreasing

02:02.566 --> 02:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what states receive for
Medicaid and decreasing,
in the House case, those
who have the extended

02:08.800 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
benefits or the eligibility that
they previously didn't have.

02:14.366 --> 02:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bill isn't that much
around tweaks to Obamacare.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a little bit.

02:18.633 --> 02:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a bit to tweak the
exchanges, but the money's
coming from Medicaid.

02:22.433 --> 02:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And unless they take
a completely different
approach to Medicaid,
I don't see that tweaks

02:26.033 --> 02:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are going to help.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there are
observers of the health care
system who look at all this,

02:29.733 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they say hospitals are
a big part of the problem.

02:32.700 --> 02:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're consolidating.

02:33.733 --> 02:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are mergers.

02:35.233 --> 02:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Doctors are cutting
deal with hospitals.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody's making more money.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hospitals are charging more.

02:41.766 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What could hospitals do that
they aren't doing now to get
some of these costs down?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well,
let's remember all
hospitals are not alike.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In many cases, geography
is destiny in hospitals.

02:53.700 --> 02:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you're in a system like
ours, in which the vast majority
of our payments are either

02:58.066 --> 03:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid or Medicare,
that's fixed.

03:01.100 --> 03:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the size of our hospital
system isn't going to change
how much Medicaid reimbursement

03:05.200 --> 03:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or Medicare
reimbursement we get.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Additionally, as some systems
have increased in size, they
have done so in order that they

03:14.566 --> 03:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
can move away from
fee-for-service medicine
to what's called value.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To do that, to be a system
that can take risk and value,
you have to be large enough so

03:23.900 --> 03:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that patients don't
escape your network.

03:26.266 --> 03:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's part of the thing
that is driving consolidation.

03:28.300 --> 03:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is enough
being done, you think,
to be mindful of costs?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:34.033 --> 03:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, the margins
in many hospitals are so small
that, if you are not fixated

03:38.866 --> 03:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on costs, you are bankrupt.

03:40.966 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in New York state, we
have seen 30-plus hospitals
go bankrupt in recent years.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the lesson is?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: The lesson is,
we are focused on expenses.

03:49.766 --> 03:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to be
fixated on expenses.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we really need to do
-- and we were trying to do
this previously -- and hopefully

03:55.500 --> 03:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can continue to do this
-- is ask, how can we deliver
health care in a different,

03:59.233 --> 04:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more efficient,
cost-efficient way?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The system is failing us.

04:03.866 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The macroeconomics of
health care are such
that the government can't
afford it, the states

04:07.733 --> 04:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't afford it, the employers
can't afford it, and the
employees can't afford it.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have got to ask is,
what's wrong with the system
and how do we change it so that

04:15.666 --> 04:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's more efficient
for everybody?

04:17.333 --> 04:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You
brought up Medicaid.

04:18.866 --> 04:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were saying how much of this
legislation is around Medicaid.

04:22.533 --> 04:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many who say that
the Medicaid expansion that
was part of the Affordable
Care Act originally,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I know you were
strongly for, the critics
say this was simply throwing
money at an inefficient

04:35.366 --> 04:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, poor-quality care,
people on Medicaid don't get the
same level of care that others

04:41.133 --> 04:43.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

04:43.100 --> 04:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they point to studies
showing that, even with the
expansion of Medicaid, that that

04:49.000 --> 04:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care is not getting much better.

04:50.833 --> 04:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you respond?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, those
studies or study doesn't
take a very long perspective.

04:57.400 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't see the difference
in things like mortality
for quite some time.

05:02.066 --> 05:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you're lowering
people's hemoglobin A1c
or better controlling
their blood pressure,

05:09.100 --> 05:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it can take sometimes years
before you see an extension of
a lifespan in those patients.

05:14.133 --> 05:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we did find,
what was reported was an
improvement in mental health.

05:19.066 --> 05:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it seems like people
have forgotten that.

05:22.033 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The largest provider of
payment for addiction
services is Medicaid.

05:29.066 --> 05:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty percent of all Medicaid
recipients, at the very least,
have mental health problems.

05:34.966 --> 05:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To take that out of the equation
is very, very destructive.

05:39.033 --> 05:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to think that we're not
having a positive influence --
because the only thing we really

05:43.200 --> 05:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directly affect and that
we can measure short-term
is improvement in mental
health -- is a little

05:47.700 --> 05:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demeaning to our psychiatrists.

05:49.766 --> 05:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me go back
to the mega-question about our
whole -- our health care system.

05:55.733 --> 05:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What conservatives are arguing,
among other things, is that
when you have health care,

06:01.200 --> 06:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rising costs of health care
driving at least a sixth of the
economy, that something's really

06:05.966 --> 06:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of whack, that the whole
system is too expensive,
too out of control.

06:12.533 --> 06:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Government participating
in it is helping to
drive up those costs.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do they have a point?

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Not really.

06:19.833 --> 06:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We lose money on every Medicaid
patient who walks through our
door, whether it's inpatient

06:23.266 --> 06:24.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or outpatient.

06:24.266 --> 06:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the cost of health care.

06:26.333 --> 06:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they were truly interested
in the question of why is our
system so expensive, this would

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a bill about how we move
away from fee-for-service
medicine, in which
physicians and hospitals

06:37.933 --> 06:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get paid for everything they
do, and moving more toward value
and risk, in which patients,

06:43.300 --> 06:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
providers are all aligned, such
that everyone wants you to stay
well and out of the hospital.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would have more incentives
for readmission penalties.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We would have incentives
for shorter stay.

06:53.466 --> 06:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would have more incentives to
bring care to a less expensive
place, like the ambulatory

06:58.933 --> 07:00.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
setting.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But those issues aren't
being addressed in this bill.

07:03.066 --> 07:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And your
point is conservatives may
make that argument, but
they're not promoting...

07:06.500 --> 07:08.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

07:08.533 --> 07:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: If they are
truly interested in changing
the cost structure, making it

07:12.100 --> 07:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more efficient and less
expensive, they have
got to deal with reforms
that actually affect

07:17.700 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those metrics.

07:19.233 --> 07:20.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And these don't.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Ken Davis,
we thank you very much.

07:22.666 --> 07:23.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

07:23.666 --> 07:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Thank you.
