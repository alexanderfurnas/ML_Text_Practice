JUDY WOODRUFF: The escalation
of President Trump's criticism
of Jeff Sessions exposes

00:04.333 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare public divide between
an American president
and his attorney general.

00:10.066 --> 00:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

00:12.033 --> 00:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I'm disappointed
in the attorney general.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He shouldn't have
recused himself.

00:18.766 --> 00:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
president's latest salvo
came this afternoon,
at his news conference

00:22.166 --> 00:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Lebanon's prime minister.

00:24.533 --> 00:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That followed a morning
broadside on Twitter, declaring:
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions

00:31.466 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has taken a very weak
position on Hillary Clinton
crimes and intel leakers."

00:37.066 --> 00:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yesterday, another
tweet that called
Sessions "our beleaguered
A.G." and plaintively

00:41.200 --> 00:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked why he's not
investigating Hillary Clinton.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what is next?

00:45.666 --> 00:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The president said this today:

00:47.733 --> 00:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I want
the attorney general
to be much tougher on
leaks from intelligence

00:52.700 --> 00:53.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

00:53.666 --> 00:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see what happens.

00:55.266 --> 00:57.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Time will tell.

00:57.466 --> 01:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sessions
was a veteran Republican
senator from Alabama,
and in early 2016 became

01:02.700 --> 01:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first in that body to
endorse the Trump candidacy.

01:09.066 --> 01:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After he won, president-elect
Trump nominated him
as attorney general.

01:11.566 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But less than a month after
Sessions' confirmation,
it emerged that,
despite earlier denials,

01:18.466 --> 01:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had, in fact, met with
the Russian ambassador
during the campaign.

01:21.166 --> 01:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: I shouldn't be involved
in any campaign investigation.

01:25.133 --> 01:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In early March,
Sessions he recused himself from
Russia-related investigations,

01:32.166 --> 01:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a decision still angers the
president, as he made clear to
The New York Times last week.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How do you take a
job, and then recuse yourself?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he would have recused
himself before the job, I would
have said, thanks, Jeff, but

01:42.366 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't -- I'm not
going to take you.

01:45.933 --> 01:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's extremely unfair,
and that's a mild
word, to the president.

01:50.266 --> 01:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The next
day, Sessions said he
has no plans to resign.

01:53.933 --> 01:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: We love this job.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love this department.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I plan to continue to do so
as long as that is appropriate.

02:00.966 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The attorney
general has not been heard from
since, but several Republican

02:07.166 --> 02:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senators have rallied to
their former colleague.

02:09.166 --> 02:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, South Carolina's Lindsey
Graham called the president's
rebuke of Sessions for not

02:14.966 --> 02:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecuting Hillary Clinton
highly inappropriate.

02:17.966 --> 02:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Utah's Orrin Hatch
said he was surprised.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah:
Jeff has been very loyal
to the president, and
I think he deserves

02:25.166 --> 02:27.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loyalty back.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Democrats warned
that forcing out Sessions
would spark a new firestorm.

02:29.966 --> 02:32.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:32.066 --> 02:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Many Americans must
be wondering if the president

02:34.233 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is trying to pry open the office
of attorney general to appoint
someone during the August

02:41.200 --> 02:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recess who will fire special
counsel Mueller and shut down
the Russia investigation.

02:47.900 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even so, the
new White House communications
director, Anthony Scaramucci,

02:54.500 --> 02:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
told conservative radio
host Hugh Hewitt that
the die may be cast.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HUGH HEWITT, Radio Talk
Show Host: It's clear
the president wants him
gone, isn't it, Anthony?

02:59.966 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, White House
Communications Director: I have
an enormous amount of respect

03:02.333 --> 03:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the attorney general,
but I do know the
president pretty well.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there's this
level of tension in the
relationship, that that's
public, you're probably

03:12.833 --> 03:14.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

03:14.866 --> 03:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A Scout is
trustworthy, loyal - - we
could use some more loyalty.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will tell you that.

03:20.766 --> 03:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: that level of
tension may have been in play
last night at the Boy Scouts'

03:24.033 --> 03:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Jamboree.

03:26.133 --> 03:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president brought
with him Cabinet members
and former Scouts Ryan
Zinke and Rick Perry,

03:32.433 --> 03:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but Eagle Scout Jeff Sessions
was nowhere to be seen.

03:35.766 --> 03:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A very high-level rift
now out in the open.

03:39.166 --> 03:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get more from our own John
Yang, reporting from the White
House, and Sari Horwitz, who

03:45.533 --> 03:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
covers the Justice Department
for The Washington Post.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John, you were at that
press conference today.

03:49.266 --> 03:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does this leave things
as far as Jeff Sessions
holding on to his job?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, you know,
the president rejected
the suggestion of a
reporter that he had been

03:58.900 --> 04:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving Jeff Sessions slowly
twisting in the wind, to
use an old Watergate phrase.

04:05.933 --> 04:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, as you
heard in your report, he said
he's got no timeline for when

04:10.066 --> 04:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's going to make a decision.

04:12.100 --> 04:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is clear that the president
sees a direct line from Jeff
Sessions' recusing himself

04:18.266 --> 04:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Russia investigation
to the appointment of
Robert Mueller as the
special counsel and

04:24.100 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this investigation that
is dogging him still.

04:27.300 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told The Wall Street Journal
in an interview before that news
conference, if Jeff Sessions

04:34.233 --> 04:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't recuse himself, we
wouldn't even be talking
about this subject.

04:37.233 --> 04:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's clear he is still very
frustrated, very, in his words,
disappointed in his attorney

04:43.066 --> 04:45.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And,
Sari Horwitz, is there
anything more coming out
of the Justice Department?

04:47.633 --> 04:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we know how the attorney
general is taking all this?

04:50.633 --> 04:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ, The Washington
Post: Well, you know, it's just
been an extraordinary spectacle

04:54.066 --> 04:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
playing out here in Washington.

04:56.100 --> 05:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been at the Justice
Department all day, and all
indications are that Jeff

05:02.133 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions is not going to resign
and that he's moving forward
with his conservative agenda.

05:05.500 --> 05:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He, really more than any other
Cabinet member, has been putting
many place, moving quickly,

05:12.400 --> 05:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
methodically to undo Holder,
Eric Holder, and Obama policies
at the Justice Department,

05:18.566 --> 05:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he's moving forward on that.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's compartmentalizing these
disparaging comments by the
president, which I'm being

05:24.600 --> 05:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told by people at the Justice
Department he's been doing since
he got in as attorney general

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in February.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he recused himself
in March, and this has
been going on since March.

05:34.233 --> 05:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sari, you and
your colleagues reported today
on discussions within the White

05:40.400 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
House about replacing
Jeff Sessions and how
that might happen.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, those discussions
are taking place?

05:46.066 --> 05:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: We heard they
had been taking place up until
now, but it's interesting.

05:50.566 --> 05:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the conservative media,
Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh,
conservative senators came

05:57.566 --> 06:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out and said, we like the
policies Jeff Sessions
has been putting in place.

06:00.200 --> 06:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And actually, today, late
afternoon, Jeff Sessions
announced another new
policy, a conservative

06:07.000 --> 06:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy, to crack down
on so-called sanctuary
cities and tie very
important federal grants

06:12.466 --> 06:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to local cities and
states, to tie those
grants to restrictions.

06:16.866 --> 06:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, if the states seem to be
harboring illegal immigrants,
undocumented immigrants, they

06:22.733 --> 06:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
won't give them the money.

06:24.766 --> 06:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're hearing is,
tomorrow or the next day, he's
going to be announcing that

06:28.833 --> 06:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Justice Department is indeed
doing leak investigations.

06:31.966 --> 06:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: John, what do
you make of the support that
has been ever more vocal today,

06:38.400 --> 06:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, for Jeff Sessions
from friends and allies?

06:40.433 --> 06:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I think,
Jeff, it really is one of the
conundrums of this, is that

06:45.066 --> 06:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is extremely popular among
Mr. Trump's base, largely
because of what Sari has just

06:51.866 --> 06:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been talking about, his
stand on illegal immigration,
on sanctuary cities.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember that he was actually
Steve Bannon's first choice
to be a presidential candidate

07:03.266 --> 07:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of his
immigration policies.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then it became clear
that he wasn't going to run.

07:08.700 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that -- and one
of the outside people that
President Trump talked to, has

07:15.600 --> 07:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been talking to about this
tells me that this is something
he did remind him, that Jeff

07:19.000 --> 07:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sessions is very
popular among his base.

07:21.766 --> 07:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you heard it from
a lot of particularly
Southern conservative
Democrats on the hill

07:26.400 --> 07:28.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, John, we
did hear also at the press
conference the president again

07:30.533 --> 07:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
raising the issue
of leaks today.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that remains
connected to all of this.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And you also have
to wonder if that's -- if
what he's talking about with

07:40.033 --> 07:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his tweets -- and, by the way,
you know, as Sari points out,
he is going after a member

07:44.800 --> 07:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his own Cabinet as if he was
one of his primary opponents
in last year's election

07:52.333 --> 07:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - if this constant
pressure on Sessions isn't
some sort of leverage to
get the Justice Department

07:57.433 --> 08:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to act on these leaks, which
have been his real bugaboo in
all these stories coming out

08:04.733 --> 08:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Russia investigation.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sari,
just in our last 30
seconds, what about that?

08:08.600 --> 08:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about the leaks
connection to all this sort
of public furor we're hearing?

08:13.133 --> 08:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: We know Trump is
angry about the leaks, and as
I said, we have been hearing

08:17.200 --> 08:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late afternoon at the Justice
