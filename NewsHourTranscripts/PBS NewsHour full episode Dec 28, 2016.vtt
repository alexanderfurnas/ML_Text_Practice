HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.976 --> 00:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The two-state
solution is the only way to
achieve a just

00:13.814 --> 00:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and lasting peace between
Israelis and Palestinians.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Secretary of
State John
Kerry warns Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu

00:20.687 --> 00:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that his continued support of
settlements
in the West Bank undermines
peace in the region.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: Donald Trump's
promise to drain
the special interest swamp of
Washington.

00:31.231 --> 00:34.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can the president-elect succeed
where previous
politicians failed?

00:34.935 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus, a banner year for
television, from a
story of young rappers trying to
make it in

00:40.407 --> 00:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Atlanta to Louis C.K.'s surprise
Web series.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL, Uproxx: I
haven't even heard
of some of these shows, and it's
my job to

00:47.648 --> 00:52.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watch television. That's how
much great stuff
is out there. It's ridiculous.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.755 --> 00:58.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.992 --> 01:10.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From
president-elect Trump
today, an announcement of new
jobs coming

01:10.804 --> 01:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the U.S. They're from telecom
giant Sprint
and OneWeb, a satellite firm
that plans to

01:15.776 --> 01:21.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer low-cost Internet access
around the
world. Mr. Trump spoke at his
Mar-a-Lago resort

01:21.081 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida, and said it's thanks
to a Japanese
billionaire who has pledged to
invest $50

01:25.185 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
billion dollars in the U.S.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We have
a combination of Sprint for
5,000 jobs, and

01:30.324 --> 01:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's coming from all over
world, and they're
coming back into the U.S. which
is a nice

01:35.796 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change, and also OneWeb, 3,000
jobs. It's
a new company.

01:39.633 --> 01:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Separately,
the president-elect
accused President Obama of
making inflammatory

01:45.973 --> 01:50.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statements and throwing up
roadblocks. He
tweeted: "Thought it was going
to be a smooth

01:50.744 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
transition. Not."

01:52.245 --> 01:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, though, he told reporters
that it's
all going "very, very smoothly."

01:56.917 --> 02:00.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has designated
new national
monuments in Utah and Nevada
this evening.

02:00.754 --> 02:06.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Bears Ears Monument in Utah
covers more
than 1.3 million acres of tribal
lands, with

02:06.360 --> 02:11.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an estimated 100,000
archaeological sites.
In Nevada, the Gold Butte
National Monument

02:11.965 --> 02:17.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will cover 300,000 acres. It's
near where
rancher Cliven Bundy led a
standoff with federal

02:18.005 --> 02:19.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agents in 2014.

02:19.973 --> 02:24.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was talk today of a
nationwide cease-fire
in Syria, worked out by Turkey
and Russia.

02:24.711 --> 02:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state-run Turkish news
agency reported
it's happening, but the two
governments wouldn't

02:28.949 --> 02:34.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirm it. Syrian rebel leaders
called such
talk premature. Meanwhile,
Turkey said again

02:34.788 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is still opposed to keeping
Bashar al-Assad
in power. Russia supports the
Syrian president.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian search teams have
recovered the second
flight recorder from a Russian
military plane

02:44.631 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that crashed into the Black Sea.
All 92 people
on board were killed in Sunday's
disaster.

02:49.302 --> 02:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crews pulled the second recorder
from the
water today, and investigators
voiced hope

02:52.672 --> 02:54.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that its data is intact.

02:54.775 --> 02:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
handles are
not broken, which is the first
sign showing

02:59.246 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that probably it isn't damaged
inside. If
there wasn't any impact of the
saltwater,

03:04.251 --> 03:06.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the tape will be in a good
condition.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two Russian
news outlets
reported that just before the
crash, a cockpit

03:09.956 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crew member yelled about a
problem with the
wing flaps and then shouted that
the plane

03:14.661 --> 03:16.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was falling.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
German authorities have detained
a second
suspect in the attack on a
Berlin Christmas

03:19.699 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market last week. Prosecutors
say the Tunisian
man was a contact of Anis Amri.
He is believed

03:24.738 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have driven the truck that
killed 12 people.
Amri was shot dead last week by
police Italy.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unclear what role the new
suspect might
have played in the Berlin
attack.

03:34.581 --> 03:39.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece says it plans to build
smaller detention
centers to improve living
conditions for migrants

03:39.486 --> 03:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on outlying islands. The Greek
migration minister
the goal is to reduce crime and
speed up the

03:44.658 --> 03:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asylum process for some 15,000
people. Meanwhile,
another 48 migrants were rescued
today between

03:50.931 --> 03:56.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Greek island of Chios and
the Turkish
coast. They were packed on to a
rubber dinghy.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the man
convicted in
a church massacre in South
Carolina says he

03:59.806 --> 04:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will not present witnesses or
evidence, as
he faces a possible death
sentence. Dylann

04:04.811 --> 04:09.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roof spoke as his own attorney
at a hearing
in Charleston today. The
punishment phase

04:09.282 --> 04:13.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his hate crimes trial begins
next week.
The jury already found Roof
guilty of killing

04:13.887 --> 04:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nine black worshipers in 2015.

04:16.790 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street sold off today,
after a sharp
drop in home resales for
November. The Dow

04:21.094 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost
111 points to
close at 19833. The Nasdaq fell
nearly 49

04:26.633 --> 04:30.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped
almost 19.

04:30.203 --> 04:34.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the increasingly
complex relationship between the
U.S. and

04:35.008 --> 04:39.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel; what will it take for
Donald Trump
to keep his promise to drain the
Washington

04:39.579 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swamp?; a look back at 2016
through the lens
of science; and much more.

04:49.623 --> 04:55.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swamp?; a look back at 2016
through the lens
of science; and much more.

04:55.228 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tensions flared again today
between the Obama
administration and the Israeli
government

04:59.499 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. The
verbal fireworks came after the
United States

05:04.171 --> 05:08.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abstained from voting on a
United Nations
Security Council resolution
which condemned

05:08.942 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the continued construction of
settlements
on the West Bank.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Secretary of State John
Kerry joined
the fray.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Margaret Warner begins.

05:16.917 --> 05:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a
parting warning
shot that pulled no punches:

05:21.288 --> 05:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Friends
need to tell each other the hard
truths, and

05:26.993 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friendships require mutual
respect.

05:29.796 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary of
State John Kerry
today blamed Israel's -- quote
-- "most right-wing

05:35.635 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government ever" for expanding
Jewish settlements
into Palestinian areas in a way
that will

05:40.874 --> 05:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make a two-state solution
impossible to achieve.

05:43.944 --> 05:51.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: Here is a
fundamental reality:
If the choice is one state,
Israel can either

05:51.918 --> 05:59.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be Jewish or democratic. It
cannot be both.
And it won't ever really be at
peace.

05:59.726 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That, he said,
is why the
Obama administration chose not
to veto last

06:05.098 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday's U.N. Security Council
condemning
settlement building.

06:09.903 --> 06:15.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: The vote in the
United Nations
was about preserving the
two-state solution.

06:15.842 --> 06:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we were standing up
for: Israel's
future as a Jewish and
democratic state, living

06:21.715 --> 06:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side by side in peace and
security with its
neighbors.

06:24.451 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Kerry, who
spent years trying
to broker Israeli-Palestinian
peace, firmly

06:29.823 --> 06:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denied Israel's charges that the
U.S. helped
draft the resolution.

06:34.728 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry pointed to the relentless
growth of
Jewish settlements east of the
1967 border

06:40.133 --> 06:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into formerly Palestinian
territory of the
West Bank captured by Israel in
the Six-Day

06:45.839 --> 06:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War. There are 270,000 more
Jewish settlers
in the West Bank today than in
the early 1990s,

06:54.514 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he noted, 100,000 more than when
President
Obama took office.

06:58.118 --> 07:02.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: It's not just a
question of the
overall amount of land available
in the West

07:02.689 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bank; it's whether the land can
be connected
or is broken up into small
parcels like Swiss

07:09.029 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cheese that could never
constitute a real
state.

07:12.866 --> 07:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Israel's prime
minister fired
back, saying the speech focused
obsessively

07:17.737 --> 07:19.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on settlements.

07:19.539 --> 07:24.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
I must express my deep
disappointment with

07:24.411 --> 07:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the speech today of John Kerry,
a speech that
was almost as unbalanced as the
anti-Israel

07:32.252 --> 07:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resolution passed at the U.N.
last week.

07:34.554 --> 07:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Earlier, a
Jerusalem committee
did delay approving nearly 500
new Israeli

07:39.993 --> 07:43.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homes in its disputed eastern
area.

07:43.730 --> 07:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's exchange closes out a
rocky eight
years between the Obama
administration and

07:48.768 --> 07:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Netanyahu. This White House has
given Israel
more military aid than any
other. Yet last

07:54.874 --> 07:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year Netanyahu went around the
White House
to try to get Congress to
undercut the Iran

07:59.546 --> 08:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear deal. Netanyahu is now
counting on
the next U.S. president.

08:05.785 --> 08:10.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, president-elect Trump
called for
the U.S. to veto the U.N.
resolution. And

08:10.957 --> 08:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before Kerry's speech today, he
tweeted: "We
cannot continue to let Israel be
treated with

08:16.262 --> 08:23.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
such total disdain and
disrespect. Stay strong
Israel. January 20 is fast
approaching."

08:23.203 --> 08:26.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I love
Israel. I love Israel.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Trump has
pledged to
move the U.S. Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem.

08:30.944 --> 08:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he plans to nominate David
Friedman, a
firm supporter of expanding
settlements, as

08:36.483 --> 08:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. ambassador to Israel.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

08:41.421 --> 08:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
Kerry's speech,
the U.N. Security Council vote
and the state

08:46.159 --> 08:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of U.S.-Israel relations, we get
the views
of two people with extensive
diplomatic experience

08:50.663 --> 08:52.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Middle East.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Retired Ambassador James Jeffrey
was assistant
secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs

08:55.735 --> 09:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and was U.S. ambassador to Iraq
from 2010
to 2012. He's now at the
Washington Institute

09:01.174 --> 09:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Near East Policy. Ilan
Goldenberg was
part of Secretary Kerry's
negotiating team

09:05.945 --> 09:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the 2013-2014 final
status talks. He's
now at the Center for a New
American Security.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, I want to ask you
both.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ilan Goldenberg, I want to start
with you.
What's your reaction to Kerry's
speech today?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILAN GOLDENBERG, Former State
Department Official:
Well, the speech, it would have
been, I think,

09:19.692 --> 09:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a more meaningful speech perhaps
two years
ago.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the end of the day, it's
sort of a
swan song at the very end, but
there are still

09:25.832 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some very valuable things in it.
I think Kerry
led really what was only the
third time ever

09:31.638 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have had final status
negotiations
between Israelis and
Palestinians over the

09:35.975 --> 09:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entire course of the history of
the conflict.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think he had things the
add. I think
it was also important in the
context of the

09:41.848 --> 09:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incoming administration that,
you know, openly
questioning whether or not we
will continue

09:47.620 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to actually support the
two-state solution,
given who they have at least
nominated to

09:51.558 --> 09:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the next ambassador to
Israel.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this context, I think
more than anything
what shown through, and as
somebody who worked

09:57.730 --> 10:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Kerry on these issues both
in the Senate
and at the State Department, was
the man clearly

10:02.769 --> 10:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deeply cares about the issue. He
clearly cares
about the future of the Jewish
state. And

10:08.875 --> 10:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was really willing to go out
there, despite
a lot of criticism, and say
this.

10:14.547 --> 10:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also thought the other
thing I would
say about the speech was it
really -- it was

10:18.518 --> 10:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more balanced, I would
argue, than the
U.N. Security Council
resolution, really did

10:22.455 --> 10:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
address both the question of
Palestinian incitement
and support for violence, which
is a key problem

10:29.429 --> 10:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a key obstacle in the future
of the two-state
solution, but it also gave, I
think, the most

10:33.533 --> 10:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eloquent explanation we have
seen of what
the problem with the settlement
enterprise

10:40.373 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

10:42.075 --> 10:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't have a situation where
you have
90,000 Israeli settlers now
living outside

10:47.080 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
areas that even Israel
acknowledges will be
part of a future Palestinian
state, and you

10:53.186 --> 10:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try the remove just a few
hundred of them,
as Israel did a couple months
ago, and is

10:57.190 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still debating, in this deep
settlement Dimona,
and it causes this huge
political crisis.

11:02.095 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How are you ever going to get to
a situation
where you can actually get to a
two-state

11:08.034 --> 11:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solution or move the types of --
do the types
of population movements you're
going to have

11:11.471 --> 11:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do to get to that agreement?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Jeffrey,
your reactions?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Iraq:
Well, let me start with the
good.

11:16.309 --> 11:21.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kerry finished off by a
six-point way forward
which reflects longstanding U.S.
policy, but

11:21.781 --> 11:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it basically was done in a
balanced and comprehensive
way. So that's on the good side.

11:28.121 --> 11:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Less good is the language of his
explanation
of what the United States was
doing in the

11:35.495 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. and what our basic policies
are. Ilan
is right. Kerry was much more
temperate than

11:42.936 --> 11:49.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that frankly crazy U.N.
resolution, but he
still made the same error, which
is to blame

11:49.108 --> 11:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the entire problem in the peace
process on
Israel and these settlements,
and that isn't

11:54.514 --> 12:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the only problem, and, secondly,
to elevate
this Israeli-Palestinian dispute
to one of

12:01.354 --> 12:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the key threats to security in
the Middle
East.

12:04.223 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Good grief. We just saw what
happened in Syria
with Aleppo. We have ISIS still
on the road.

12:09.228 --> 12:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have Russia intervening in
the region.
This is not on anybody's
top-level priority

12:15.001 --> 12:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
list in the Middle East. Why the
administration
at this late hour went into this
thing the

12:20.206 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way it did, totally exasperating
the Israelis,
is beyond me.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Jeffrey,
there have
been U.N. Security Council
resolutions that

12:27.547 --> 12:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have come and gone for years and
years. Why
did this one have the type of
diplomatic ripple

12:31.918 --> 12:32.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effect that it's having?

12:33.019 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Good question.

12:34.854 --> 12:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been back all the way
to 1947 and
U.N. Resolution 181. Never have
I seen language

12:40.393 --> 12:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this that the U.S. let go
through, illegal
acts by the Israelis, flagrant
violation of

12:47.300 --> 12:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international law and on and on
and on, imperiling
peace.

12:51.037 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went back to Resolution 660,
which was what
the U.N. did when Saddam marched
into Kuwait.

12:57.543 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That resolution is not as strong
as this one.
It's that kind of blaming Israel
for everything

13:03.116 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing that is emotional, has
launched this
reaction in Israel, and it will
not help the

13:08.388 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cause of peace.

13:10.390 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Palestinian leader Abbas
gave his reaction
to Kerry's speech, he gave the
usual boilerplate

13:16.029 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how, if Israel stops the
settlements,
we will continue to work
together under international

13:21.034 --> 13:22.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

13:22.835 --> 13:26.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now that resolution is
international law,
and it basically condemns the
major Israeli

13:26.572 --> 13:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiating point, trading land
for peace,
into the category of illegal
occupation totally.

13:33.479 --> 13:39.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ilan
Goldenberg, is there
a significant change in the
relationship between

13:39.786 --> 13:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States and Israel? As
Margaret
pointed out in her tape, we just
approved

13:43.623 --> 13:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$38 billion in military aid.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILAN GOLDENBERG: Well, first, I
want to just
go back to the last point Jim
made. And I

13:48.895 --> 13:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreed with a lot of what he has
to say.

13:50.730 --> 13:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't actually think that
this resolution
fundamentally changes
international law or

13:55.168 --> 13:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international standing. I think
actually the
language in it comes directly
from the U.N.

13:59.839 --> 14:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Council Resolution 465,
which used
the exact same language when
discussing settlements.

14:05.311 --> 14:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, there's problems with
the language
and the fact that, you know, the
resolution

14:09.716 --> 14:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't differentiate between
East Jerusalem
and settlements that are deep in
the West

14:14.487 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bank. And I think ideally it
would be good
to have that kind of language.

14:18.324 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's just not true that
language doesn't
exist in any U.N. Security
Council resolution.

14:22.462 --> 14:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can't get the Security
Council to
agree to it. So, that's why you
have Kerry

14:27.767 --> 14:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alternatively coming through and
laying out
the American position afterward,
which very

14:33.172 --> 14:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly talks about swaps that
are agreed
upon between the parties and
addresses that

14:37.777 --> 14:39.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
concern.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And actually even the resolution
itself, to
some extent, addresses that
concern, when

14:41.914 --> 14:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has -- when it says that
swaps will be
part of -- will have to be
agreed to between

14:48.221 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the parties.

14:49.956 --> 14:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I really question the notion
that this
resolution fundamentally
reorients overall

14:56.095 --> 15:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the negotiating terms of the
two-state solution.
But I agree that the U.N.
Security Council

15:01.300 --> 15:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ultimately and has been quite
anti-Israel
in its various positions over
the years.

15:08.674 --> 15:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason to abstain is because
the language
wasn't American policy and
because the venue

15:13.846 --> 15:18.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not as credible as it could
be if it was
more balanced in its approach
and actually

15:18.251 --> 15:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dealt more seriously with other
issues that
Jim mentioned, like Syria and
didn't single

15:23.823 --> 15:25.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out the Israelis.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I would argue that the
language doesn't
fundamentally change anything.
Settlements

15:29.362 --> 15:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are still a huge problem. But,
at the same
time, you know, yes, but
settlements are still

15:36.903 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge problem, but still this
is better than
any of the alternatives I saw
out there.

15:43.042 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Jeffrey,
this is the
strongest alliance that's
existed in the world

15:46.212 --> 15:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for decades. And how does what
happened in
literally one -- couple of
sentences at the

15:52.485 --> 15:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. Security Council with only
about three
or four weeks left in an
administration change

15:57.390 --> 15:59.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that alliance?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: It won't change
the alliance
fundamentally, because we'll
have a new administration

16:01.794 --> 16:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that gets to start from zero.

16:03.830 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it will start with a new
international
status. Here's where I would
disagree with

16:08.000 --> 16:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ilan. He's right about 465. He
forgot to add
that that was passed 36 years
ago. Since then,

16:13.372 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we haven't seen any language
like this. And
that language does have an
impact at the international

16:18.978 --> 16:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level, as Israel tries to form
formal and
informal alliances on things
like the fight

16:24.183 --> 16:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against ISIS in the Sinai with
Egypt, one
of the countries that sponsored
the resolution,

16:29.188 --> 16:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and deconflict our operations in
Syria and
Lebanon with Russia.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
These things do count in
international relations.
And this is a very bad step.

16:37.029 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Jeffrey,
Ilan Goldenberg,
thank you both.

16:45.104 --> 16:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ILAN GOLDENBERG: Thank you.

16:51.711 --> 16:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We turn now to
domestic
politics and potential changes
ahead under

16:58.451 --> 17:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, specifically
changes in Washington,
where Mr. Trump has pledged to
-- quote -- "drain

17:03.689 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the swamp."

LISA DESJARDINS: He repeatedly

government

17:20.206 --> 17:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corruption and to take our
country back from
the special interests. I want
the entire corrupt

17:26.646 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington establishment to hear
and heed
the words. We're going to drain
the swamp

17:33.152 --> 17:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

17:37.857 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, as
president-elect,
Donald Trump has laid out some
specifics.

17:41.327 --> 17:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider Trump's Contract With

The very first item? Amending

six years tops for House

for senators. A little farther
down, there's

17:58.678 --> 18:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a five-year ban on White House
and congressional
officials becoming lobbyists
after they leave

18:04.784 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government, and just under that,
a lifetime
ban on his White House officials
from ever

18:09.889 --> 18:12.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lobbying for foreign
governments.

18:12.358 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump is not the first to
make with this
cry. Consider then-candidate
Obama in 2008.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The key is whether or not we
have got priorities

18:21.000 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are working for you, as
opposed to those
who have been dictating the
policy in Washington

18:26.772 --> 18:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lately. And that's mostly
lobbyists and special
interests. We have got to put an
end to that.

18:30.910 --> 18:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Obama
banned former
lobbyists from serving in his
White House,

18:34.680 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he also gave some waivers.
As for Mr.
Trump, some of those he's picked
to help him

18:39.719 --> 18:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drain the swamp also happen to
be longtime
Washington hands.

18:42.655 --> 18:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mick Mulvaney, his pick for
budget director,
is a three-term congressman. And
his health

18:47.159 --> 18:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary choice, Tom Price, has
been in Congress
for more than a decade.

18:51.697 --> 18:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, some question if Mr.
Trump is serious,
especially after former House
Speaker Newt

18:56.669 --> 19:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gingrich said this to NPR last
week about
the drain the swamp motto:

19:00.406 --> 19:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
I'm told he now disclaims that.
He now says

19:03.376 --> 19:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was cute, but he doesn't want
to use it
anymore.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Gingrich issued
a full reversal
the next day, saying he was
wrong and the

19:09.415 --> 19:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect Trump is indeed
serious about
-- quote -- "draining the
swamp."

19:16.022 --> 19:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined by two guests with
careers focused
on how Washington works.

19:20.059 --> 19:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Miller is founder and
president of the
National Institute for Lobbying
and Ethics.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sheila Krumholz is executive
director
of the Center for Responsive
Politics.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks to you both.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Miller, let's start with
you.

19:31.237 --> 19:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, voters have a message
for Washington.
They feel that those in power
may not be enriching

19:36.375 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
themselves or may not be
connected to the
rest of the country. Donald
Trump is responding

19:40.579 --> 19:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that with some of these
ideas, like a lobbying
ban.

19:43.682 --> 19:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do lobbyists understand that
argument, and
how do you react to what Mr.
Trump is proposing?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL MILLER, Founder and
President, National
Institute for Lobbying and
Ethics: We understand

19:49.889 --> 19:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. I'm not sure the rest of
Washington gets
it, i.e., Congress.

19:54.060 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This election wasn't about
banning lobbyists.
This was about gridlock in
Washington. And

19:58.998 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of Congress have the
ability to vet
on or to pass legislation. We do
not. So,

20:04.470 --> 20:06.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yes, we do get that.

20:06.338 --> 20:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The things Mr. Trump is talking
about, one,
I would deem several of them
unconstitutional,

20:10.943 --> 20:14.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the others just unworkable
based on the
system that we have in place
today.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: First,
lobbyists aren't without
influence. To put all of
Washington's problems

20:19.718 --> 20:22.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the elected, is that
completely fair?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL MILLER: I would say yes.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I don't have a voter
card, unless
I missed it that day that it was
handed out

20:27.426 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I became a lobbyist that
said, you get
to go to the House or Senate
floor and vote

20:30.930 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on legislation, or you get to go
to the White
House and take that magic pen
and sign legislation

20:35.034 --> 20:36.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into law.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not the one sending myself
fund-raising
notices asking for money. So,
members of Congress

20:40.005 --> 20:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the administration could
just do their
thing, and they don't have to
say, hey, it's

20:44.777 --> 20:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lobbyists' fault. It's their
fault.

20:46.712 --> 20:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, what is
the problem
with saying, if you choose to
work for government,

20:51.517 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you must for five years after
that not become
a lobbyist for government? Why
is that -- what

20:56.722 --> 20:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problem is there with that?

20:58.657 --> 21:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MILLER: Because the way
some of the -- again,
we haven't seen all the details
of what Mr.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is proposing. It's always
the devil
is in those details, but some of
the legislation

21:04.930 --> 21:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is being proposed by
members of the House
that are out, this five-year ban
is for executive

21:10.569 --> 21:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- members of the executive
branch.

21:13.072 --> 21:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't now say a member of
Congress who
leaves, that you have to now
have a five-year

21:17.343 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ban on what you do. There's only
a two-year
cooling-off period for current
members of

21:20.546 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Congress and staff.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now you're going to say, for
executive
branch officials, it's five
years.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But do you have
a problem
with that on its own?

21:26.986 --> 21:31.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL MILLER: I do on the
five-year, yes. The
two-year is fine by my standard.

21:31.857 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an honor system program
anyway. My
issue with this whole thing is
that, one,

21:37.296 --> 21:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where else in America, what
profession do
you tell them that they cannot
practice their

21:41.200 --> 21:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
craft after they leave a job?
You talk about
the voters today. They don't
want career politicians.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you should want people coming
in and out
of government, and today this
ban prohibits

21:51.710 --> 21:53.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sheila
Krumholz, what do
you think about what Donald
Trump is doing

21:55.414 --> 22:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here? Is it time to restrict
lobbying activities
for those people who work for
us? Is it time

22:01.687 --> 22:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this conversation? What do
you make of
this?

22:03.489 --> 22:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ, Executive
Director, Center
for Responsive Politics: Well,
we're overdue

22:04.423 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the conversation.

22:06.292 --> 22:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And actually it's one that we
had in the last
-- the first term of the Obama
administration,

22:11.297 --> 22:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he campaigned in 2008 in
particular.
But it's easy to score points on
bashing Washington.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's just a perennial on any
presidential
campaign.

22:23.642 --> 22:27.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And lobbyists come in for most
of the slugs.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I see Paul...

22:29.515 --> 22:30.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:30.516 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:32.351 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: And it is an
industry that
I think bears more scrutiny,
because their

22:36.622 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole job, their mission is to
buy and trade
influence.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have access. So, if you
want to sell
a product and you need to
navigate the halls

22:47.032 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of power and you're not familiar
with Washington
or how legislation gets passed
or how regulations

22:51.637 --> 22:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get stopped, it is immensely
helpful to be
able to afford a lobbyist to
help you navigate.

22:56.575 --> 23:00.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, what you're
saying, they
play an important role in
Washington.

23:00.145 --> 23:03.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: Lobbyists
absolutely play
an important role, and they
provide information.

23:03.449 --> 23:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And information is always good.
More information
is better.

23:06.352 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But then my
question to you
both, though, is clearly do you
also place

23:10.489 --> 23:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the blame with Washington on
only our
elected officials? Or what else
in Washington

23:15.194 --> 23:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
culturally needs to change?

23:17.463 --> 23:22.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Donald Trump says
draining the swamp,
but he's tapping into something
here about

23:22.534 --> 23:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how voters feel toward all of
Washington.
From your point of view, Sheila,
what needs

23:26.038 --> 23:27.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to change culturally in
Washington?

23:27.840 --> 23:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: Well, I think
we need to
have a conversation about how
things really

23:32.845 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work in our democracy.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from our perspective, of
course, we study
campaign finance. So, from our
perspective,

23:38.851 --> 23:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major part of the problem and
the role is
money in politics, so how money
is raised,

23:45.090 --> 23:52.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the role of lobbyists in raising
it, and how
the system is kind of mutually
beneficial

23:52.164 --> 23:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between candidates, members of
Congress, and
lobbyists who help them, both
with legislation,

23:58.871 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crafting legislation, as well as
with raising
funds for their reelection.

24:01.774 --> 24:06.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Paul, one other
idea that
Donald Trump says he will launch
on day one

24:06.145 --> 24:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a constitutional amendment to
term-limit
politicians. You say that
elected officials

24:10.215 --> 24:11.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are the problem.

24:12.017 --> 24:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I did some research and
looked over the
past years. It turns out if you
look at the

24:15.788 --> 24:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data that members of the House
and Senate
generally 87 to 89 percent of
them return

24:21.927 --> 24:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each year. That's not a lot of
turnover. That's
not a lot of fresh views
necessarily in Congress.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think of this idea
for term limits?
You're critical of elected
officials. Is this

24:31.937 --> 24:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a way to solve that problem?

24:33.772 --> 24:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MILLER: Well, let me start
first by saying
-- correct something. Lobbyists
aren't hired

24:36.175 --> 24:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to buy people or buy members of
Congress.
We provide a valuable role in
the system of

24:40.312 --> 24:42.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We provide information. You go
to any House
or Senate office today and look
at the staff

24:44.283 --> 24:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have there, you're
talking about
20-something folks who don't
have expertise

24:50.222 --> 24:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in all areas that they're
responsible. They
may handle four or five
different issues,

24:53.759 --> 24:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and yet to say we're buying them
is just again
one of those...

24:56.495 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You're saying
you have expertise
that these young staffers do
not.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL MILLER: We do, and that
they need.

24:59.932 --> 25:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so to your other question
about term limits,
we already have term limits. If
people voted

25:07.373 --> 25:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in larger numbers, you could
take people and
say, OK, we want them out. But
you know what?

25:13.645 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2010, the turnover rate
has been higher.
We have, I think, three-quarters
of the Congress

25:17.850 --> 25:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has turned over since 2010, if
my numbers
are correct.

25:21.086 --> 25:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we do have the ability to
vote people out.
There's your term limits. You
just have to

25:25.758 --> 25:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get more people to want to vote.

25:27.593 --> 25:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All right, a
conversation
about term limits and lobbying
and government

25:30.462 --> 25:31.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will continue.

25:31.463 --> 25:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Paul Miller, thank you so much.

25:35.667 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sheila Krumholz, thank you for
joining us.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ: Thank you.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

25:47.212 --> 25:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
New York City
principal who's finding
solutions within New

25:51.383 --> 25:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York's segregated schools; and
two television
critics with their picks for the
top programs

25:56.722 --> 25:58.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the hot 2016 season.

25:58.524 --> 26:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: 2016 has been a wild
ride, one
that we're not likely to forget
anytime soon,

26:04.663 --> 26:09.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of it focused on politics,
but many things
happened in the world of science
and technology

26:09.134 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham starts our
review for our
weekly segment, the Leading
Edge.

26:14.339 --> 26:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Indeed, we
wanted to look
at some of the more remarkable
discoveries

26:18.610 --> 26:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and innovations, and setbacks
that we saw
in the scientific world this
year.

26:22.481 --> 26:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we welcome back our very
own science
correspondent, Miles O'Brien.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Good to be here,
William.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, everyone
is doing their
year-end best-of list for 2016.
Let's do ours.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scientifically, what's top of
your list?

26:33.091 --> 26:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Let's start with
basic research,
shall we, the real hard-core
science.

26:36.728 --> 26:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest one by far was a
historic find
announced in February, the
detection of gravity

26:42.067 --> 26:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waves. The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave
Observatory, or LIGO, confirmed
one of Einstein's

26:48.740 --> 26:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major predictions about the
nature of gravity,
namely, that the merging of two
black holes

26:53.645 --> 26:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should send subtle gravity waves
rippling
across space.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID REITZE, Executive
Director, Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory:
Ladies and

26:58.383 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gentlemen, we have detected
gravitational
waves. We did it.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:06.892 --> 27:08.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Excited
scientists there.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: LIGO scientists
managed to
find those waves measuring tiny
contractions

27:13.131 --> 27:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and expansions of space itself.

27:15.133 --> 27:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did this with two massive
laser facilities,
one in Louisiana, one in
Washington state,

27:20.806 --> 27:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pair of the most precise
rulers ever built,
if you will.

27:24.142 --> 27:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So why is this
scientific
discovery, why is this so high
on everyone's

27:28.080 --> 27:29.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
list?

27:29.848 --> 27:32.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it's as the
scientists
discovered a new language and
then learned

27:32.651 --> 27:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. And they can now directly
observe much
more precise, much more
fundamental forces

27:36.822 --> 27:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of nature, which opens up a
whole new realm
of experiments in precision.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like they used to be able
to see the
puddles, and now they can see
the whole rainstorm.

27:45.597 --> 27:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it adds fidelity to their
quest.

27:48.467 --> 27:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's stay
in space.
What other big discoveries,
innovations, what

27:52.137 --> 27:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else did we see out there?

27:53.939 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, I'm always
watching for
the possibility that there might
be life out

27:56.708 --> 27:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there. I assume you are too.

27:58.544 --> 28:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA's Kepler space telescope
added over 1,500
new exoplanets to the registry
in 2016, the

28:04.950 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
most...

28:05.951 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exoplanets.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exoplanets, these
are planets
that would be around another
solar system.

28:09.488 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right around a dozen of them
are in a
so-called habitable zone, the
Goldilocks site,

28:14.493 --> 28:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there might in fact
potentially be the
conditions for life.

28:19.298 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The total catalog now is 3,500
planets, a
smaller handful in the habitable
zone. No

28:25.437 --> 28:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one has checked in yet, no
aliens so far.

28:27.873 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A little closer to home, NASA's
Juno spacecraft
also entered orbit around
Jupiter. Juno sensors

28:33.745 --> 28:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will collect data on the gas
giant up close
in hopes of understanding how
Jupiter formed

28:39.851 --> 28:41.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and evolved.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, these are
all unmanned
missions that you have been
describing.

28:43.555 --> 28:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know there has been a lot of
effort in putting
us humans out into space. How
has that been

28:47.159 --> 28:48.827 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going?

28:48.860 --> 28:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the road to
Mars is long
and winding, to say the least,
William.

28:51.763 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Private companies are running
resupply missions
to the space station while
testing technology.

28:56.401 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The results have been mixed,
frankly. Among
the thrill of victory
highlights, in April,

29:00.472 --> 29:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket booster
landed upright
on a remote barge at sea. It was
a spectacular

29:08.146 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
picture, and they stuck it.

29:10.182 --> 29:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there were some agony in
defeat moments
as well. SpaceX, most notably in
September,

29:15.587 --> 29:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an explosion occurred during an
engine test
on the launchpad. It destroyed
the rocket,

29:21.059 --> 29:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its satellite payload, and a lot
of launch
facilities.

29:24.529 --> 29:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the second Falcon 9
failure in 15 months.
So, whether SpaceX can deliver
on its promise

29:30.502 --> 29:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of providing cheaper access to
space without
compromising safety, that
remains an open

29:36.308 --> 29:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question at the end of this
year.

29:38.043 --> 29:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit
about human health. And we have
seen this

29:41.947 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year scientists talking ever so
cautiously
about ending epidemics like the
HIV epidemic.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But insect-born diseases
certainly came roaring
back with a vengeance this year.

29:52.224 --> 29:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They certainly
became in the
realm of household lexicons,
when you start

29:56.561 --> 30:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about things like Zika.
It actually
became a household term because
of the global

30:01.233 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outbreak that occurred.

30:03.135 --> 30:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And scientists in Brazil linked
this mosquito-borne
virus to a rise in microcephaly
and other

30:08.073 --> 30:14.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
severe fetal brain defects. More
than 90,000
Zika infections reported in
Brazil in the

30:14.479 --> 30:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first few months of 2016. The
U.S. has seen
relatively fewer cases, about
5,000 known

30:20.185 --> 30:21.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infections.

30:21.987 --> 30:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The numbers on birth defects are
still rolling
in, but so far in the U.S., 11
percent of

30:26.324 --> 30:31.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Zika cases during pregnancy
have resulted
in birth defects, while Brazil's
rate is closer

30:31.530 --> 30:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 40 percent. Now, scientists
are trying
to find some solutions to all
this.

30:36.301 --> 30:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A vaccine, of course, would be
great, but
they're also in Brazil using
genetically modified

30:41.473 --> 30:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquitoes, deploying these
insects that are
tweaked in such a way that they
have a fatal

30:47.145 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gene that would spread in the
wild, sort of
a suicide gene. We will see if
that works.

30:51.550 --> 30:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO, Zika Researcher:
The beauty
about this technique is that it
can reach

30:55.220 --> 30:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mosquitoes where no other
technique can
find it. We're using mosquitoes
to fight themselves.

30:59.224 --> 31:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On the subject
of genetic
modification, where are we with
the technique

31:03.562 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known as CRISPR? This has been
heralded for
a year or so as one of the
greatest potential

31:08.500 --> 31:10.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discoveries.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As you know,
William, CRISPR
a breakthrough gene editing
technique using

31:12.504 --> 31:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proteins extracted from a type
of bacteria.

31:16.174 --> 31:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers are able to easily
target specific
DNA sequences, snip them and
replace them

31:22.147 --> 31:27.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with whatever they want. This
year, scientists
in China used CRISPR for the
first time to

31:27.185 --> 31:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
modify a human cell. They moved
immune cells
from a cancer patient, disabled
the gene which

31:33.759 --> 31:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes them less effective
against cancer and
then reinjected them back into
the patient.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, that's an exciting
prospect, to have
these kind of super-duper immune
cells going

31:42.334 --> 31:46.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after cancer. We don't know yet
if it's working,
though. The results aren't in.
So we will

31:46.304 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
watch that in 2017.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit
about technology.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Computers are getting faster.
They're getting
smarter. There's a lot of talk
about A.I.

31:52.844 --> 31:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and artificial intelligence. If
anywhere,
are we seeing this play out in
the world today?

31:57.449 --> 31:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Right in front of
us on the
road, William.

31:59.885 --> 32:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're seeing self-driving cars
appear much
faster than I think we are
probably ready

32:04.956 --> 32:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for. In parts of Pittsburgh now,
you can order
up a self-driving Uber. The
human being is

32:10.328 --> 32:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there to grab the wheel just in
case, but,
basically, we are well on our
way to a world

32:15.634 --> 32:18.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we're not necessarily
driving our cars
anymore.

32:18.069 --> 32:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past year, though, we did
have the first
death of a person using a
self-driving component

32:23.742 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Tesla Model S. So, that's
a little
piece of history and a reminder.
What Tesla

32:29.614 --> 32:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will tell you is, it's still, on
a per-mile
basis, much safer than human
beings driving.

32:35.287 --> 32:39.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Miles, before
you go, the
world of astronomy this week
lost one of its

32:39.257 --> 32:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
luminaries, Vera Rubin. Can you
tell us a
little bit about her?

32:41.893 --> 32:45.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know,
William, Vera Rubin
was an astronomer who changed
the way we think

32:45.063 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the universe and forced
the scientific
community to change the way it
treated women.

32:50.268 --> 32:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1970s, she realized that
galaxies are
spinning too fast, that they
would really

32:56.474 --> 33:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fly apart if they relied simply
on the gravity
of the things we can see around
them. She

33:01.580 --> 33:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knew there had to be something
else there,
a lot of something.

33:04.382 --> 33:08.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what led to the
discovery of what
we now call dark matter. We
don't know exactly

33:08.453 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it is yet. There is a lot
of ideas about
it, but we haven't seen it just
yet.

33:13.391 --> 33:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Vera Rubin was right there
at the beginning,
among the first female
astronomers, blazed

33:18.463 --> 33:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a trail for many others. And
many great astronomers
today really just stand on her
shoulders.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Miles O'Brien,
thanks so much for being here.

33:29.975 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Pleasure,
William.

33:35.680 --> 33:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: New York City
has many distinctions,
but one of its more dubious ones
is that it

33:42.420 --> 33:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has one of the most segregated
school systems
in the country.

33:46.057 --> 33:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schools with predominantly black
and brown
students fall way behind
majority white schools

33:50.495 --> 33:52.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in achievement levels.

33:52.464 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Charlayne Hunter-Gault,
in her regular series on
solutions to racism,

33:56.868 --> 34:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talks with a principal in the
Brownsville
section of Brooklyn who is
attempting to defy

34:00.872 --> 34:02.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the odds.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Nadia
Lopez, thank
you for joining us.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ, Principal, Mott
Hall Bridges
Academy: Thank you for having
me.

34:06.544 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
started a school
in one of the poorest and also
one of the

34:10.649 --> 34:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most violent areas of New York
City, Brownsville.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

34:16.054 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: Pretty much, the
Department of
Education decided that the area
of need was

34:20.258 --> 34:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brownsville, and my proposal fit
the bill.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What
kind of proposal
was it?

34:24.296 --> 34:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: My proposal really
was a STEM-focused
school at the time, science,
technology, engineering

34:28.533 --> 34:30.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and math.

34:30.535 --> 34:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I wanted to empower children
of color to
be represented in industries
that are under-represented

34:35.240 --> 34:36.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by people of color.

34:36.975 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
described
your early days at this school
as insane.

34:40.378 --> 34:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why? And how insane did it get?

34:42.547 --> 34:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: I literally had a
child set fire
to the bathroom. I would have
children choke

34:49.087 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other out, to the point
that the eyes
would start rolling back.

34:52.457 --> 34:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had parents come to my office,
put down
their bags and ready to fight
just because

34:58.797 --> 35:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they thought I might have said
something to
their child that was what they
considered

35:02.667 --> 35:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of pocket or inappropriate.
There was
challenges in terms of the
academics.

35:07.072 --> 35:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these children were made
to feel as
though they weren't going to
accomplish much.

35:14.813 --> 35:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, they came
from households
where parents weren't as
educated.

35:20.485 --> 35:24.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it started with the
children, and then
the parents soon feel in line,
but that took

35:24.823 --> 35:26.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hard work.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
also talked
about teachers that you had to
work with because

35:29.694 --> 35:31.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were not engaged.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: One of the things
that I had
to do with my teachers was to
actually walk

35:33.698 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them around the community for
them to see
what we're up against every
single day.

35:38.737 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, once my teachers were
able to see
it from the ground, by us
actually walking

35:44.009 --> 35:49.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the housing developments
and seeing
for themselves the lack of
employment, the

35:49.180 --> 35:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lack of resources, so many young
men who are
on the streets at 12:00, 1:00 in
the afternoon

35:55.086 --> 35:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are doing nothing, this is
drawing our
kids every single day.

35:58.690 --> 36:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when they leave us at 2:30
or 3:00 in
the afternoon, that's all they
know, to hang

36:03.862 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out on the streets and have no
other purpose.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So,
actually having
the teachers see where these
young people

36:09.367 --> 36:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come from helped them to be more
engaged?

36:11.970 --> 36:13.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NADIA LOPEZ: Yes.

36:13.705 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to start engaging in the
solutions
to combat what are the problems
that exist

36:18.710 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Brownsville. When you
sit with a child
who's been misbehaving, and they
talk about

36:24.883 --> 36:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the anger that they have had
since they were
6 because their father left, or
you speak

36:29.654 --> 36:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a child who themselves have
had children,
right, in middle school, or you
have a child

36:40.665 --> 36:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's competing with seven other
kids in a
household and they live in a
two-bedroom apartment,

36:45.403 --> 36:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, the judgment people pass
is like, well,
their parents could have made
better decisions.

36:52.343 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But lack of education, lack of
resources can
cause history to repeat itself.
And so, sometimes,

37:03.721 --> 37:07.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these children just need
somebody to listen
to them. Sometimes, they just
need a safe

37:07.258 --> 37:14.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
space where they can be
distracted with something
good, because all they see in
the media is

37:14.466 --> 37:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone like them dying. All
they know is
that prison is an option.

37:19.637 --> 37:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What, in
your experience,
is relevant and replicable in
other schools

37:26.945 --> 37:29.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the same situation as your
school is?

37:29.547 --> 37:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: I literally take
all of my sixth-graders.
Every single year, we walk over
the Brooklyn

37:34.519 --> 37:36.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bridge.

37:36.321 --> 37:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want them to understand that
there is a
connection between their past,
their present

37:39.491 --> 37:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their future. So, their past
is fifth
grade, their present is while
they're here

37:42.594 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us in middle school, but
their future
is, as we walk across this
bridge, seeing

37:46.798 --> 37:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what is lying ahead.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And
what's been some
of the experiences? Because you
have talked

37:50.802 --> 37:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fact that these kids
have never
been across a bridge. They grab
onto you.

37:54.906 --> 38:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: They do. They are
fearful. They
are fearful that the bridge will
collapse.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are fearful that they won't
make it over.

38:03.314 --> 38:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are some of the
toughest kids who
can be the most challenging, who
teachers

38:09.988 --> 38:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will say they are disrespectful
and will grab
onto a teacher and be like,
please don't let

38:13.191 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me fall.

38:15.059 --> 38:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have taken them to the South
Street Seaport,
and they just sit and watch the
water, because

38:21.833 --> 38:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have never just seen boats
or had opportunities
of just having that experience.

38:27.405 --> 38:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for hours, when I first
started doing
it as just a special needs
teacher, the kids

38:36.247 --> 38:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sat for two or three hours, and
it was the
most peaceful and serene scene
that you have

38:41.953 --> 38:43.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ever seen.

38:43.855 --> 38:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And shouldn't every child have
that opportunity
to not hear gunshots, to not
feel that they're

38:49.427 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not safe?

38:51.129 --> 38:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
do you think
the systemic solutions are to
this?

38:53.965 --> 38:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: First off, we need
to have a
conversation.

38:58.102 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people making
decisions
at the top, and they're not
willing to sit

39:02.574 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us in the trenches and look
in our classrooms
and ask the questions: What is
the challenge

39:08.780 --> 39:12.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here? What do you need?

39:12.884 --> 39:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our budgets aren't made for all
of the things
that they are asking us to do.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What's
at stake?

39:18.356 --> 39:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: If we don't show
up, then we
lose generations of children,
and we're just

39:23.061 --> 39:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeating what I often say is
generational
genocide, that when our children
aren't learning

39:29.067 --> 39:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in our classrooms, then
they can't teach
the next generation to be
better, they can't

39:33.938 --> 39:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teach them to aspire, to want
more.

39:36.541 --> 39:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we plant their feet
in the places
we want them to go. We take them
to high schools.

39:41.145 --> 39:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take them to colleges. We
bring people
in from the outside who have
various careers

39:46.651 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in industries that they're not
represented,
because when do those people
ever come to

39:50.355 --> 39:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brownsville and tell them their
stories?

39:53.758 --> 39:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the other thing that
we fail to
do. We fail to share our
stories. I think

39:58.429 --> 40:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was significant about mine
is that people
were like, here's this principal
who was about

40:04.035 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to quit because she said she
felt broken.

40:07.138 --> 40:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it got to a point where I
felt like I
couldn't be the superhero. I
can't act like

40:11.976 --> 40:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to show up to work
every single
day and this is easy and I can
do it.

40:16.781 --> 40:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No. I'm tired. And it's OK,
because all of
us hit that wall, right? And
what was resounding

40:25.757 --> 40:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the world, the world
said, education
is important and was willing to
step up and

40:33.931 --> 40:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, we want to help these
children.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm so grateful to that.

40:37.135 --> 40:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You said
in the book
that you were moved by the power
of education

40:42.240 --> 40:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to transform even the most
hardened students.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lesson there. There's
a solution.

40:49.714 --> 40:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: This community has
heard the
negative for so long.

40:53.685 --> 40:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What my team and I are doing is
combating
that. And every day, we're
telling them that

40:57.955 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they are Brownsville's
brilliance, that they
are those diamonds and they can
shine bright,

41:02.226 --> 41:05.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are scholars, they are
lifelong
learners.

41:05.163 --> 41:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're pouring into them the
positive that
they so deserve, so that they
can thrive.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Nadia Lopez,
thank you very much.

41:12.804 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NADIA LOPEZ: Well, thank you for
having me.

41:21.346 --> 41:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now our series
on some of
the best work in arts and
letters this year.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks back at a
big year in
television and video.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A new golden age
of television?

41:36.027 --> 41:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, these days, we talk more
of peak television,
and some wonder if there's now
simply too

41:40.798 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much TV, including too much
really good and
even great programming.

41:45.570 --> 41:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it comes at us from all
kinds of producers
and platforms, over the air,
cable, streaming.

41:51.242 --> 41:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's a consumer to do? What's
a television
critic to do?

41:54.345 --> 42:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked two of them to help us
look at the
best of 2016, Eric Deggans of
NPR, and Alan

42:00.618 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sepinwall the digital culture
site Uproxx.

42:04.021 --> 42:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to both of you. Good
luck in sorting
this out for all of us.

42:07.458 --> 42:08.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:08.459 --> 42:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eric, let me
start with you.

42:10.194 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Out of the hundreds of shows, we
asked you
to pick a few to just run
through and tell

42:14.065 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us about just to kick this off.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS, National Public
Radio: Sure.

42:17.335 --> 42:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I'm a sucker for new
programming.
All of my top five are new shows
this year,

42:22.173 --> 42:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Full Frontal With Samantha
Bee," "Daily Show"
alum who has a potent new show
about politics

42:28.212 --> 42:29.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on TBS.

42:29.981 --> 42:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"This Is Us" on NBC, a wonderful
new family
drama that really breaks the
boundaries of

42:34.819 --> 42:36.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drama on television.

42:36.554 --> 42:42.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"People V. O.J. Simpson:
American Crime Story,"
an amazing scripted retelling of
the O.J.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Simpson trial and verdict.

42:44.162 --> 42:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"O.J.: Made in America," a
five-part documentary
film made by ESPN about O.J.
Simpson as well,

42:52.270 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much more extensive than
"American Crime Story."

42:55.173 --> 43:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And "Atlanta" on FX, an amazing
drama featuring
three young men trying to make
it in Atlanta's

43:01.412 --> 43:03.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rap scene.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we're
going to come
back to that last one in more
depth, but,

43:04.849 --> 43:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first, Alan, your pick. Run
through it for
us.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL, Uproxx: All
right.

43:09.153 --> 43:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, like Eric, I really loved
the two O.J.
Shows and was kind of stunned
that the TV

43:12.790 --> 43:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event of the year wasn't one,
but two different
retellings of the O.J. Simpson
story, each

43:17.361 --> 43:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focusing on different and
exciting aspects
of it.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, who would
have thought
that, huh?

43:21.232 --> 43:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL: It's not even
like the 20th
anniversary. It just happened.
And it was

43:24.135 --> 43:26.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wonderful.

43:26.037 --> 43:30.741 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
There's a great
musical/comedy/drama/romance
on the CW called "Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend," co-created

43:30.775 --> 43:33.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by Rachel Bloom that's
delightful.

43:33.978 --> 43:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Atlanta," like Eric, I think
Donald Glover
did a marvelous entry into
television.

43:38.749 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the best new show of the
year and the
best show of the year, as far as
I was concerned,

43:42.954 --> 43:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is "Horace and Pete," which
turned up on Louis
C.K.'s Web site, of all places.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we're
going to come
back to that one.

43:48.659 --> 43:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, you both mentioned
"Atlanta."
Let's take a quick look at a
clip from that.

43:52.463 --> 43:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the main character,
Earn. He is managing
his cousin, who is a local
rapper.

43:57.568 --> 43:58.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's look at that.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Hello, cousin. How are
you today?

44:00.771 --> 44:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD GLOVER, Actor: Listen,
man, can you
do me a huge favor and put $20
in my account,

44:08.479 --> 44:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like for ASAP? Like, you got the
help me out,
man.

44:14.218 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: All right.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD GLOVER: Really? Thanks,
man. You're
saving my ass.

44:16.587 --> 44:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: OK, man. Well, you know,
I got to go
now.

44:18.723 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD GLOVER: OK. Cool. So,
what you guys
doing right now? You dudes do
that deal?

44:25.696 --> 44:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: I do not know what you
mean.

44:27.465 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so,
Eric, that's
the main character, who is
played by Donald

44:29.267 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glover, who is also the creator
and writer
of the series. What do you like
so much about

44:31.836 --> 44:33.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

44:33.571 --> 44:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS: What I love about
"Atlanta"
is that it talks about a lot of
different

44:36.240 --> 44:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things without really talking
about those
things.

44:38.943 --> 44:44.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We see these three young
brothers trying to
make it in Atlanta. You saw
Donald Glover's

44:44.715 --> 44:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earn Marks, who is an aspiring
rap manager.
He wants to manage his cousin,
who is an up-and-coming

44:49.420 --> 44:52.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rapper. And they have an odd
friend who is
sort of like a black version of
Kramer on

44:53.024 --> 44:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Seinfeld," and very eccentric,
and getting
into all kinds of adventures.

44:56.327 --> 45:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we see great stories
involving race and
class and difference told in a
way where it's

45:02.667 --> 45:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just kind of presented to you,
and, as a viewer,
you have to decide how you feel
about it.

45:06.704 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Alan,
you told us
about the show "Horace and
Pete." It's set

45:11.309 --> 45:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a dive bar in Brooklyn, I
think.

45:14.512 --> 45:19.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to look at a
quick clip here
to. This is a scene with Louis
C.K. and Steve

45:19.584 --> 45:21.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Buscemi.

45:21.385 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOUIS C.K., Actor: I'm actually
saying it's
because you're so good at your
job. That's

45:24.422 --> 45:26.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why I'm saying it.

45:26.190 --> 45:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like a pyramid of rags,
like you decided
to put a pyramid of rags here.
And you're

45:31.395 --> 45:35.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really good at closing. That's
why -- you
understand that that's like a
compliment?

45:35.333 --> 45:38.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm saying you're so good. Why
is that like
that? That's all.

45:38.903 --> 45:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, Alan, it's
part of this
new distribution, right, Louis
C.K. direct

45:43.374 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to his fans. Tell us a little
bit about that.

45:45.343 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL: I mean, the show
arrived without
warning. Just one Saturday at
the end of January,

45:49.213 --> 45:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Louis C.K. sent out an e-mail
saying, here's
my new show, "Horace and Pete."
Watch it here.

45:53.117 --> 45:54.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hope you like it.

45:54.885 --> 45:58.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had somehow in secret filmed
a show with
Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan
Alda, and

45:58.923 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jessica Lange. Nobody knew about
it. It just
appeared out of the ether.

46:02.526 --> 46:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, part of
this, what is
going on, clearly, is so much
great acting

46:07.465 --> 46:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talent. And we asked the two of
you to pick
one performance out of the many.

46:11.469 --> 46:13.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, I understand how
difficult this was.

46:14.005 --> 46:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Eric, you picked Sterling
Brown, who
appeared in two big series, the
O.J. drama

46:19.477 --> 46:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the NBC hit "This Is Us."

46:21.679 --> 46:25.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's take a look at him. Here
he is in the
latter, "This Is Us," in a
Christmas scene.

46:25.650 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STERLING BROWN, Actor: Hey. Did
William ever
mention Jesse?

46:29.754 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Not to me.

46:31.689 --> 46:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: I think it's a boy at
school.

46:35.226 --> 46:36.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STERLING BROWN: Whose?

46:36.227 --> 46:37.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: The one with two dads.

46:37.228 --> 46:38.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STERLING BROWN: What do you mean
two dads?

46:38.229 --> 46:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Dad, grandpa's gay, or
at least bi.

46:42.199 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Eric,
tell us about
Sterling Brown.

46:46.904 --> 46:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS: Well, what's
wonderful about
Sterling, in "This Is Us," he
plays a character

46:52.109 --> 46:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was adopted into a white
family, a black
man raised in a white family.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's been searching for his
biological
father. And he finds him and
welcomes him

46:59.917 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into his home, to find out that
he's dying.
And he had always thought that
no one knew

47:05.923 --> 47:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where his biological father was.
But he found
out that his adopted mother did
know and had

47:11.495 --> 47:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kept that from him for years.

47:13.264 --> 47:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a pivotal scene where
they have a
holiday dinner. The whole family
is there.

47:16.934 --> 47:21.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he begins to react to this
knowledge and
starts crying. And that just
shows you how

47:21.906 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real, how creative, how amazing
this actor
is.

47:25.776 --> 47:29.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that he appeared in
both this
show, which I think is the best
drama on network

47:29.914 --> 47:34.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television right now, and also
appeared in
"American Crime Story: The
People v. O.J.

47:34.285 --> 47:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simpson" story, playing Chris
Darden, the
prosecutor, that's an amazing
achievement

47:39.056 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for an actor. And he did a great
job in both
roles.

47:42.827 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alan, you picked
Phoebe Waller-Bridge
in the British comedy "Fleabag,"
which is

47:47.398 --> 47:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about a young woman negotiating
love and relationships.

47:50.234 --> 47:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take a quick look at a
clip from that.

47:52.269 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, Actress:
You know that
feeling when a guy you like
sends you a text

47:54.038 --> 47:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 2:00 on a Tuesday night
asking if he can
come and find you, and then you
open to the

47:55.339 --> 48:04.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door to him like you have almost
forgotten
he's coming over?

48:04.949 --> 48:06.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh, hi.

48:06.283 --> 48:07.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Hey.

48:07.618 --> 48:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Alan,
tell us about
this show.

48:12.156 --> 48:15.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALAN SEPINWALL: Phoebe
Waller-Bridge created
"Fleabag." She was adapting it
from a play

48:15.526 --> 48:17.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she had done.

48:17.228 --> 48:20.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has this remarkably
expressive face. And
often the best parts of the show
are just

48:20.931 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her turning to the camera and
not even saying
anything, just like widening her
eyes slightly

48:25.469 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to let you know how her
character is reacting
to all of these crazy or
degrading or downright

48:30.374 --> 48:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tragic things that are happening
to her.

48:32.443 --> 48:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it starts off as mainly sort
of a sex
farce and becomes something much
deeper and

48:36.514 --> 48:40.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much sadder and much more
profound. And she
-- I had never heard of her
this. And now

48:41.018 --> 48:43.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm going to want to see
everything she does.
She's a major talent.

48:43.454 --> 48:46.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, just
both of you,
in our last minute here, I
started off by

48:46.991 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about the renaissance or
the peak
television.

48:51.162 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What do you see, broadly
speaking, Eric, when
you look at the quantity vs.
quality? Where

48:56.367 --> 48:58.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are we today?

48:58.235 --> 49:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS: Well, what's
amazing about this
moment is not only do we have a
lot of quantity;

49:01.839 --> 49:07.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do have a lot of quality,
because that
quantity is coming from media
outlets or TV

49:07.478 --> 49:11.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outlets that are trying to build
their brand
by creating great television.

49:11.649 --> 49:17.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have Hulu. We have
Amazon. We have
Netflix. We even have Crackle, a
Web site

49:17.488 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has Jerry Seinfeld's
"Comedians in Cars"
about coffee, and now they're
doing scripted,

49:22.493 --> 49:24.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
original television.

49:24.228 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alan, last
question to you.
That's if you can find all those
programs,

49:28.199 --> 49:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, and figure out what you
want.

49:30.034 --> 49:33.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL: What's amazing
is, Uproxx,
we do this television critics
poll where we

49:33.637 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach out to about 60 TV critics
across the
country, including Eric, and we
ask them to

49:37.842 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
name their 10 favorite shows of
the year.

49:40.477 --> 49:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I get the ballots back, and
I haven't
even heard of some of these
shows, and it's

49:44.281 --> 49:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my job to watch television.
That's how much
great stuff is out there. It's
ridiculous.

49:49.887 --> 49:51.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

49:51.589 --> 49:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Sepinwall, go back the
watching, from
Uproxx, and, Eric Deggans, thank
you both

49:56.193 --> 49:57.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

49:57.995 --> 50:01.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On our
Facebook page, you
can find more of our TV critics'
recommendations.

50:01.265 --> 50:06.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus, tomorrow on the
"NewsHour," our best
of 2016 series continues, with
Washington

50:06.170 --> 50:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Post film critic Ann Hornaday
and Mike Sargent
of Pacifica Radio.

50:10.307 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff asked them about their
favorite films
of the year, including the
sci-fi movie "Arrival,"

50:14.578 --> 50:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and "Moonlight," directed by
Barry Jenkins.

50:16.313 --> 50:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY, Film Critic, The
Washington
Post: It's a very tender,
observant -- as

50:22.419 --> 50:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike said, it takes all the kind
of tropes
of a coming-of-age story and
turns them inside

50:27.791 --> 50:30.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out and makes them so intimate.

50:30.327 --> 50:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jenkins' kind of -- his
point of view
is just a little askance, it's a
little askew,

50:36.867 --> 50:40.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that you're not getting the
conventional
beats of a person's life. You're
getting the

50:40.571 --> 50:43.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in-between times, which are
sometimes even
more meaningful.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what do you
love about
"Arrival," Mike?

50:45.843 --> 50:49.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
The movie is in many ways like a
large "Twilight

50:49.847 --> 50:51.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zone" episode.

50:51.749 --> 50:58.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's beautifully shot. It's
beautifully
acted. The aliens are very
powerful and meaningful.

50:58.923 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't want to give too
much away, but
the way in which the aliens
communicate is

51:03.827 --> 51:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such in an imaginative -- and
it's just a
beautiful film that to me works
on every level.

51:12.169 --> 51:23.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There have
been questions
raised concerning our report
that aired last

51:23.113 --> 51:27.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night on a Greek inventor who is
developing
a device that purports to turn
water into

51:27.985 --> 51:31.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power without requiring
additional energy.

51:31.221 --> 51:35.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Despite a team of Greek
scientists praising
the research, and the inclusion
of an independent

51:35.125 --> 51:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientist dubious of the work,
the "NewsHour"
acknowledges that our reporting
of this segment

51:39.997 --> 51:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should have been more skeptical.

51:41.832 --> 51:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our reporting and research
should always ask
more questions and seek greater
insight. We

51:46.303 --> 51:51.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are examining each step in our
process, and
we apologize to our audience for
the lapses

51:51.108 --> 51:52.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this report.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "PBS NewsHour" is dedicated
to presenting
clear and thorough reporting on
developments

51:56.947 --> 52:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

we will be
following up with more reporting
on the important

52:00.951 --> 52:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Fisher, who died

her openness
about her own struggles with
bipolar disorder

52:36.120 --> 52:41.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and substance abuse. In response
to her death,
