00:06.406 --> 00:07.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: The
European Union orders Apple to
pay over $14

00:12.846 --> 00:18.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
billion in back taxes to
Ireland, after uncovering
what it calls a sweetheart deal
between the

00:18.819 --> 00:20.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
company and Dublin.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
a look at the ground game this
presidential

00:23.724 --> 00:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election -- how the candidates
are bring their
campaigns to key states and
voters.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And Iceland
struggles with a tourism
boom.

00:31.565 --> 00:37.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As curious crowds flock to the
country's breathtaking
landscapes, residents are
increasingly overwhelmed.

00:37.304 --> 00:42.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HALLDOR MAR, Resident of
Iceland: I'm about
to get booted out of my home
because of Airbnb.

00:42.309 --> 00:47.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm looking at maybe we have to
just move
abroad, and this is going to be
a tourist

00:47.247 --> 00:48.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

00:48.615 --> 00:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:58.225 --> 01:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This was primary day
in some states,
with two big-name Republican
senators working

01:08.201 --> 01:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hold onto their seats.

01:09.770 --> 01:15.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Arizona, John McCain
campaigned for a sixth
term one day after turning 80.

01:15.842 --> 01:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Florida, Marco Rubio
sought nomination
for a second term, after
dropping his presidential

01:20.580 --> 01:22.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bid.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also in Florida: Democratic
Congresswoman
Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced
Bernie Sanders

01:25.886 --> 01:27.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
backer Tim Canova.

01:27.821 --> 01:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good weather
sent thousands
more African migrants sailing
for Sicily today.

01:32.326 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Rivers of Independent
Television News
reports at least 11,000 people
have been rescued

01:37.064 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since Sunday.

01:38.999 --> 01:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: They have risked
everything to
get this far, and now their
desperation overwhelms

01:44.671 --> 01:46.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:46.540 --> 01:51.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some plunge into the water to
swim the last
few yards to safety.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many must have feared they would
never make
it.

01:54.514 --> 02:00.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This vessel was carrying more
than 500 migrants,
mostly from the Horn of Africa,
who had been

02:00.153 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
packed into this small boat
found drifting
13 miles off the coast of Libya.

02:05.826 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first off were dozens of
children who
might not fully appreciate the
change they

02:10.630 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were in.

02:12.132 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was thanks to a Spanish aid
agency that
they were plucked to safety.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They were really
desperate.

02:18.572 --> 02:24.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For us, it was really hard,
because what we
saw is basically many, many,
many children,

02:24.411 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many babies and a lot of women,
which is kind
of exceptional, because, in
general, there

02:32.219 --> 02:36.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are more men traveling than
women and children.

02:36.523 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them especially, this
crossing is really,
really difficult.

02:40.093 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: It shows how
desperate they are
when 5-day-old twins are found
aboard, born

02:46.233 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a migration, barely a week
old and already
homeless.

02:50.570 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
International Organization
for Migration reports more than
100,000 people

02:55.475 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have reached Italy by boat this
year.

02:57.544 --> 03:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 2,700 have died in the
attempt.

03:00.147 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Italy, grieving
survivors of
last week's earthquake paid
final respects

03:05.118 --> 03:06.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to loved ones today.

03:06.953 --> 03:12.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hundreds gathered at a
state-sponsored funeral
in Amatrice, where at least 231
people were

03:12.826 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
killed.

03:14.661 --> 03:19.399 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Firefighters and
first-responders stood along
caskets under makeshift tents as
family members

03:19.433 --> 03:20.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looked on.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, a mass was held, and
mourners released
white balloons.

03:23.703 --> 03:27.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
Islamic State
group's leading figures has been
killed in

03:27.674 --> 03:29.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northern Syria.

03:29.176 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The militants say Abu Muhammad
al-Adnani died
today in Aleppo province.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.S. defense official says he
was targeted
in an airstrike.

03:37.017 --> 03:41.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's the ISIS leader who
declared a modern-day
caliphate across Syria and Iraq
two years

03:41.354 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At least 10,000
people may have
died so far in Yemen's civil
war.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That estimate today from the
U.N. Humanitarian
Office is nearly double any
previous figure.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The fighting in Yemen has now
lasted 18 months.

03:55.202 --> 03:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In economic
news: France
joined Germany today in dousing
hopes for

03:59.039 --> 04:02.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a free trade deal between the
U.S. and the
European Union.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A top German official said
Sunday that negotiations
have failed.

04:05.312 --> 04:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, French President Francois
Hollande
added his skepticism in a speech
in Paris.

04:09.382 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): The negotiations
are bogged down.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Positions have not been
respected.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's clearly unbalanced.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, rather than prolonging
talks, it is better
to make sure that we can advise
all parties

04:21.928 --> 04:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that France will not be able to
agree on an
accord which has been prepared
that way.

04:26.366 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The potential
agreement
has run into growing opposition
in both the

04:29.636 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. and Europe.

04:31.204 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Britain's vote to leave the
E.U. has further
damaged prospects for a deal.

04:35.075 --> 04:40.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, President
Obama commuted the sentences of
another 111

04:40.313 --> 04:41.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal prison inmates.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That makes more than 670 during
his time in
office.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They'd been convicted of
nonviolent drug crimes.

04:48.054 --> 04:52.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has argued that
sentences in
such cases are too long, and
he's called for

04:52.425 --> 04:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
congressional action to lessen
the penalties.

04:54.728 --> 04:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And on Wall
Street, stocks
gave back some of Monday's
gains.

04:58.064 --> 05:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 48 points
to close at 18454.

05:02.235 --> 05:06.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nine points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped four.

05:06.039 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
tech giant Apple is ordered to
pay more than

05:10.644 --> 05:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$14 billion in back taxes to
Ireland; mass
graves are uncovered as ISIS
loses ground;

05:18.285 --> 05:26.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teaching teachers about the
communities they
serve; and much more.

05:26.059 --> 05:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The European
Commission
ruled today that Ireland must
collect $14.5

05:38.939 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
billion in back taxes from
Apple.

05:41.608 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement fueled new
tensions between
the U.S. and Europe over the
role of multinational

05:46.046 --> 05:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporations, how they are
taxed, and whether
it should be considered a
subsidy.

05:50.717 --> 05:55.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The antitrust regulator for the
E.U. said
Ireland had given Apple a
sweetheart tax deal

05:55.622 --> 06:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for well over a decade, with
special laws
that effectively allowed Apple
to pay less

06:00.827 --> 06:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 1 percent corporate tax.

06:03.330 --> 06:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. accused Apple of
setting up two companies
in Ireland with a head office
that only exists

06:08.835 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on paper.

06:10.604 --> 06:14.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The profits from European stores
all go to
the Ireland head office and are
essentially

06:15.008 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
untaxed.

06:16.509 --> 06:20.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Apple said it would appeal the
decision and
denied the characterization.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the company's
chief executive,
Tim Cook, said the European
commission is

06:23.283 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to -- quote -- "rewrite
Apple's history
in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax
laws and upend

06:29.122 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the international tax system in
the process."

06:31.858 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company has more than $200
billion in
cash.

06:35.328 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with Commissioner
Margrethe Vestager,
who announced the decision.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Vestager, thanks for joining
us.

06:41.268 --> 06:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First off, what gave Apple an
edge in Ireland
that was unfair in the eyes of
the E.U.?

06:47.507 --> 06:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER, European
Commission: Well,
we have a long longstanding
prohibition of

06:52.512 --> 06:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state aid, which means benefits,
advantages
to a selected company.

06:58.385 --> 07:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that may come in any form,
as a piece
of land, a favorable loan, a
grant or a tax

07:04.457 --> 07:05.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
benefit.

07:05.825 --> 07:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, any member state
can have
their own tax legislation.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We would never question that.

07:11.431 --> 07:16.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing is that you cannot
give a specific
company a benefit or an
advantage which is

07:17.003 --> 07:18.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not open to other companies.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
evidence that this
was specific to Apple and not to
all the other

07:22.809 --> 07:25.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
companies that are doing
business in Ireland?

07:25.145 --> 07:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes, it is.

07:27.981 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This arrangement is due to two
things which
are none of our concern, how
Apple is organized

07:36.256 --> 07:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Irish tax legislation.

07:38.591 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing that is specific
is two tax
rulings -- are two tax rulings
that are directed

07:45.365 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
specifically to Apple.

07:47.233 --> 07:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tax rulings are, by nature,
specific because
they are directed from the
government or from

07:53.673 --> 07:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the authorities to a specific
company.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is only for them.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is not for other companies.

08:00.647 --> 08:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of Apple's
concerns
today, in a call with reporters,
the CFO said

08:05.785 --> 08:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the .005 percent effective tax
rate that you
cited this morning during your
press conference,

08:10.523 --> 08:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they said that -- "I said it
before.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a completely made-up
number.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We paid $400 million of taxes in
Ireland during
2014.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're one of the largest
taxpayers in the
country."

08:19.699 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, the
thing is that
it is important for profits to
be paid where

08:25.772 --> 08:27.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
profits are made.

08:27.941 --> 08:37.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we have seen is that
the Irish tax
rulings allowed Apple to put the
huge majority

08:37.217 --> 08:42.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of their profits into a
so-called headquarter
or head office.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This head office only existed on
paper.

08:45.091 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It had no employees, no
premises, no real
activities, and it wasn't taxed,
not in Ireland,

08:52.999 --> 08:54.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nor anywhere else.

08:54.734 --> 09:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, of course, then led to
the result
that Apple paid very, very, very
little in

09:00.473 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes compared to their profits,
in some years,
as little as 0.005 percent.

09:06.846 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this part
of a broader
effort to redefine how
multinational corporations

09:14.020 --> 09:15.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay taxes?

09:15.655 --> 09:18.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard that you're also
going after
McDonald's and reportedly
Amazon?

09:18.191 --> 09:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, the
thing is that
I do state aid control, and
state aid control

09:23.797 --> 09:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not redefine taxation as
such.

09:26.099 --> 09:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, of course, takes the
legislature to
work.

09:30.270 --> 09:36.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why we have worked
with the European
Council, with the European
Parliament in order

09:36.042 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to change legislation, to make
transparency
greater, to have
country-by-country reporting,

09:45.418 --> 09:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for tax authorities actually to
know what
other tax authorities are doing.

09:49.989 --> 09:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is for the legislature to
change that.

09:53.726 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I do is what we have a
longstanding tradition
of doing and a longstanding
court practice

09:59.432 --> 10:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of doing, which is to control
state aid seen
as specific advantages to
specific companies.

10:06.105 --> 10:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Doesn't this
draw into conflict
the role of the European Union
or the Commission

10:11.411 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vs. countries and their
sovereignty and how
they're able to lay out their
tax laws?

10:16.115 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, the
sovereignty
of the member state is protected
by our treaty.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I, of course, respect that
100 percent.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have sworn to respect the
treaty.

10:26.893 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing is that two things
have to be
in place at the same time, both
upholding

10:32.065 --> 10:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national legislation as tax
legislation and,
at the same time, the European
legislation

10:38.204 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have made in common,
that -- the E.U.
state aid rules.

10:42.075 --> 10:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here we have a situation
where you have
Irish states -- Irish tax
legislation, but

10:48.281 --> 10:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a breach of European state aid
rules, because
illegal state aid was handed
out.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the
record, we did invite
Apple.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't have anybody
available today.

10:58.091 --> 11:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they did say in a statement
that this
could have a profound and
harmful effect on

11:02.595 --> 11:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investment and job creation in
Europe.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They employ about 6,000 people
in Ireland.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you expect that?

11:08.368 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, the
thing is that
Europe is a wonderful place to
do business.

11:12.205 --> 11:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a single market with more
than 500 million
potential customers.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a place where you find
research and development
of highest quality.

11:20.914 --> 11:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You find very skilled people,
good people
to employ, wonderful
infrastructure.

11:26.185 --> 11:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you're more than welcome to
come to Europe
to do business.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you can have a very
good business
here.

11:32.992 --> 11:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing is that what we don't
like so much
is if you come to Europe for tax
avoidance.

11:37.163 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
concern that
this is -- the uncertainty
between how the

11:43.002 --> 11:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.U. rules on different laws
inside member
nations could create a climate
where a company

11:48.775 --> 11:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might not come to Europe; they
might base
themselves somewhere else?

11:51.778 --> 11:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: I think
there is an issue
here also of corporate culture,
because, if

11:58.351 --> 12:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're in a country where the
tax rate is
12.5 percent, as in Ireland, and
you pay less

12:03.756 --> 12:09.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than 1 percent, also
substantially less than
1 percent, well, then I think
you should also

12:09.696 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reconsider if everything is all
right.

12:13.032 --> 12:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 12.5 percent is, in the
first place, a
very low corporate taxation
compared to other

12:18.104 --> 12:19.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
European member states.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margrethe
Vestager, thanks
so much for joining us.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER: It was a
pleasure.

12:23.142 --> 12:28.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for having me.

12:28.247 --> 12:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cataloging the
atrocities committed
by the so-called Islamic State
group in Syria

12:41.127 --> 12:44.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Iraq is a difficult,
sometimes impossible
task.

12:44.731 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new report from the Associated
Press attempts
to document the mass graves
holding some of

12:50.069 --> 12:51.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the group's victims.

12:51.504 --> 12:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The AP found 72 mass grave sites
around Syria
and Iraq.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the sites held as many as
1,700 bodies.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, we are joined by
Associated Press
reporter Lori Hinnant, one of
the authors

13:04.317 --> 13:05.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the investigation.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lori, thank you for joining us.

13:07.954 --> 13:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventy-two mass grave sites,
how were you
and your colleagues able to find
them and

13:12.859 --> 13:14.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
document them?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI HINNANT, Associated Press:
Well, we used
a variety of sources.

13:16.262 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We first went to Iraqi
Kurdistan, where there
are at least 35 mass graves on
Sinjar Mountain

13:23.770 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone, most of them holding the
bodies of
minority Yazidi.

13:27.874 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also talked to the Kurdish
regional government,
who told us of at least two
others, one outside

13:35.381 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul at a prison, where 600 to
800 inmates
were killed, and another in a
deep natural

13:42.355 --> 13:44.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
geological pit.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we asked the government in
Baghdad what
they knew to try and triangulate
some of the

13:48.327 --> 13:49.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other information.

13:49.829 --> 13:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also went into archives of
news reports
when sites were discovered.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For Syria, we can't go in.

13:56.502 --> 14:02.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we had to speak to
activists, locals,
some fighters who are fighting
against Islamic

14:02.942 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State, and people who are trying
to document
human rights abuses.

14:05.211 --> 14:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do mass graves also
-- always
mean mass killings?

14:10.149 --> 14:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is to say, did all of the
people -- or
the bodies that you found in
these graves

14:14.420 --> 14:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all come from single episodes,
single assaults?

14:17.724 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: Not necessarily,
although, largely,
they did.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even for some of them, it's
not clear
who is even in them.

14:24.897 --> 14:28.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The graves have not been
excavated and they
are untouched.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others are in territory that no
one has seen.

14:31.304 --> 14:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pit outside Mosul and
another one in Syria,
for example, we know from
Islamic State's

14:37.009 --> 14:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own propaganda that they have
buried hundreds,
if not more, bodies in them.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they just tossed them in
really without
a thought.

14:44.650 --> 14:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have no idea why the people
were killed
exactly or when.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in those cases, yes, the
victims are killed
at different times.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Sinjar, they were all killed
at the same
time.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do we know how they
were killed?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are we talking about gunshots?

14:57.663 --> 15:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we talking about sometimes
in some cases
illness?

15:00.133 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: Illness seems
unlikely.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's mostly gunshots.

15:04.103 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The assault on Sinjar, for
example, it was
some gunshots.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some people were beheaded.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A few were run over by cars.

15:11.611 --> 15:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the site that holds the
bodies of about
1,700 Iraqi soldiers, they were
all gunned

15:18.217 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down after being forced to lie
down on the
ground.

15:21.254 --> 15:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Same with the Shiite prisoners
of the prison
in Mosul.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You said that, in
Syria, it was
difficult to physically get to
the actual

15:29.862 --> 15:31.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grave sites.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then how were you able to
document what happened?

15:33.366 --> 15:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: Well, what we did
was, we relied
on multiple sources.

15:36.836 --> 15:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we didn't just wait for one
person to
say, we think there is a mass
grave here.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tried to find a variety of
sources, including
locals.

15:45.444 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people sent us photos,
which we could
help by geolocating and by
coordinating with

15:50.850 --> 15:52.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what Islamic State's own
propaganda says.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have made no effort to hide
what they're
doing.

15:55.054 --> 15:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Can the bodies that
are then retrieved,
or are they being retrieved, can
they be identified?

15:59.992 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: Well, that's the
complicated
part right now, that they
largely aren't being

16:03.930 --> 16:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retrieved, for a variety of
reasons, a want
of money, want of political
will, and very,

16:10.169 --> 16:11.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very unstable areas.

16:12.004 --> 16:16.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sinjar Mountain, although it's
been largely
taken back from Islamic State,
still remains

16:16.108 --> 16:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a part of it inside a no-man's
land within
reach of mortars.

16:19.912 --> 16:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the sites are believed
to be booby-trapped
and are too unsafe to go in to.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bodies in some cases have
been identified.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Relatives can find personal
belongings.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can sometimes even find
I.D.s.

16:33.492 --> 16:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a center in the
city of Dohuk
where they are keeping some of
these belongings,

16:38.531 --> 16:42.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in hope of finding other
survivors who might
be able to say who they were.

16:42.702 --> 16:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has anyone ever been
charged or
jailed or in any way punished
for these deaths?

16:48.374 --> 16:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: There has been
justice done
in one case, quite recently
actually, in the

16:53.346 --> 16:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death at Camp Speicher of the
1,700 Iraqi
soldiers.

16:58.150 --> 17:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just on August 21, 36 men were
hanged who
had been convicted in those
killings.

17:03.389 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As part of this
investigation,
Lori, and you talked to people
who were survivors

17:07.693 --> 17:09.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or witnesses.

17:09.495 --> 17:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were you able to talk to any of
the relatives
of people who think that their
loved ones

17:12.265 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might be in one of these graves?

17:13.499 --> 17:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORI HINNANT: We did.

17:15.268 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At one point, we went to an area
just outside
the town of Hardan, Iraq, and we
met a man

17:20.539 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there who originally was just
there to tell
us about the graves.

17:24.644 --> 17:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of the leaders of the
village,
and he wanted to tell us about
the graves

17:29.682 --> 17:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how much they wished that
they would be
excavated and that the people
who were buried

17:33.219 --> 17:35.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in there would get a proper
burial.

17:35.121 --> 17:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it took some time before he
finally acknowledged
that, in fact, two of his adult
sons were

17:40.226 --> 17:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among the victims of that
killing.

17:42.161 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after a little while, he and
I talked
for a bit longer, and he invited
another young

17:46.732 --> 17:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man down from the hillside town
just above
where the killings had taken
place, and said

17:51.671 --> 17:54.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he actually saw the killings.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turned out that the young man
whose name was
Arkon (ph) had never spoken with
the father

17:58.811 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what happened the day his
two sons were
-- died.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was really chilling.

18:03.616 --> 18:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we were standing there, the
two men discussed
the events of this horrific day
that they

18:09.588 --> 18:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel as though they're reliving
every single
day that they pass the grave.

18:13.592 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Will this father
ever be able
to retrieve the bodies of his
sons?

18:17.163 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORI HINNANT: He hopes to.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He sounded very resigned to it.

18:20.800 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said he wanted the
international community
to understand that they couldn't
keep reliving

18:26.772 --> 18:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the sorrow all of the time.

18:28.607 --> 18:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All he wanted was a proper place
for his sons
to be laid to rest.

18:32.979 --> 18:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lori Hinnant of the
Associated
Press, thank you very much.

18:36.215 --> 18:41.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORI HINNANT: Thank you.

18:41.420 --> 18:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

18:51.130 --> 18:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
gap in the
presidential candidates' ground
game; and

18:55.868 --> 19:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why Icelanders want tourists to
stop coming
to their island nation.

19:00.639 --> 19:05.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first: Urban school
districts are tough
places to be a teacher, but also
where the

19:06.012 --> 19:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best and the brightest are
needed the most.

19:08.247 --> 19:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Chicago, which is dealing
with one of the
worst budget crises in years,
recruiting and

19:13.085 --> 19:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holding on to good teachers is
an uphill battle.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The district also faces a common
dilemma.

19:18.891 --> 19:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even as the student body is
growing more diverse,
the teaching profession is not.

19:23.229 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One university teacher training
program is
trying to step up to the
challenge.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Stark of Education Week has
the story.

19:30.503 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's summer in the
city of Chicago,
the nation's third largest
public school district.

19:38.677 --> 19:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these aspiring teachers are
getting to
know each other, the first step
in an intensive

19:45.751 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summer fellowship to prepare
them to teach
in urban schools.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I want to be a teacher in
Chicago Public
Schools.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Because I think I can
make a really
big difference.

19:55.461 --> 19:59.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: And make sure other
students who come
from backgrounds like myself get
these opportunities.

19:59.298 --> 20:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: These fellows, 21 of
them, are
all students at Illinois State
University,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
training to be teachers.

20:07.039 --> 20:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have high hopes, but most,
like Morgan
Brauer, have little or no
experience in the

20:12.411 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inner city.

20:14.814 --> 20:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We first met Morgan the day
before, at her
home about an hour away.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell me about this neighborhood,
how you grew
up?

20:21.353 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORGAN BRAUER, Student, Illinois
State University:
So, I'm from the suburbs of
Chicago, Rolling

20:24.957 --> 20:26.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Meadows specifically.

20:26.692 --> 20:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Morgan typifies
America's teaching
force, mostly white, mostly
female.

20:32.498 --> 20:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORGAN BRAUER: I grew up, it's
everyone basically
goes to college.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is not really like any
question.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, I was going to college.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That was that.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's kind of why I
want to teach
in Chicago Public Schools, is
because they

20:46.479 --> 20:50.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
don't have the same
opportunities that I did
growing up in the suburbs.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's just going to be a new
experience.

20:54.553 --> 20:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: This morning, Morgan
is leaving
for this unique teaching
fellowship that takes

20:59.458 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her out of Rolling Meadows for a
new home
in Auburn Gresham, a
predominantly African-American

21:06.432 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community on Chicago's South
Side, one of
four neighborhoods fellows are
placed in for

21:12.538 --> 21:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one month, all with high-poverty
schools,
many with high crime rates as
well.

21:23.282 --> 21:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a nonstop four weeks,
assisting in the
classroom in the morning,
volunteering in

21:30.656 --> 21:32.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the afternoon.

21:32.858 --> 21:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Classes and seminars fill
evenings and weekends,
all to help them appreciate and
understand

21:43.202 --> 21:45.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the culture of these
communities.

21:45.471 --> 21:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LEE, STEP-UP, Illinois
State University:
And they hope that, when this is
all finished,

21:49.208 --> 21:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you come back and become a
teacher for
their community.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Robert Lee runs this
fellowship,
called STEP-UP.

21:55.514 --> 22:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LEE: This infusion, this
allowing candidates
to experience firsthand and
start to confront

22:02.087 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their -- their own race, their
own class,
their own sources of privilege,
leads to a

22:07.927 --> 22:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much stronger teacher when they
enter the
field.

22:10.563 --> 22:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Only 7 years old,
with 144 participants
so far, it's a small program,
but one that

22:17.803 --> 22:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
takes enormous effort, including
finding funding,
about $8,000 a fellow.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LEE: That's where the
challenge is
going to be.

22:25.678 --> 22:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Virtually every
teacher college
requires so-called cultural
competency training,

22:30.783 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Professor Carol Lee says
many programs
come up short.

22:35.221 --> 22:39.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAROL LEE, Northeastern
University: The notion
of cultural competence is often
pitched as

22:39.792 --> 22:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something special you need to
know if you're
working with colored kids.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm saying, I don't care
where you're
teaching.

22:48.901 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cultural competence means
that I have
to go into that community with
the humility

22:56.175 --> 22:57.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in order to learn.

22:57.943 --> 23:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: One of the key ways
that STEP-UP
fellows learn is from the host
families.

23:04.550 --> 23:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yolanda Smith will provide
Morgan meals and
a place to sleep, but, most
importantly, lessons

23:12.558 --> 23:16.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that can't be taught in the
classroom.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you hope Morgan leaves
this neighborhood
with?

23:19.131 --> 23:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YOLANDA SMITH, Host Mom: Just to
learn about
us, and don't believe the hype.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: What is the hype, in
your view?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOLANDA SMITH: That we're
shiftless and violent.

23:28.807 --> 23:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just want us -- want her
to see the
human side of us, not what is
portrayed on

23:34.480 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the media.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We're so thankful that
you're watching
over her while she's here.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOLANDA SMITH: I sure do, me and
God.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Not all of the
fellows are from
the suburbs.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Asia-Ana Williams grew up in
Chicago.

23:46.692 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASIA-ANA WILLIAMS, Student,
Illinois State
University: I'm, like, a little
nervous.

23:50.362 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to be my first
time teaching,
so I don't know how I will do.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's, like, scary to think
about.

23:58.003 --> 24:02.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Asia-ana was
recruited by Illinois
State while in high school as
part of an effort

24:02.174 --> 24:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to encourage students of color
to become teachers.

24:05.077 --> 24:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASIA-ANA WILLIAMS: I want to
come home to
students who look just like me,
who have been

24:10.015 --> 24:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through things just like I have,
and help
them the way my teachers helped
me.

24:14.186 --> 24:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: She too is in an
unfamiliar neighborhood,
the largely Hispanic community
of Little Village.

24:24.263 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't take her long to feel
at home.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This is really good, so try
it.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAMS: My host family can't
get rid of
me now.

24:34.039 --> 24:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, I love them too much.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, they're pretty much stuck
with me.

24:37.710 --> 24:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: The Velazco family
has taken in
fellows since the STEP-UP
program began seven

24:43.415 --> 24:44.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

24:44.783 --> 24:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you tell these student
teachers who
come to your house?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY VELAZCO, Host Dad: Not to
have the savior
mentality.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not coming in here to
save people.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're here to be part of the
community.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they really have to get to
know where
the kids are coming from in
order to be able

24:59.031 --> 25:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to teach them better, to reach
them, to inspire
them.

LISA STARK: Finding host
families and local
schools is done with the support
of community

25:10.409 --> 25:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups, such as the one run by
Carlos Nelson
in Auburn Gresham.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARLOS NELSON, Greater
Auburn-Gresham Development
Corporation: The teachers in our
schools have

25:18.584 --> 25:20.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daunting tasks.

25:20.119 --> 25:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's way beyond just being
able to teach
kids math and reading.

25:24.623 --> 25:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're also having to deal
with social,
emotional challenges, kids that
haven't had

25:29.361 --> 25:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a full night's sleep, that
haven't had a full
meal.

25:32.431 --> 25:38.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we need to
prepare educators
to be more in tune with teaching
the kids

25:38.937 --> 25:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in our South Side community.

25:44.443 --> 25:56.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: The hope with a
program like this
one is that, if teachers are
truly trained

25:56.989 --> 26:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to teach in urban schools, not
only will they
take jobs here, but they will
stay.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANESSA PUENTES HERNANDEZ,
Assistant Principal,
Farragut Career Academy: Hey,
guys, what's

26:05.097 --> 26:06.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up?

26:06.832 --> 26:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Assistant Principal
Vanessa Puentes
Hernandez, who has worked in the
district

26:08.400 --> 26:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a decade, has seen teachers
come and go.

26:12.104 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turnover in some Chicago schools
is as high
as 50 percent over four years.

26:17.509 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VANESSA PUENTES HERNANDEZ: It
takes a village.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It really does.

26:20.779 --> 26:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's important to learn
about the community
that you work in, because you
want to be invested

26:25.451 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that, not as an outsider
coming in and
maybe gaining some experience
and leaving,

26:30.422 --> 26:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but as someone who truly wants
to create change.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: That's a lot of work.

26:35.027 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a sacrifice.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It really is.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANESSA PUENTES HERNANDEZ: They
care so much
about their community.

26:39.331 --> 26:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of sad to see like how
much effort
they're kind of putting in, and
they still

26:45.504 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get seen in such negative
lighting.

26:48.774 --> 26:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Most of STEP-UP's
graduates end
up in Chicago or other high-need
schools.

26:57.749 --> 27:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And over 80 percent are still in
the classroom
after five years.

27:02.588 --> 27:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASIA-ANA WILLIAMS: We all came
from so many
different backgrounds, but I
think that the

27:08.160 --> 27:12.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
common ground was always that we
all wanted
to be good teachers.

27:12.731 --> 27:17.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These schools deserve good
teachers, just
like any other school district.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: And you want to be
one of them?

27:19.204 --> 27:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASIA-ANA WILLIAMS: And I want to
be one of
them.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I am going to be one of
them.

27:22.341 --> 27:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And with the help of
this program,
she's likely to have some
company.

27:32.184 --> 27:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporting from Chicago, I'm Lisa
Stark of
Education Week for the "PBS
NewsHour."

HARI SREENIVASAN: Turning now to
politics:
How much have team Clinton and
team Trump

27:47.766 --> 27:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Turning now to
politics:
How much have team Clinton and
team Trump

27:54.907 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invested in their on-the-ground
outreach,
their ground games, if you will,
to get their

27:59.978 --> 28:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supporters out to the polls this
fall?

28:02.614 --> 28:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
and digital
politics editor Daniel Bush
tackle that in

28:05.784 --> 28:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their new piece out today on our
"NewsHour"
Web site.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Lisa joins me now.

28:09.988 --> 28:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you went out to different
campaign facilities,
offices out in these key states.

28:14.660 --> 28:15.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

28:15.994 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
difference when
you go into them?

28:17.829 --> 28:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is an
important difference,
because now we're in the crucial
last two

28:20.465 --> 28:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months of this campaign.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The map, I think, tells the
story the best.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this wasn't easy to
pinpoint.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's look at the Trump
campaign offices.

28:28.206 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He right now has 88 offices in
key battleground
states, the states that pretty
much will decide

28:33.412 --> 28:34.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look at those circles.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They indicate how many offices
are in that
state.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, the bigger
the circle,
the more offices, yes?

28:39.084 --> 28:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Exactly.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now let's look
at the Clinton
map.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You see a very stark difference
there.

28:43.922 --> 28:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has more than three
times as many
offices as Donald Trump right
now going into

28:49.227 --> 28:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Labor Day, the traditional start
of the presidential
campaign season.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, one thing I have to note,
the Donald
Trump campaign says more coming.

28:56.201 --> 29:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say about over 100 are
going to come
online in the next week, but
they're not open

29:00.105 --> 29:01.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is especially a problem
for them
in some key states.

29:03.875 --> 29:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at four key states
where we know
things could be decisive,
Florida, North Carolina,

29:09.314 --> 29:11.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ohio, Pennsylvania.

29:11.049 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Donald Trump has just
20 offices
in those four mega-states,
Hillary Clinton

29:15.554 --> 29:16.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
136.

29:16.688 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari, Florida, we know, has been
decisive
in the past.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a great example here.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump right now just has
one office
open there.

29:23.929 --> 29:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, one of the
questions
would be, well, how important
are those offices?

29:28.166 --> 29:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the work that happens at
those offices?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And does it matter in this
election?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why should we care about the
ground game?

29:36.274 --> 29:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It seems like inside politics.

29:38.110 --> 29:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ground game has decided at
least the last
two elections, maybe going back
farther to

29:43.915 --> 29:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even George W. Bush as well.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Traditionally, it is critical.

29:47.219 --> 29:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the places where
volunteers identify
and actually sway voters.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Phone banks happen there,
canvassing operations.

29:54.559 --> 29:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is kind of the breathing
heart of usual
campaigns.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, it doesn't matter this
year.

29:59.765 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign says, no,
that they have
an operation that defies
convention, that

30:04.236 --> 30:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they like that, they don't need
as many on-the-ground
offices.

30:07.906 --> 30:13.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say, instead, their
groundswell of support
is a different type of campaign,
and they

30:13.445 --> 30:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that this traditional type
of tactic
is something they don't need as
much as other

30:18.316 --> 30:19.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaigns.

30:19.718 --> 30:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And they're
also saying
they're going mobile.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got some R.V.s,
instead of fixed
locations.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the Trump campaign has
had a resource
problem up until now.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have now started raising
money, but haven't
had funds until now.

30:29.661 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One way they have been dealing
with this is
they have launched mobile R.V.s
in the state

30:34.366 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Florida.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they have one office
there, but
they have got three R.V.s
cruising around

30:38.704 --> 30:39.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

30:39.971 --> 30:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say what they want to
do is reach
out to voters.

30:42.774 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if they don't have these
canvassing and
phone bank operations to the
extent that Clinton

30:46.578 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does, they say they want to go
to grocery
stores and register voters.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are they
trying to reinvent
this process?

30:52.718 --> 30:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They say they
are, but I
think it remains to be seen on
whether they

30:57.856 --> 30:59.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do that or not.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I say, they haven't had a lot
of resources
until now.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have just had a good
fund-raising month
in the last month.

31:05.664 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to see how they spend
those resources.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the data game really is what
reinvented
things with team Obama.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:13.038 --> 31:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have see if the Trump
campaign, do
they use digital, or do they --
how do they

31:16.441 --> 31:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get this groundswell of support
to show up
at the polls?

31:19.444 --> 31:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's especially a concern not
just for Trump,
Clinton, but for down-ballot
races.

31:23.849 --> 31:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These campaign offices are the
heartbeat of
pumping out voters not just for
Donald Trump,

31:27.919 --> 31:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but for every Republican on the
ballot.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's something the entire
party is watching.

31:32.157 --> 31:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With all of
this, even with
the lopsided 3-1
advantage-disadvantage, Trump

31:38.130 --> 31:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters are going to say,
he's been pretty
successful so far, he's our guy,
and he didn't

31:42.534 --> 31:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do anything by the book going
into this.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, and may be
right.

31:46.505 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's put relatively few
resources, not that
much work into these states, and
he's not

31:50.275 --> 31:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that far behind in a lot of the
key states,
in fact, tied in places like
Nevada, just

31:54.179 --> 31:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind by four or five points,
closing the
gap in some other states like
Michigan, without

31:58.250 --> 31:59.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
having to do too much.

32:00.018 --> 32:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The danger for Donald Trump is,
should he
come close to Election Day and
have sort of

32:04.556 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wobble on the campaign trail,
have a moment
where voters are in doubt, he
doesn't have

32:09.294 --> 32:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this campaign infrastructure to
fall back
on.

32:11.897 --> 32:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a bit of a gamble, but
the Trump campaign
says, hey, we like how we're
doing without

32:15.834 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all this spending.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, you
can read
the full report online at
NewsHour.org by

32:19.638 --> 32:21.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa and Dan.

32:21.473 --> 32:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, thanks for joining us.

32:26.711 --> 32:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

32:30.882 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The tourist season
in Europe is
winding down, and at least one
nation hopes

32:38.757 --> 32:40.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will stay that way.

32:40.826 --> 32:45.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iceland was one of this year's
it destinations
for vacationers, but people
there are learning

32:45.697 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the downside of that boom.

32:47.866 --> 32:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More tourist money can also mean
more problems.

32:51.570 --> 32:56.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
our story.

32:56.575 --> 33:10.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: With its
volcanic underbelly
and unspoiled prehistoric
landscape, Iceland

33:10.055 --> 33:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has suddenly become one of the
hottest destinations.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLOF YRR ATLADOTTIR, Director
General, Icelandic
Tourist Board: My name is Olof
Yrr Atladottir.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm the director general of
the Icelandic
Tourist Board.

33:19.731 --> 33:27.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For me, Iceland is the
possibility of enjoying
solitude in spectacular
wide-open spaces.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Iceland is
certainly spectacular.

33:30.475 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Gullfoss Waterfall, part of
the so-called
Golden Circle of attractions not
far from

33:36.047 --> 33:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the capital, is said by some to
rival Niagara
Falls.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not surrounded by
high-rise hotels.

33:42.954 --> 33:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But can you get solitude?

33:45.690 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's debatable.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iceland is a location for "Game
of Thrones."

33:48.894 --> 33:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fans of the hit series are
partly responsible
for the island's new popularity,
so much so,

33:55.200 --> 34:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's difficult to grab a
shot of pure
nature without getting
photo-bombed by people

34:00.872 --> 34:02.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taking selfies.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK HEASMAN, Charity Director:
My name is
Mark Heasman.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I run a children's charity in
London.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a delightful country.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So far, we have been in
Reykjavik.

34:08.613 --> 34:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're now just about to go
out on a three-week
expedition around the interior,
so we can't

34:12.417 --> 34:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wait to get away from the
people.

34:14.286 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We met Heasman
in the Thingvellir
National Park, another
destination on the

34:19.024 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Golden Circle route.

34:21.226 --> 34:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a World Heritage Site and
place of great
national importance to
Icelanders as a legendary

34:26.932 --> 34:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting point throughout the
centuries.

34:28.967 --> 34:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK HEASMAN: This particular
point seems
really crowded, actually, for
somewhere that's

34:33.004 --> 34:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so special and so unique.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's actually a bit
disappointing to see it
full of tourists.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then people need to see it,
I guess.

34:40.645 --> 34:43.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Fishing used to
be Iceland's
most important industry.

34:43.615 --> 34:49.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's now been overtaken by
tourism, which
accounts for a third of all of
the country's

34:49.688 --> 34:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foreign currency earnings.

34:51.589 --> 34:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2010, there's been between
a 25 percent
to 30 percent increase in the
number of visitors

34:57.228 --> 34:58.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each year.

34:58.897 --> 35:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, this year, 2016, looks
like being
a record season, with government
agencies

35:04.169 --> 35:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
predicting 1.8 million arrivals.

35:05.770 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN SYKES, Resident of Iceland:
My name is
Ian Sykes.

35:10.008 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a retired lecturer in
hospitality and
tourism from Scotland.

35:14.179 --> 35:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I now live in Iceland just
outside Reykjavik
with my wife.

35:18.683 --> 35:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I run a guest house here.

35:20.752 --> 35:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe Iceland really needs
to get a grip
of tourism.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Get a hold of it.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if it really hurts,
actually, it might
hurt.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just control the numbers and get
everything
sorted.

35:32.263 --> 35:38.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the moment, it's just more
and more tourists
and money in the till, without a
real thought

35:38.536 --> 35:39.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the future.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OLOF YRR ATLADOTTIR: I think
that the growth
has been very rapid.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is very challenging to
meet such a
rapid growth.

35:43.942 --> 35:47.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, yes, we have had growing
pains, yes.

35:47.178 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, Iceland is still full
of spots where
you can still enjoy the
solitude.

35:53.385 --> 35:58.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a few places that
become like other
most popular tourism
destinations, like the

35:59.024 --> 36:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eiffel Tower in Paris or these
hot spots.

36:02.193 --> 36:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tend to become crowded in
Iceland, as
in other places.

36:06.064 --> 36:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Iceland still provides the
possibility
for a very singular experience.

36:10.068 --> 36:14.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GUNNAR THOR JOHANNESSON,
University of Iceland:
My name is Gunnar Thor
Johannesson.

36:14.806 --> 36:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a professor in geography and
tourism at
the University of Iceland,
Reykjavik.

36:20.345 --> 36:26.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My specialty is tourism
development, tourism
policy and planning, and
destination development.

36:26.251 --> 36:30.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to invest, like, in soft
things like
knowledge.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to invest in education
and training.

36:32.957 --> 36:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to invest in -- also in
concrete and
steel.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to invest -- like, in
the road system.

36:39.597 --> 36:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that some of the more
serious challenges
that tourism is facing is that
simply that

36:44.469 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the infrastructure in
some of the
hot spots of tourism is not
strong enough.

36:49.707 --> 36:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN SYKES: The radical kind of
answer would
be to put a ceiling on the
number of people

36:54.479 --> 37:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that come, until we're really
quite happy
that we have the infrastructure
to cope, because,

37:00.652 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the moment, people are coming
on short
three-day holidays, enjoy
Iceland, but are

37:05.590 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going away saying fantastic
country, but it's
expensive, and there are no
toilets, and it's

37:11.496 --> 37:13.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all crowded.

37:13.331 --> 37:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLOF YRR ATLADOTTIR: I actually
don't think
that's very possible, because
that it would

37:17.068 --> 37:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean putting a cap on private
enterprise in
a way, in a very strange sort of
way.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that I would
believe in
that.

37:25.977 --> 37:32.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think that we can both
organize and
plan certain destinations within
Iceland.

37:32.250 --> 37:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, if we look
towards the industry,
which is a very wide industry,
has very, very

37:38.590 --> 37:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many aspects, and I think that
in a way we
can maybe organize the tourism
so it grows,

37:45.497 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as I say, more harmoniously.

37:47.665 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HALLDOR MAR, Resident of
Iceland: My name
is Halldor Mar.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a graphic design student.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm about to get booted out
of my home
because of Airbnb.

37:59.244 --> 38:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The shortage of
hotels and
guest houses in Iceland has led
to an explosion

38:04.883 --> 38:10.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of residents renting out their
homes to tourists
using the Airbnb Web site.

38:10.788 --> 38:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Halldor Mar doesn't believe that
new legislation
tightening the rules on Airbnb
rentals will

38:16.361 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help potential tenants.

38:18.363 --> 38:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He claims that future rent may
account for
70 percent of his earnings,
which tempers

38:23.268 --> 38:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his enthusiasm for the tourist
influx.

38:25.570 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HALLDOR MAR: They're taking away
our homes,
you know?

38:30.275 --> 38:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's good that they're coming.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's not really their fault.

38:33.678 --> 38:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think they're aware of
the problem.

38:38.683 --> 38:45.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the landlords, just
everybody here wants
to make money and get into the
market, tourism

38:45.857 --> 38:46.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

38:46.858 --> 38:47.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the problem.

38:47.926 --> 38:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHILDUR BRAGADOTTI, Director,
Reykjavik:
Hi.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Ashildur Bragadotti.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm the director of Visit
Reykjavik.

38:51.396 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are not facing any problems,
in my opinion.

38:55.567 --> 39:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, we have to be
concerned because
the growth has been so much,
more than anyone

39:01.139 --> 39:03.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could have expected.

39:03.575 --> 39:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are some challenges
that we're facing
because of that.

39:08.012 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes, like, two to three
years to build
a hotel.

39:13.017 --> 39:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, Airbnb has become
more common in
Reykjavik, and that's something
that -- a

39:19.624 --> 39:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question that we're facing now.

39:21.526 --> 39:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are there too many citizens
lending out their
houses?

39:27.232 --> 39:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUNNAR THOR JOHANNESSON: I think
it's also
positive not to ban Airbnb
altogether.

39:33.271 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now we have a limit.

39:35.039 --> 39:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a 90-day period that
you are able
to rent out, or a certain amount
of income

39:39.978 --> 39:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're able to have before
you have to
apply for a license.

39:43.348 --> 39:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this means that actually
normal people
are able actually to take part
in this boom,

39:50.421 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this tourism boom.

39:51.589 --> 39:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HALLDOR MAR: This country is not
for Icelanders
anymore.

39:54.459 --> 39:57.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's more for tourists.

39:57.428 --> 40:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm looking at maybe we just
have to move
abroad.

40:01.132 --> 40:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is going to be a
tourists' country,
rather than Iceland.

40:06.070 --> 40:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's call it tourist land,
rather than Iceland,
from now on, I guess.

40:10.775 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN SYKES: The tourism will drop
off within
the next three years.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The numbers will stabilize.

40:17.048 --> 40:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think they're going to
reach the numbers
they think.

40:20.084 --> 40:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's going to be a
kind of oversupply,
and people are going to kind of
start to go

40:26.891 --> 40:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bankrupt, basically, because
they're going
to be cut-pricing each other.

STEPHEN GILLES, Tourist: My name
is Stephen
Gilles.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm a student at the
Massachusetts Maritime
Academy and also a world
traveler.

40:35.366 --> 40:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What moves me about Iceland is
that there's
such little pollution, unlike a
lot of the

40:40.271 --> 40:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other places that I have been in
the world.

40:42.173 --> 40:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just came from Dubai, and we
went into the
middle of the desert.

40:46.077 --> 40:49.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I was still finding
pollution, plastic,
rubbish.

40:49.347 --> 40:54.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you come here, and you go to
the middle
of nowhere, and you won't find
that.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's unspoiled.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's surreal.

41:00.525 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And in Northern
Iceland,
this whale-watching trip
delivered what it

41:11.369 --> 41:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promised, the majestic and rare
sight of normally
solitary humpbacks feeding in
pairs.

41:18.376 --> 41:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the downside of high
prices and crowds,
the island is unforgettable.

41:23.548 --> 41:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Iceland.

41:32.657 --> 41:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If you are
planning to travel
to Iceland or some other
destination, you

41:46.738 --> 41:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might want to take a tip from
novelist and
poet Russell Banks.

41:50.408 --> 41:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the age of social media,
selfies and even
selfie sticks, he considers the
differences

41:55.146 --> 41:57.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between a traveler and a
tourist.

41:57.448 --> 42:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSSELL BANKS, Novelist: One way
to distinguish
a tourist from a traveler is
that a tourist

42:02.687 --> 42:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carries a camera or a phone and
takes pictures
with one or both.

42:07.425 --> 42:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A traveler carries no camera and
uses his
or her phone mainly to make
occasional phone

42:12.363 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calls home or when lost for the
GPS.

42:15.299 --> 42:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I used to carry a camera when I
traveled,
but almost never took any
pictures with it,

42:21.839 --> 42:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and apologized when I returned
home, until
I realized that my reluctance to
point and

42:27.011 --> 42:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
click was really a reluctance to
line up and
edit and frame whatever I was
seeing or hearing

42:33.484 --> 42:34.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or smelling.

42:35.019 --> 42:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fall of the morning sunlight
against the
glittering sea.

42:38.656 --> 42:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crinkled face of an old
woman selling
spices in the market.

42:42.493 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was, I believe, an
instinctive reluctance
to remove myself from my
experience, an experience

42:47.965 --> 42:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could only occur far from
home and habit,
where the rules as much as the
landscape were

42:54.238 --> 42:56.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfamiliar.

42:56.040 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To photograph it was somehow to
reduce and
domesticate my experience and
ultimately to

43:01.312 --> 43:03.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kill it.

43:03.181 --> 43:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew this, but still felt
somehow apologetic
for not having brought back a
photographic

43:07.218 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record of the death of my
experience.

43:09.454 --> 43:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, some time in the early
1980s, I was
invited by a few magazines and
journals to

43:14.992 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take a trip anywhere you like,
the Seychelles
in the middle of the Indian
Ocean, Alaska,

43:19.297 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Andes, and write about it
and get paid
for it, travel writing.

43:25.636 --> 43:28.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The photography will be taken
care of by a
professional.

43:28.773 --> 43:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could leave my camera at home,
and did.

43:33.144 --> 43:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Instead, I brought a notebook.

43:35.713 --> 43:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every night before sleeping,
I spent a
half-hour and sometimes more
remembering and

43:40.451 --> 43:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recapitulating my day, even when
nothing happened,
when I met no one of interest or
went nowhere

43:46.491 --> 43:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond the veranda outside my
bedroom, and
merely read the local newspaper
and chatted

43:51.829 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
briefly with the housekeeper,
because there
was always something happening
in my head.

43:57.702 --> 44:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we are dislocated, not
relocated, we
think new thoughts, deal with
unbidden strange

44:03.975 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emotions, reflect on our past in
a freshened
way, from a new perspective.

44:08.980 --> 44:14.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We remember and are surprisingly
saddened
by a brief liaison or flirtation
we have not

44:14.519 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thought about in decades.

44:16.354 --> 44:22.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We decide to reread that
1,000-page novel
our smartest friends insist is a
work of genius,

44:22.927 --> 44:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but somehow we didn't get it the
first time
around and gave up 50 pages in.

44:28.065 --> 44:33.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's now more than 30 years that
I have traveled
without a camera and snapped no
pictures with

44:33.337 --> 44:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my iPhone, and I never apologize
for it.

44:36.974 --> 44:43.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, when I travel, every
night in a hotel
room or a cabin or a tent, I sit
down and

44:43.981 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
write, sometimes by candlelight,
an account
of my day, whether I'm writing
for hire or

44:49.287 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just traveling on my own.

44:51.389 --> 44:57.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My notes have the effect of
organizing my
attention for the next day,
making me a sharper

44:57.228 --> 45:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
observer, a more careful
listener, a more
thoughtful guest.

45:02.400 --> 45:07.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't do it to show to anyone
else or so
I can reread my notes months or
years later

45:07.538 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and remember the joys and pains
of that particular
journey.

45:12.176 --> 45:13.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No need.

45:14.011 --> 45:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The simple act of writing it
down in the first
place imprints the journey in my
conscious

45:18.382 --> 45:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
memory, stores it there, like a
buried treasure.

45:22.653 --> 45:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's my private treasure, and
only I possess
the map.
