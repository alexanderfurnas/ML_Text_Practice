JUDY WOODRUFF: From North
Korea today, new defiance.

00:03.533 --> 00:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The communist regime's leader,
Kim Jong-un, insisted that
he will never negotiate away

00:09.400 --> 00:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his missile and
nuclear programs.

00:11.466 --> 00:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the world's highest
diplomatic body held
an emergency session
on how to get the North

00:16.233 --> 00:17.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do just that.

00:17.866 --> 00:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Nick Schifrin
begins our coverage.

00:20.666 --> 00:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This afternoon
in the U.N. Security Council,
the U.S. tried to rally

00:26.800 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world to punish and
isolate North Korea.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations: It is a
dark day, because yesterday's

00:30.533 --> 00:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions by North Korea made the
world a more dangerous place.

00:34.666 --> 00:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: U.S. Ambassador
Nikki Haley said North Korea's
test of an intercontinental

00:38.800 --> 00:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ballistic missile requires
a global response.

00:41.133 --> 00:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NIKKI HALEY: They have
not had any care for
Russia or China in this.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have not listened to
anything that you have said.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to listen
to anything that you say.

00:51.533 --> 00:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's time that we all
stand together and say, we will
not put up with this action.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Haley is trying
to lead a diplomatic effort to
change North Korean behavior.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. needs Chinese and
Russian help, but Beijing and
Moscow have their own strategy.

01:04.966 --> 01:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR SAFRONKOV, Deputy
Russian Ambassador to the United
Nations (through translator):

01:07.333 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We call for all interested
states to act with restraint,
rather than provocation
and war-mongering.

01:11.433 --> 01:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIU JIEYI, Chinese Ambassador
to the United Nations (through
translator): We call on all

01:15.200 --> 01:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the concerned parties
to exercise restraint,
avoid provocative
actions and belligerent

01:19.533 --> 01:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric, and demonstrate the
will for unconditional dialogue.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Tuesday's
missile launch crossed
the intercontinental
threshold the U.S. had

01:28.833 --> 01:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been hoping to prevent.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In science terms, the missile
advance was an incremental,
but U.S. officials tell the

01:33.633 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" it was in a new,
previously unseen configuration.

01:36.900 --> 01:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was fired from a mobile
launcher, had a reentry vehicle,
and was two-stage, as seen

01:42.666 --> 01:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on North Korean TV.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The immediate American
response was its own launch.

01:48.466 --> 01:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. and South
Korean militaries fired
tactical missiles today
that can be rapidly

01:52.033 --> 01:54.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deployed.

01:54.066 --> 01:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And South Korea released a
video of what an attack on North
Korea would look like, blowing

02:00.533 --> 02:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up North Korean missiles, and
video game graphics of a South
Korean jet bombing Pyongyang.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as of now, the focus is
very much on diplomacy and
increasing pressure on North

02:11.733 --> 02:13.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
released a statement hours
after the missile launch,

02:16.066 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying any country that helps
North Korea is aiding and
abetting a dangerous regime,

02:23.066 --> 02:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that all countries that
all countries must show North
Korea there are consequences

02:24.733 --> 02:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to their pursuit
of nuclear weapons.

02:27.366 --> 02:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a tweet this morning,
President Trump expressed
frustration that China
hasn't done more, writing:

02:31.500 --> 02:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"So much for China
working with us.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we had to give it a try."

02:35.366 --> 02:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the administration
is casting a wide net.

02:38.200 --> 02:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump talked with
Egyptian President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi by phone.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea sells missile
technology and receives
remittances from Africa
to Southeast Asia.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try and stop that income,
today, the U.S. delivered a
threat to China and others.

02:52.966 --> 02:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY: There are countries
that are allowing, even
encouraging, trade with North

02:57.533 --> 03:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Korea, in violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions.

03:01.533 --> 03:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Such countries would
also like to continue
their trade arrangements
with the United States.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not going to happen.

03:08.633 --> 03:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The U.S. military
in South Korea says it is being
-- quote -- "self-restrained."

03:12.333 --> 03:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That policy will remain until
the diplomacy plays out.

03:15.933 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Nick Schifrin.

03:18.066 --> 03:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
detailed look at the question
of sanctions and North Korea

03:22.533 --> 03:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.
