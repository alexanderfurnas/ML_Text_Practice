WHAT REID IS EXPECTED TO

BILL THAT SAYS THE GOVERNMEN

02:55.967 --> 02:57.233
WILL NOT FUND OBAMA CARE

02:57.233 --> 02:58.467
WHAT THE SENATE BILL WIL

02:58.467 --> 02:59.867
ACTUALLY HAVE IS FUNDING FOR

02:59.867 --> 03:00.567
OBAMA CARE

>> WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF A

03:08.400 --> 03:11.467
ACTUAL SHUTDOWN HERE

03:11.467 --> 03:14.100
>> I'VE LEARNED TO STO

03:14.100 --> 03:15.233
PROGNOSTICATING WHAT CONGRES

03:15.233 --> 03:16.900
DOES

03:16.900 --> 03:19.300
IF THERE IS ONE THING HAVE I

03:19.300 --> 03:22.367
HAVE LEARNED THAT THE 535 ME

03:22.367 --> 03:25.267
AND WOMEN ARE UNINCREDIBLELY

03:25.267 --> 03:27.067
UNPREDICTABLE AND DEFY

03:27.067 --> 03:28.233
PREDICTIONS FROM PEOPLE MUCH

03:28.233 --> 03:30.367
MUCH WISER THAN I AM

03:30.367 --> 03:33.300
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE A WAY

03:33.300 --> 03:35.433
THAT THERE IS COMPROMISE

03:35.433 --> 03:37.633
BOTH SIDES ARE SO DUG IN AND

03:37.633 --> 03:40.467
YOU'RE IN THIS UNUSUAL SCENARI

03:40.467 --> 03:42.767
WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE --

03:42.767 --> 03:43.667
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ARE

03:43.667 --> 03:49.400
ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT

03:49.400 --> 03:53.533
THE FEES FAEBLT OF PASSING A

03:53.533 --> 03:53.867
BUDGET

03:53.867 --> 03:55.800
TOM COBURN IS SAYING WE DON'

03:55.800 --> 03:57.433
HAVE THE VOTES TO SAY THIS

03:57.433 --> 03:58.633
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE ARE

03:58.633 --> 03:59.833
SAYING, NO, THAT'S NOT GOO

03:59.833 --> 04:00.333
ENOUGH

04:00.333 --> 04:03.000
IT'S HARD TO SEE A WAY FORWARD

04:03.000 --> 04:04.933
WHEN BOTH SIDES ARE SCREAMING AT

04:04.933 --> 04:06.467
EACH OTHER, NO

04:06.467 --> 04:08.367
>> WHERE DOES THIS PUT THE

04:08.367 --> 04:09.467
LEADER OF THE HOUSE, JOH

04:09.467 --> 04:09.967
BOEHNER.

04:09.967 --> 04:12.533
>> HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DECID

04:12.533 --> 04:13.533
WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT ON THE

04:13.533 --> 04:15.367
FLOOR A VERSION OF THE BUDGE

04:15.367 --> 04:17.200
THAT INCLUDES FUNDING FOR OBAM

04:17.200 --> 04:17.333
CARE

04:17.333 --> 04:19.433
THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE WILL SEND

04:19.433 --> 04:19.633
HIM.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.400
BUT A BILL LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY

04:21.400 --> 04:23.867
DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HIS

04:23.867 --> 04:24.333
REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.700
THE SPEAKER HAS PUT HIMSELF IN

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
TRICKY SITUATIONS LIKE THI

04:28.300 --> 04:30.900
BEFORE WHERE HE'S ENRAGED TH

04:30.900 --> 04:33.833
RIGHT BY PUTTING A BILL ON THE

04:33.833 --> 04:35.300
FLOOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE THEI

04:35.300 --> 04:37.100
SUPPORT THAT ULTIMATELY PASSES

04:37.100 --> 04:38.600
BECAUSE IT ENDS UP PASSING WIT

04:38.600 --> 04:39.533
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT

04:39.533 --> 04:41.267
EVERY TIME HE DOES THAT THER

04:41.267 --> 04:43.067
ARE CALLS FOR HIS OUSTER FRO

04:43.067 --> 04:44.667
THE RIGHT.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.400
WHAT JOHN BOEHNER DOES I THINK

04:47.400 --> 04:48.267
WILL DETERMINE HOW THI

04:48.267 --> 04:49.200
SITUATION IS RESOLVED.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.700
>> IS THERE A WAY OUT OF IT?

04:51.700 --> 04:55.267
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMEN

04:55.267 --> 04:58.467
ALWAYS SEEMS TO KEEP RUNNING AND

04:58.467 --> 04:59.700
THERE IS ALWAYS A LIGHT AT THE

04:59.700 --> 05:01.567
END OF THE TUNNEL IN SITUATION

05:01.567 --> 05:03.167
LIKE THESE

05:03.167 --> 05:04.933
I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS IT'S A

05:04.933 --> 05:06.833
VERY BUMPY RIDE BUT TH

05:06.833 --> 05:07.933
GOVERNMENT WILL BE FUNDED.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.400
HOW THAT LOOKS AT THE END OF

05:09.400 --> 05:11.433
THIS WEEK, TWO WEEK FIGHT WE

05:11.433 --> 05:13.400
HAVE AHEAD OF US, WHO KNOWS.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.400
>> A QUESTION I HAVE, AS YOU

05:15.400 --> 05:17.433
TALK TO ALL THESE DIFFEREN

05:17.433 --> 05:19.767
MEMBERS, IS THERE A SENSE OF

05:19.767 --> 05:23.133
CONTROVERSY FATIGUE OR DO THEY

05:23.133 --> 05:24.367
RELISH THIS BRINKSMANSHIP?

05:24.367 --> 05:26.167
>> ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING

05:26.167 --> 05:28.833
THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS

05:28.833 --> 05:31.767
THAT THE TEA PARTY ITSELF HA

05:31.767 --> 05:33.033
STARTED TO SPLIT

05:33.033 --> 05:35.000
THIS IS A GROUP OF LEGISLATURE

05:35.000 --> 05:39.800
WHO WERE ELECTED TO CONGRESS I

05:39.800 --> 05:41.367
2010 BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE NO

05:41.367 --> 05:44.033
GOING TO COMPROMISE ON ANYTHIN

05:44.033 --> 05:50.967
AND THAT HELPED EXACERBATE THI

05:50.967 --> 05:51.333
GOVERNING BY CRISES DEADLINE

05:51.333 --> 05:52.800
THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING

05:52.800 --> 05:54.133

06:06.833 --> 06:09.800
CARE REPUBLICANS DO NOT CONTRO

06:09.800 --> 06:12.100
CONGRESS AND IF THEY DID THE

06:12.100 --> 06:13.567
WOULD HAVE TO OVERRIDE A

06:13.567 --> 06:14.600
PRESIDENT'S VETO AND THAT'S NO

06:14.600 --> 06:15.267
GOING TO HAPPEN.

06:15.267 --> 06:15.933

18:48.233 --> 18:50.833
WE'RE JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR FOR

18:50.833 --> 18:52.867
U.S. CHINA RELATIONS

18:52.867 --> 18:54.667
FIRST QUESTION, WHY WAS THIS

18:54.667 --> 18:57.067
TRIAL SO SIGNIFICANT IN CHINA?

18:57.067 --> 19:00.133
>> WELL, IT WAS NOT ONLY A

19:00.133 --> 19:01.300
ISOLATED CASE OF ONE OFFICIA

19:01.300 --> 19:08.233
WHO WAS CORRUPT BUT A HIGH

19:08.233 --> 19:08.533
OFFICIAL

19:08.533 --> 19:11.033
SO THIS SORT OF REACHED BACK

19:11.033 --> 19:12.933
INTO THE DEEP RECESSES BEHIN

19:12.933 --> 19:17.500
THE VEIL OF HIGH PARTY POLITICS.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.100
THIS WAS A THREAT TO OTHER

19:19.100 --> 19:20.667
LEADERS BECAUSE HE SAW THE POWER

19:20.667 --> 19:24.133
BASE THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE

19:24.133 --> 19:27.033
CONSENSUAL KIND OF BACK ROOM

19:27.033 --> 19:28.700
LEADERSHIP AGREEMENTS THAT

19:28.700 --> 19:30.867
USUALLY DECIDE WHO RISES

19:30.867 --> 19:32.600
HE SOUGHT TO RALLY A POPULAR

19:32.600 --> 19:33.367
FOLLOWING.

19:33.367 --> 19:37.033
>> THIS WAS VERY THREATENING T

19:37.033 --> 19:39.300
OTHERS IN THE TOP LEADERSHIP

19:39.300 --> 19:41.700
WAS THIS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO

19:41.700 --> 19:43.467
CHINA OVERALL WHEN IT COMES TO

19:43.467 --> 19:45.600
THE PRIVATE LIVES OF SOME OF OUR

19:45.600 --> 19:47.800
MOST POWERFUL POLITICIANS?

19:47.800 --> 19:50.533
>> YES, IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.433
NOT ONLY IS HE A HIGH POLITICIAN

19:52.433 --> 19:59.667
WITH A HIGH VISIBILITY SIGN AT

19:59.667 --> 20:02.567
OXFORD BUT HIS FATHER WAS A HIGH

20:02.567 --> 20:04.467
VISIBILITY POLITICIAN AND HE

20:04.467 --> 20:06.567
TOO, SPENT 11 YEARS IN PRISON,

20:06.567 --> 20:08.700
WAS REHABILITATED AND IT LOOKS

20:08.700 --> 20:10.667
LIKE HE WILL GO TO THE SAM

20:10.667 --> 20:12.767
PRISON THAT HIS FATHER WENT TO

20:12.767 --> 20:14.700
WHICH IS SORT OF PARADOX

20:14.700 --> 20:16.800
>> CAN WE EXPECT THIS LIFE

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
SENTENCE TO BE CARRIED OUT O

20:18.800 --> 20:21.233
PERHAPS HE'LL BE PARDONED A FE

20:21.233 --> 20:22.800
YEARS FROM NOW IN ANOTHE

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
CHAPTER OF HIS RECOVERY?

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
>> IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY I

20:26.400 --> 20:26.667
CHINA.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.767
IF THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE

20:28.767 --> 20:31.733
POLITICALLY SPEAKING WITH HI

20:31.733 --> 20:33.733
CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IN

20:33.733 --> 20:34.867
CONTROL, I THINK HE'S NOT GOIN

20:34.867 --> 20:36.467
TO HAVE MUCH OF

20:36.467 --> 20:36.633
REHABILITATION

20:36.633 --> 20:40.133
BUT THE LORD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS

20:40.133 --> 20:42.167
WAYS AND CHINA HAS FREQUENTL

20:42.167 --> 20:45.767
UNDERGONE MAJOR TECH TONIC

20:45.767 --> 20:46.033
CHANGES.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.300
IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW

20:47.300 --> 20:51.133

WHO HAS A SUBSTANTIAL FOLLOWIN

20:53.933 --> 20:56.133
DESPITE HIS INDISCRETIONS.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.167

20:58.167 --> 21:01.300
ATTENTION TO THIS?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
>> I THINK THE U.S. KNOWS A LO

21:03.300 --> 21:05.333
ABOUT THIS CASE BECAUSE HI

21:16.000 --> 21:16.933

21:16.933 --> 21:19.900
I THINK THE U.S. HAS DON

21:19.900 --> 21:20.800
VERY

21:20.800 --> 21:24.967
LITTLE ABOUT IT.

21:24.967 --> 21:25.967
THEY KNOW A LOT.

21:25.967 --> 21:28.133
THEY HAVE PAID A LOT O

21:28.133 --> 21:29.867
ATTENTION BUT CHOSEN JUST TO B

21:29.867 --> 21:30.433
SILENT

IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THES
