JUDY WOODRUFF: And Senator
Roger Wicker of Mississippi was
also at the White House today.

00:04.866 --> 00:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started by asking him if the
president's engagement adds
more pressure on Republicans.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:12.433 --> 00:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER (R), Mississippi:
Well, I guess there is some
pressure on some of the people

00:15.600 --> 00:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are sort of still
doubtful about this.

00:19.266 --> 00:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't feel the pressure,
because I have been a yes
vote for quite some time.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me tell you,
there are two schools of
thought on moving forward.

00:29.166 --> 00:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The majority leader, Senator
McConnell, would like to get to
a vote on the motion to proceed

00:35.333 --> 00:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and see where people are.

00:36.866 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, if we win, great,
we proceed to the bill.

00:39.333 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not, at least people have
voted, and we know what the
target is, if we lose by two

00:44.966 --> 00:47.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or three votes.

00:47.033 --> 00:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president, on the other
hand, really thinks that, over
the next few days, we can get 50

00:52.466 --> 00:54.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
votes to yes.

00:54.666 --> 00:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was all about today
getting into the details of
what's keeping various members

01:02.300 --> 01:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from being able to say 100
percent that they can support
this legislation and deciding

01:09.766 --> 01:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what levers to pull to
get the bill to a place
where 50 of us can say yes.

01:16.666 --> 01:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the reason
I'm asking about pressure is
because, a couple of weeks

01:19.233 --> 01:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, when Senator Dean Heller of
Nevada indicated he was having
problems with the legislation,

01:26.200 --> 01:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was a political action
group supporting the president
that ran ads against him.

01:31.100 --> 01:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that the kind of...

01:31.800 --> 01:32.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:32.800 --> 01:34.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:34.933 --> 01:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: And I think that
was generally considered to be
bad form and counterproductive

01:38.366 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
among people in the
Republican Conference.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let
me ask you a little bit
about the substance of this.

01:44.400 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, a lot of discussion
about what this bill would
mean for coverage, including

01:50.033 --> 01:52.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

01:52.066 --> 01:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vice president of your home
state -- a Mississippi state
hospital association quoted

01:56.133 --> 02:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this week as saying they
are opposed to anything
that increases the
number of uninsured in

02:01.766 --> 02:02.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mississippi.

02:02.766 --> 02:04.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:04.866 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGER WICKER: Well, for
one thing, I don't think
it would increase the
number of uninsured.

02:10.666 --> 02:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These changes are based on
projections of people that will
be covered, if the estimates

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are correct.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I would just challenge that.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me also say -- and I
don't mean to be critical, or
I don't mean this to be taken

02:27.933 --> 02:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong -- but there's never
been a provider who came to us
and said, we need you to slow

02:36.333 --> 02:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the growth rate of these
entitlement programs.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, that's just
not something that
they're going to say.

02:42.266 --> 02:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the fact is we can
make health care better
for Mississippians, and
we can make coverage

02:49.533 --> 02:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better for the average American,
while, at the same time,
saving a system that is not

02:55.933 --> 02:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sustainable for
future generations.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we can do that.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at the end of the day,
I think people in the health
care business, in the hospital

03:07.133 --> 03:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business in future years
will say, you have saved
the system and good for you.

03:13.366 --> 03:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when
I read that there are
almost half-a-million
children in Mississippi

03:17.366 --> 03:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who depend on Medicaid, are
you saying they don't have
anything to worry about?

03:21.366 --> 03:23.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: I think -- well,
for one thing, we are not
a Medicaid expansion state.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: Our state
didn't choose to do that.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it's completely
inaccurate to say that
these 500,000 children
are going to lose their

03:35.400 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

03:36.066 --> 03:38.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're not.

03:38.133 --> 03:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a matter of fact, there will
be a tradition - - I mean, there
will be a transition -- I'm

03:41.800 --> 03:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sorry -- and states that
expanded Medicaid will have a
seven-year period and there will

03:51.400 --> 03:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be an extra incentive for those
states who chose not to do that.

03:56.200 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those 500,000 children that
you talk about are not going to
have their coverage threatened.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Roger Wicker joining us
from the Capitol, we thank you.

04:08.433 --> 04:09.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROGER WICKER: Thank you.

04:11.466 --> 04:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a quick
postscript: We don't know yet
what the latest revisions to

04:13.500 --> 04:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate bill to repeal and
replace the Affordable Care
Act will include, but, for

04:17.633 --> 04:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the record, the Congressional
Budget Office already estimated
what would happen with the

04:22.300 --> 04:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first version of the bill.

04:24.300 --> 04:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It concluded there would be 15
million fewer Medicaid enrollees
in a decade than projected

04:30.266 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under current law.

04:32.300 --> 04:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also said that, over the
long haul, states would likely
have to either spend more money,

04:36.566 --> 04:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cut payments, eliminate
services or limit who's
eligible for Medicaid.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not clear how many
children would be affected.
