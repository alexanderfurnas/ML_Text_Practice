JUDY WOODRUFF: The tensions
between Saudi
Arabia and Iran continued to
echo throughout

00:05.005 --> 00:10.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Persian Gulf today, as
Kuwait became the
latest Sunni nation to pull its
ambassador

00:10.744 --> 00:15.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Tehran, though it didn't
fully cut off
diplomatic ties.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But how is this crisis seen from
Iran?

00:18.385 --> 00:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to William Brangham for
that.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
the story, I'm
now joined on the phone by
Thomas Erdbrink,

00:23.657 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is the New York Times bureau
chief in
Tehran.

00:26.360 --> 00:32.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Thomas, Saudi Arabia
executes this Shiite
cleric, Nimr al-Nimr. Protests
in Iran against

00:32.199 --> 00:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saudis get out of hand, and
the Saudi
Embassy in Iran is destroyed.
You reported

00:36.536 --> 00:40.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this morning that the government
likely instigated
those initial protests, but did
they want

00:40.707 --> 00:42.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to get as far out of hand as
it did?

00:42.843 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK, The New York
Times: Just
today, one of the heads of the
Iranian Revolutionary

00:47.848 --> 00:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guard Corps told to the Fars
News Agency that
what happened at the embassy was
completely

00:55.088 --> 01:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unjustifiable, it should have
never have happened,
and he was sure that his troops
were not involved.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have been hearing similar
comments
from other people in the Iranian
establishment,

01:05.866 --> 01:12.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is clearly a sign that
either they feel
the protests have gone too far
or, of course,

01:12.139 --> 01:17.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have been shocked by the
level of blowback
from Saudi Arabia, and are now
trying to do

01:17.210 --> 01:19.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some damage control.

01:19.146 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The focus completely shifted
toward them because
of their own actions. And this
is what actually

01:25.385 --> 01:30.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian officials are
telling me off the
record: Look, we don't like to
admit it, but

01:30.223 --> 01:32.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we shoved ourselves to the front
by doing
this.

01:32.659 --> 01:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You report
that this crisis
comes at a time when Iran was
really hoping

01:36.163 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to emerge as a growing power in
the Middle
East. They just signed a nuclear
deal. Sanctions

01:40.434 --> 01:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were soon to be eased. President
Rouhani was
hoping to be celebrating, not be
dealing with

01:44.271 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what does this mean for him
and for other
reformers in Iran?

01:48.075 --> 01:52.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well, of
course, Mr. Rouhani
came to power with the promise
of mending

01:52.813 --> 01:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relations with other countries.

01:54.915 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The historic nuclear deal was a
clear example
of his administration going out,
negotiating

02:00.921 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for two -- for two full years,
and then getting
Iran a deal that its supreme
leader, Ayatollah

02:06.493 --> 02:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khamenei, could sign off on. So,
that, by
itself, was a major boost for
President Rouhani.

02:11.732 --> 02:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, now, in a time
that he was
hoping to see the result of
those negotiations,

02:18.472 --> 02:26.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sanctions are about to be
lifted in the
coming days or weeks, he is
faced with the

02:26.179 --> 02:29.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remains of the Saudi Arabian
Embassy.

02:29.182 --> 02:36.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And several countries, Bahrain,
the United
Arab Emirates and two other
nations have either

02:36.890 --> 02:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely disconnected their
diplomatic relations
with Iran or have at least
seriously downgraded

02:42.696 --> 02:44.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

02:44.531 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for President Rouhani, this
is a setback.
At the same time, he is trying
literally to

02:51.304 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come out with a more positive
spin on this.
He's been condemning, like many
other officials,

02:57.611 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happened at the embassy.
And, of course,
the Iranians are hoping that, in
the long

03:01.615 --> 03:06.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run, it will be, in the end,
Saudi Arabia
that will come out as the bad
guy, if you

03:06.653 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will, out of this.

03:08.455 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's look a
little bit
more broadly in the region. Does
this jeopardize

03:11.358 --> 03:15.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the larger diplomatic
initiatives that Iran
was involved in, the talks about
ending the

03:15.362 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Syrian civil war and the
fighting in Yemen?
What does this crisis do to
those efforts?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well, it's
absolutely a major
obstacle.

03:21.968 --> 03:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's face it. Iran is a
player in those
two theaters that you mentioned.
It allegedly

03:29.342 --> 03:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supports the Houthi rebels in
Yemen. And,
of course, it supports President
Bashar al-Assad

03:35.882 --> 03:37.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

03:37.684 --> 03:44.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iran has just, through
negotiations, gotten
so far that it was invited in
these major

03:44.091 --> 03:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talks that we're seeing every
couple months
on Saudi Arabia. The next one is
about the

03:49.196 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take place on January 25. But
now the whole
debate has shifted towards the
relationship

03:54.734 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between Iran and Saudi Arabia,
instead of
solving the crisis inside Syria.

04:00.173 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if that meeting will still
happen on the
25th, will the -- will Saudi
Arabia allow

04:06.113 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it? Will Iran go along as it is
now? Because
we don't know how this will spin
out of control.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So all and all, this is a major
obstacle to
peace in Syria and Yemen.

04:15.989 --> 04:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Again, does
this indicate
that the Saudis intentionally
killed Nimr

04:20.060 --> 04:24.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now to incite this very reaction
and set back
the talks because they didn't
like the way

04:24.164 --> 04:24.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were heading?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well,
absolutely.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what the Iranians will
also tell you.
They feel as if a trap was laid
out for them,

04:30.871 --> 04:34.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they sort of stepped in it
with their
eyes closed.

04:34.541 --> 04:40.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The view of the Iranians is that
Saudi Arabia
has always been their regional
competitor.

04:40.847 --> 04:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whenever there is a conflict
involving
a Shia minority, or, for
instance, the execution

04:46.686 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this Shia ayatollah in Saudi
Arabia, the
Iranians feel as if the Saudis
are actually

04:53.226 --> 04:54.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trying to hurt them.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thomas
Erdbrink of The New
York Times, thank you very much.

04:57.164 --> 04:57.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Thank you.
