HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: With marijuana
legal in some form in 26
states and the District

00:05.000 --> 00:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Columbia, many of our kids
have questions about pot.

RAND Corporation behavioral
scientist Elizabeth
D'Amico offers her
humble opinion on how to

00:14.533 --> 00:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answer their queries.

00:16.566 --> 00:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH D'AMICO,
RAND Corporation: Among
family and friends, I'm
regarded as the Dear

00:20.366 --> 00:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Abby of adolescent
so-called bad behavior.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the reason why.

00:26.133 --> 00:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I have researched
alcohol and drug use among teens
for more than 20 years, and

00:30.200 --> 00:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm a parent, people
always assume I have
devised a foolproof
strategy for talking to

00:34.800 --> 00:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids about such issues.

00:36.833 --> 00:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lately, I have been fielding
a lot of questions about
marijuana legalization.

00:43.066 --> 00:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do feel like I have an
edge when it comes to talking
to my kids about marijuana.

00:46.333 --> 00:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, sometimes, it seems like
I am sharing information on
the fly, as I drive my kids

00:51.133 --> 00:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down a busy L.A.
street to school.

00:53.300 --> 00:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since recreational marijuana
was legalized in California
last fall, a new billboards

00:57.766 --> 01:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pop up all the time to advertise
the fine art of smoking
weed and where to buy it.

01:04.766 --> 01:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This leads my kids, 11 and
13, to ask a lot of questions:
Why do people smoke marijuana?

01:10.100 --> 01:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It can't be bad if
it's legal and they can
advertise, right, mom?

01:14.233 --> 01:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As always, it is best
to give balanced, honest
answers based on facts.

01:18.933 --> 01:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do people smoke marijuana?

01:21.466 --> 01:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some may smoke it for medical
reasons, to help with pain.

01:24.433 --> 01:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Others may smoke
it recreationally.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Parents might liken
it to alcohol.

01:28.966 --> 01:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know how some people
have a glass of wine
with dinner to relax?

01:32.100 --> 01:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now some may smoke pot
for the same reason.

01:35.133 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also important that
your kids know that getting can
change their mood and behavior.

01:42.066 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just like alcohol, tell
your kids it's illegal to drive
after you have smoked pot.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell my kids the main reason
that marijuana is illegal for
those under 21 is because their

01:51.066 --> 01:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains are still developing,
and marijuana can affect their
concentration and memory.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It may mean you don't
do as well in school.

01:58.366 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That can mean fewer
opportunities, like
getting a good job.

02:01.433 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given this changing legal
landscape, my kids and yours are
going to be exposed to marijuana

02:06.400 --> 02:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as frequently as
they are to alcohol.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now that it's legal, here
come the marketing campaigns,
which all make smoking pot seem

02:14.533 --> 02:16.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

02:16.600 --> 02:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just like alcohol and
tobacco ads, marijuana ads
may influence their choices.

02:21.533 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My own research has shown that
middle school kids who reported
seeing ads for medical marijuana

02:27.966 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were more likely to report
smoking pot one year later.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't just say, don't do it.

02:33.300 --> 02:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you can get the facts, share
them with your kids, and help
them make a healthy choice.
