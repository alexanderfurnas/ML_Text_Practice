BACK AROUND 2006 THEY SET IT AT

TO BE.
BACK AROUND 2006 THEY SET IT AT
6.8% WHICH SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY

27:10.642 --> 27:11.773
BACK AROUND 2006 THEY SET IT AT
6.8% WHICH SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
GOOD NUMBER AT THE TIME BECAUSE

6.8% WHICH SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
GOOD NUMBER AT THE TIME BECAUSE
INTEREST RATES WERE HIGHER THEN.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.739
GOOD NUMBER AT THE TIME BECAUSE
INTEREST RATES WERE HIGHER THEN.
OVER TIME INTEREST RATES HAVE

27:14.741 --> 27:16.171
INTEREST RATES WERE HIGHER THEN.
OVER TIME INTEREST RATES HAVE
GONE DOWN.

27:16.172 --> 27:17.171
OVER TIME INTEREST RATES HAVE

THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION

27:17.173 --> 27:19.170

THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION
GIVEN TO THE CAUSE OF STUDENT
DEBT.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.334
GIVEN TO THE CAUSE OF STUDENT
DEBT.
SO CONGRESS DECIDED TO

27:21.336 --> 27:23.500
DEBT.
SO CONGRESS DECIDED TO
TEMPORARILY CUT IT IN HALF.

27:23.502 --> 27:24.599
SO CONGRESS DECIDED TO
TEMPORARILY CUT IT IN HALF.
THAT COST MONEY.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.598
TEMPORARILY CUT IT IN HALF.
THAT COST MONEY.
ABOUT $6 BILLION A YEAR.

THAT COST MONEY.
ABOUT $6 BILLION A YEAR.
TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.

27:28.299 --> 27:29.830
ABOUT $6 BILLION A YEAR.
TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.
SO THEY GAVE IT AN EXPIRATION

27:29.832 --> 27:30.164
TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.
SO THEY GAVE IT AN EXPIRATION
DATE.

27:30.166 --> 27:31.430
SO THEY GAVE IT AN EXPIRATION
DATE.
THE EXPIRATION DATE ORIGINALLY

27:31.432 --> 27:33.028
DATE.
THE EXPIRATION DATE ORIGINALLY
WAS A YEAR AGO.

27:33.030 --> 27:34.494
THE EXPIRATION DATE ORIGINALLY
WAS A YEAR AGO.
THEY EXTEND IT FOR ONE YEAR.

27:34.496 --> 27:36.126
WAS A YEAR AGO.
THEY EXTEND IT FOR ONE YEAR.
NOW IT'S GOING BACK TO THE

27:36.128 --> 27:37.360
THEY EXTEND IT FOR ONE YEAR.
NOW IT'S GOING BACK TO THE

IT'S REALLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE AGE BREAKDOWN OF THE

OTHERS, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT,
HAVE PROPOSED TYING INTEREST

29:12.975 --> 29:15.139
OTHERS, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT,
HAVE PROPOSED TYING INTEREST
RATES TO MARKET RATES.

29:15.141 --> 29:17.071
HAVE PROPOSED TYING INTEREST
RATES TO MARKET RATES.
SO THE PRESIDENT PROPOSED THAT

29:17.072 --> 29:18.204
RATES TO MARKET RATES.
SO THE PRESIDENT PROPOSED THAT
YOUR RATE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY

29:18.205 --> 29:19.802
SO THE PRESIDENT PROPOSED THAT
YOUR RATE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY
THE TEN-YEAR FEDERAL BORROWING

29:19.804 --> 29:23.767
YOUR RATE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY
THE TEN-YEAR FEDERAL BORROWING
RATE WHICH IS ABOUT .8% RIGHT

29:23.769 --> 29:25.966
THE TEN-YEAR FEDERAL BORROWING
RATE WHICH IS ABOUT .8% RIGHT
NOW PLUS ANOTHER, ACTUALLY IT'S

29:25.968 --> 29:28.531
RATE WHICH IS ABOUT .8% RIGHT
NOW PLUS ANOTHER, ACTUALLY IT'S
ABOUT 1.8% PLUS SOME MORE TO

29:28.533 --> 29:29.931
NOW PLUS ANOTHER, ACTUALLY IT'S
ABOUT 1.8% PLUS SOME MORE TO
COVER THE FEDERAL COST OF

ABOUT 1.8% PLUS SOME MORE TO
COVER THE FEDERAL COST OF
BORROWING.

29:30.332 --> 29:31.262
COVER THE FEDERAL COST OF
BORROWING.
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BRING THE

29:31.265 --> 29:33.728
BORROWING.
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BRING THE
RATE DOWN TO 2.7% BECAUSE THE

29:33.731 --> 29:34.694
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BRING THE
RATE DOWN TO 2.7% BECAUSE THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST

29:34.696 --> 29:36.060
RATE DOWN TO 2.7% BECAUSE THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST
RATES ARE VERY LOW RIGHT NOW.

29:36.061 --> 29:37.193
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST
RATES ARE VERY LOW RIGHT NOW.
YOUR RATE WOULDN'T VARY.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.326
RATES ARE VERY LOW RIGHT NOW.
YOUR RATE WOULDN'T VARY.
WHATEVER THE RATE IS WHEN YOU

29:38.327 --> 29:39.559
YOUR RATE WOULDN'T VARY.
WHATEVER THE RATE IS WHEN YOU
BORROWED THE MONEY WOULD BE THE

29:39.561 --> 29:40.925
WHATEVER THE RATE IS WHEN YOU
BORROWED THE MONEY WOULD BE THE
RATE FOR THE LIFE OF THE LOAN

29:40.927 --> 29:42.522
BORROWED THE MONEY WOULD BE THE
RATE FOR THE LIFE OF THE LOAN
BUT IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO

29:42.525 --> 29:44.823
RATE FOR THE LIFE OF THE LOAN
BUT IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO
RISE OVER TIME, THEN THE

29:44.825 --> 29:46.655
BUT IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO
RISE OVER TIME, THEN THE
STATUTORY RATE WOULD RISE ALONG

29:46.657 --> 29:47.321
RISE OVER TIME, THEN THE
STATUTORY RATE WOULD RISE ALONG
WITH THEM.

29:47.322 --> 29:48.053
STATUTORY RATE WOULD RISE ALONG
WITH THEM.
>> Ifill: ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT

29:48.056 --> 29:49.120
WITH THEM.

LETTING THEM RISE BUT THEN

29:49.122 --> 29:50.020

LETTING THEM RISE BUT THEN
CAPPING THEM?

29:50.021 --> 29:51.018
LETTING THEM RISE BUT THEN

29:56.385 --> 29:57.415
HAVE A CAP ON INTEREST RATES IN

INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY LOW

THE FUTURE.
INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY LOW
RIGHT NOW.

29:58.717 --> 30:00.181
INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY LOW
RIGHT NOW.
BORROWERS WOULD BE TAKING OUT

30:00.183 --> 30:01.313
RIGHT NOW.
BORROWERS WOULD BE TAKING OUT
LOANS THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR

30:01.315 --> 30:02.446
BORROWERS WOULD BE TAKING OUT
LOANS THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR
WOULD GET A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.

30:02.448 --> 30:04.511
LOANS THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR
WOULD GET A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.
IF WE LOOK INTO THE FIVE OR TEN

30:04.513 --> 30:05.777
WOULD GET A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.
IF WE LOOK INTO THE FIVE OR TEN
YEARS FROM NOW INTEREST RATES

30:05.779 --> 30:07.476
IF WE LOOK INTO THE FIVE OR TEN
YEARS FROM NOW INTEREST RATES
ARE PROJECTED TO GO UP.

30:07.478 --> 30:08.976
YEARS FROM NOW INTEREST RATES
