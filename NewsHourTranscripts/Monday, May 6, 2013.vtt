IN THE REGION.
I DON'T THINK THAT ISRAEL WANTS
THAT TO HAPPEN.

09:50.645 --> 09:52.144
I DON'T THINK THAT ISRAEL WANTS
THAT TO HAPPEN.
I DO THINK THEY WERE TAKING WHAT

09:52.146 --> 09:53.343
THAT TO HAPPEN.
I DO THINK THEY WERE TAKING WHAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY.

09:53.345 --> 09:56.743
I DO THINK THEY WERE TAKING WHAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY.
THEY HAD OBVIOUSLY HAD THROUGH

THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF
THESE MISSILES BEFORE THEY GET
INTO LEBANON.

THEY DO SEEM TO BE CALCULATING.
WE SAW PRESS LEAKS THAT THEY

WERE CALCULATING THAT BOTH THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND HEZBOLLAH

WERE CALCULATING THAT BOTH THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND HEZBOLLAH
ARE TOO HEAVILY OCCUPIED TO

SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND HEZBOLLAH
ARE TOO HEAVILY OCCUPIED TO

ARE TOO HEAVILY OCCUPIED TO
REALLY FOCUS ON RETALIATING
AGAINST ISRAEL AND THAT IRAN

10:16.006 --> 10:17.471
REALLY FOCUS ON RETALIATING
AGAINST ISRAEL AND THAT IRAN
ALSO PROBABLY DOES NOT WANT TO

10:17.473 --> 10:19.437
AGAINST ISRAEL AND THAT IRAN
ALSO PROBABLY DOES NOT WANT TO
TAKE ON ISRAEL AT THIS POINT.

11:49.318 --> 11:52.382
ENGAGEMENT WITH HEAVY COSTS TO
THE UNITED STATES.
IN MY SENSE WHAT BARACK OBAMA

11:52.383 --> 11:55.547
THE UNITED STATES.
IN MY SENSE WHAT BARACK OBAMA
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND IS NOT

11:55.550 --> 11:57.414
IN MY SENSE WHAT BARACK OBAMA
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND IS NOT
GETTING AS AN OPTION IS A WAY TO

11:57.416 --> 11:59.314
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND IS NOT
GETTING AS AN OPTION IS A WAY TO
HAVE A SMALL FOOTPRINT

GETTING AS AN OPTION IS A WAY TO
HAVE A SMALL FOOTPRINT
INTERVENTION THAT CHANGED THIS.

12:00.316 --> 12:01.313
HAVE A SMALL FOOTPRINT
INTERVENTION THAT CHANGED THIS.
SO I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING

12:01.314 --> 12:03.380
INTERVENTION THAT CHANGED THIS.
SO I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING
THING IS TO WATCH THE CAUTION

12:03.382 --> 12:05.813
SO I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING
THING IS TO WATCH THE CAUTION
WITH WHICH ISRAEL HAS BEEN

12:05.814 --> 12:07.778
THING IS TO WATCH THE CAUTION
WITH WHICH ISRAEL HAS BEEN
BEHAVING, THE SURGICAL WAY IN

12:07.780 --> 12:09.378
WITH WHICH ISRAEL HAS BEEN
BEHAVING, THE SURGICAL WAY IN
WHICH IT TOOK OUT THESE WEAPONS.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.745
BEHAVING, THE SURGICAL WAY IN
WHICH IT TOOK OUT THESE WEAPONS.
I IMAGINE THAT'S EXACTLY THE

12:10.747 --> 12:11.645
WHICH IT TOOK OUT THESE WEAPONS.
I IMAGINE THAT'S EXACTLY THE
SAME KIND OF THING THAT THE

12:11.647 --> 12:12.744
I IMAGINE THAT'S EXACTLY THE
SAME KIND OF THING THAT THE
UNITED STATES WOULD LIKE TO DO

12:12.746 --> 12:13.977
SAME KIND OF THING THAT THE
UNITED STATES WOULD LIKE TO DO
WITH SECURING THE CHEMICAL

12:13.979 --> 12:15.711
UNITED STATES WOULD LIKE TO DO
WITH SECURING THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

12:15.713 --> 12:17.775
WITH SECURING THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND NOT TURNING THIS INTO AN

12:17.778 --> 12:19.509
WEAPONS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND NOT TURNING THIS INTO AN
EFFORT AGAINST THE BROADER ASSAD

12:19.511 --> 12:21.476
AND NOT TURNING THIS INTO AN
EFFORT AGAINST THE BROADER ASSAD
REGIME AND MAKING THE U.S. AS A

12:21.478 --> 12:22.875
EFFORT AGAINST THE BROADER ASSAD
REGIME AND MAKING THE U.S. AS A
PRINCIPAL PLAYER INSIDE SYRIA'S

12:22.877 --> 12:23.608
REGIME AND MAKING THE U.S. AS A
PRINCIPAL PLAYER INSIDE SYRIA'S
CIVIL WAR.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.108
PRINCIPAL PLAYER INSIDE SYRIA'S
CIVIL WAR.
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING

12:25.110 --> 12:26.341
CIVIL WAR.
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT McCAIN AND OTHERS IS

12:26.342 --> 12:27.840
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT McCAIN AND OTHERS IS
THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE THESE

12:27.843 --> 12:28.840
ABOUT McCAIN AND OTHERS IS
THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE THESE
INITIATIVES AROUND CHEMICAL

12:28.842 --> 12:30.207
THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE THESE
INITIATIVES AROUND CHEMICAL
WEAPONS LEAD TO A BROADER

12:30.209 --> 12:32.305
INITIATIVES AROUND CHEMICAL
WEAPONS LEAD TO A BROADER
OCCASION TO TOPPLE ASSAD.

12:32.308 --> 12:34.504
WEAPONS LEAD TO A BROADER
OCCASION TO TOPPLE ASSAD.
I THINK THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS

12:34.507 --> 12:35.772
OCCASION TO TOPPLE ASSAD.
I THINK THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
POSITIONING ITSELF, IF IT DOES

12:35.774 --> 12:38.305
I THINK THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
POSITIONING ITSELF, IF IT DOES
TAKE ACTION, TO BE ONLY AS

12:38.307 --> 12:39.805
POSITIONING ITSELF, IF IT DOES
TAKE ACTION, TO BE ONLY AS
NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE CHEMICAL

12:39.807 --> 12:41.171
TAKE ACTION, TO BE ONLY AS
NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND NOT REALLY TO BECOME

12:41.173 --> 12:45.837
NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND NOT REALLY TO BECOME
MORE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO

QUESTION, MICHELLE DUNN, IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.369

POSSIBLE?
CAN THE U.S. STAY THAT FOCUSED
ON THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS?

12:52.904 --> 12:54.034
CAN THE U.S. STAY THAT FOCUSED
ON THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS?
AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE

12:54.036 --> 12:56.034
ON THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS?
AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN

THAT'S POSSIBLE.
>> Brown: YOU DON'T?

13:00.868 --> 13:01.933
THAT'S POSSIBLE.
>> Brown: YOU DON'T?
NO, BECAUSE FROM WHAT I

13:01.935 --> 13:03.499
>> Brown: YOU DON'T?
NO, BECAUSE FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND TO ACTUALLY SECURE

NO, BECAUSE FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND TO ACTUALLY SECURE
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THE

13:04.866 --> 13:06.899
UNDERSTAND TO ACTUALLY SECURE
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THE
GROUND IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD

13:06.901 --> 13:09.564

TAKE MORE THAN 10,000 TROOPS AND

IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE
DONE REMOTELY.

13:11.566 --> 13:13.530
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE
DONE REMOTELY.
NOW WHAT THE UNITED STATES COULD

13:13.532 --> 13:15.763
DONE REMOTELY.
NOW WHAT THE UNITED STATES COULD
DO REMOTELY, YOU'VE HEARD

13:15.765 --> 13:17.463
NOW WHAT THE UNITED STATES COULD
DO REMOTELY, YOU'VE HEARD
SENATOR McCAIN SPEAK OF CRUISE

SENATOR McCAIN SPEAK OF CRUISE
MISSILES AND SO FORTH, IS

13:18.698 --> 13:20.294
SENATOR McCAIN SPEAK OF CRUISE
MISSILES AND SO FORTH, IS
PERHAPS GROUND THE SYRIAN AIR

13:20.297 --> 13:21.661
MISSILES AND SO FORTH, IS
PERHAPS GROUND THE SYRIAN AIR
FORCE SO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

13:21.663 --> 13:23.761
PERHAPS GROUND THE SYRIAN AIR
FORCE SO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO BE

13:23.763 --> 13:25.561
FORCE SO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO BE
DELIVERED BY AIRCRAFT.

13:25.562 --> 13:26.827
FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO BE
DELIVERED BY AIRCRAFT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T SECURE THE

BUT THAT DOESN'T SECURE THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS THEMSELVES.

13:27.962 --> 13:29.660
BUT THAT DOESN'T SECURE THE

THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE

13:29.662 --> 13:31.492

THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE
EITHER BY THE SYRIAN REBELS WHO

13:31.494 --> 13:33.658
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE
EITHER BY THE SYRIAN REBELS WHO
ARE THERE ON THE GROUND, PERHAPS

13:51.023 --> 13:53.188
STARTED TO OUTWEIGH THE COSTS OF
