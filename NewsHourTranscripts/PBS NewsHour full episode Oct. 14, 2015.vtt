WEBVTT

00:06.073 --> 00:06.740
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.775
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.775 --> 00:13.313
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: The Israeli military
deploys hundreds of troops

00:13.313 --> 00:18.151
and seals off parts of East
Jerusalem, as clashes with
Palestinians continue.

00:18.151 --> 00:22.556
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday: Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders spar on

00:22.556 --> 00:28.028
gun control, big banks and more.
We break down last night's
Democratic debate.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.466
GWEN IFILL: Then: A park
director puts his life on the
line to protect one of Congo's

00:32.466 --> 00:34.468
greatest resources,
Virunga National Park.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.672
EMMANUEL DE MERODE, Director,
Virunga National Park: There's
no park probably in the world

00:38.672 --> 00:44.077
that has so many species of
mammals, reptiles, and birds as
Virunga. That's what makes it

00:44.077 --> 00:46.113
so special.

00:46.113 --> 00:50.884
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Justice
Stephen Breyer explains why the
Supreme Court sometimes must

00:50.884 --> 00:54.187
consider laws in other countries
when making decisions about our
own.

00:54.187 --> 01:01.028
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:01.028 --> 01:05.399
(BREAK)

01:05.399 --> 01:15.976
JUDY WOODRUFF: The situation in
Syria had U.S. and Russian
military officials talking

01:15.976 --> 01:20.948
today, at least by long
distance. They discussed ways to
avoid confrontations between
warplanes

01:20.948 --> 01:24.484
crisscrossing Syrian skies.

01:24.484 --> 01:32.392
Meanwhile, the war on the ground
raged on. Rebels in Northern
Syria fought using American-made

01:32.392 --> 01:40.000
anti-tank weapons today, trying
to slow a government offensive
in Hama province. The

01:40.000 --> 01:44.638
Assad regime is taking advantage
of Russian airstrikes currently
hitting targets in Hama

01:44.638 --> 01:47.808
and Aleppo.

01:47.808 --> 01:53.981
That has raised concerns about
possible midair incidents
between U.S. and Russian pilots,

01:53.981 --> 01:58.785
and Moscow now acknowledges that
one of its planes came within a
few miles of a U.S. jet

01:58.785 --> 02:01.321
on Saturday.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.424
MAJ. GEN. IGOR KONASHENKOV,
Russian Ministry of Defense
(through translator): While
moving

02:04.424 --> 02:09.129
to the area, the plane's threat
alert system fixed on the
activity of an unknown flying

02:09.129 --> 02:12.532
object. The jet turned and
approached it, not to scare
someone, but to identify the

02:12.532 --> 02:15.702
object and whom it belongs to.

02:15.702 --> 02:21.141
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a bid to set
rules of the air, Pentagon
officials held a third round

02:21.141 --> 02:26.246
of videoconference talks with
the Russian military today, but
White House spokesman

02:26.246 --> 02:31.685
Josh Earnest confirmed there are
no plans for wider-ranging talks
on Syria.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.186
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: We have said that
we're not interested in

02:33.186 --> 02:37.824
doing that as long as Russia is
not willing to make a
constructive contribution to our

02:37.824 --> 02:40.961
counter-ISIL effort. Russia has
their own agenda, and it's an
agenda right now that

02:40.961 --> 02:43.697
they're pursuing on their own.

02:43.697 --> 02:50.871
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Iranian lawmakers visited
Syria's capital, Damascus, amid
reports

02:50.871 --> 02:56.643
that hundreds of Iranian ground
troops have joined the fight to
shore up the Assad regime.

02:56.643 --> 03:01.515
GWEN IFILL: In Iraq, government
forces say they have launched a
new offensive to recapture

03:01.515 --> 03:06.953
Baiji from the Islamic State
militants. The key northern city
sits about 90 miles south

03:06.953 --> 03:12.559
of Mosul, and is home to the
country's largest oil refinery.
Caravans of vehicles carrying

03:12.559 --> 03:17.130
Iraqi army and Shiite militia
fighters could be seen on the
move there in recent days.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.967
The city has changed hands
several times in the last year.

03:20.967 --> 03:26.440
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Iranian
nuclear deal cleared what
appears to be a final hurdle in
Tehran

03:26.440 --> 03:31.812
today. A majority of the
country's Guardian Council, made
up of both Muslim clerics and

03:31.812 --> 03:37.717
lawyers, ruled the accord does
not violate religious law. This
comes a day after Iran's

03:37.717 --> 03:41.621
legislature approved the deal,
and it means dismantling of
nuclear infrastructure can

03:41.621 --> 03:43.457
begin.

03:43.457 --> 03:48.762
GWEN IFILL: For the first time
in six years, Afghanistan may
produce less opium. A joint

03:48.762 --> 03:54.968
U.N. and Afghan survey reports
the acreage planted in opium
poppies is down 19 percent.

03:54.968 --> 04:00.407
Officials say that's due mainly
to bad weather, but also to a
change in how farmed areas are

04:00.407 --> 04:03.477
measured. As a result, the
country's potential output of
opium could fall by nearly half

04:03.477 --> 04:05.879
this year.

04:05.879 --> 04:10.784
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pope Francis
apologized today for what he
called scandals that have
recently

04:10.784 --> 04:15.021
occurred in the church. The
pontiff spoke during a general
audience for the public at

04:15.021 --> 04:19.826
the Vatican. He didn't elaborate
or cite any examples.

04:19.826 --> 04:27.534
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator): The
word of Jesus is strong today.

04:27.534 --> 04:32.739
He says it is inevitable that
there will be scandals. But woe
to the man who causes them.

04:32.739 --> 04:36.376
Therefore, I ask for forgiveness
for the scandals that have
occurred recently either in Rome

04:36.376 --> 04:39.646
or in the Vatican. I ask
you for forgiveness.

04:39.646 --> 04:44.818
JUDY WOODRUFF: A spokesman
wouldn't specify which incidents
the pope had in mind. They

04:44.818 --> 04:49.556
may have involved a monsignor
who was fired after he announced
he was gay or a priest

04:49.556 --> 04:52.726
who said children are at
fault for pedophilia.

04:52.726 --> 04:59.533
GWEN IFILL: Volkswagen now says
its 2016 diesel models contain
even more software that could

04:59.533 --> 05:05.272
cheat on emissions tests. The
company says it told the
Environmental Protection Agency

05:05.272 --> 05:10.443
last week. The information
didn't appear in V.W.'s initial
applications to meet U.S.
emissions

05:10.443 --> 05:16.216
standards. For now, thousands of
2016 Volkswagens are quarantined
at U.S. ports.

05:16.216 --> 05:21.421
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Toyota
announced that it hopes to
eliminate nearly all
gasoline-powered

05:21.421 --> 05:28.562
vehicles from its lineup by
2050. Instead, it's shifting to
hybrids and fuel cell technology

05:28.562 --> 05:33.266
that converts hydrogen into
energy and water. Toyota aims to
cut emissions from its cars

05:33.266 --> 05:36.903
by 90 percent below 2010 levels.

05:36.903 --> 05:41.875
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
stocks gave ground after
Wal-Mart issued a warning about

05:41.875 --> 05:49.216
future profits. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 157
points to close below 16925. The

05:49.216 --> 05:54.054
Nasdaq fell 13 points, and
the S&P 500 slipped nine.

05:54.054 --> 05:58.959
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": simmering
tensions in the Middle East;
Supreme

05:58.959 --> 06:04.364
Court Justice Stephen Breyer's
new book, "The Court and the
World": Gwen sits down with

06:04.364 --> 06:13.240
Ta-Nehisi Coates to get his take
mass incarceration, and much
more.

06:13.240 --> 06:25.819
GWEN IFILL: Violence and
counterviolence continued today
in Israel. Israeli police
reported that

06:25.819 --> 06:30.657
an Arab attacker stabbed a
70-year-old woman near
Jerusalem's Central Bus Station,
while,

06:30.657 --> 06:35.829
in Bethlehem, dozens of
Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli troops.

06:35.829 --> 06:40.667
Over the past two weeks, 32
Palestinians and seven Israelis
have been killed. And each

06:40.667 --> 06:44.137
side blames the other for
this latest outbreak.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.641
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Martin Seemungal is in
Jerusalem. I spoke with him a
short

06:47.641 --> 06:48.541
while ago.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.444
Martin, welcome.

06:51.444 --> 06:55.248
So, tell us today what the mood
and the atmosphere is like in
Jerusalem.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.685
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Well, it's
a very tense situation.

06:58.685 --> 07:06.326
We have had a few days of these
so-called lone wolf terror
attacks, knifings of Jews

07:06.326 --> 07:11.164
on the streets here in Jerusalem
and some other parts of Israel.
And that's got people

07:11.164 --> 07:14.701
extremely nervous, people
looking over their should, not
knowing when the potential next

07:14.701 --> 07:16.936
attack could come.

07:16.936 --> 07:24.644
There was one, as we talked
about in -- just outside the Old
City, an attack, an attempt

07:24.644 --> 07:32.419
on -- attack on an Israeli
security guard. The perpetrator
was shot. And then, of course,

07:32.419 --> 07:37.590
the attack at the bus station,
where a 70-year-old woman was
stabbed, and that perpetrator
was

07:37.590 --> 07:41.895
shot. Those kinds of things
only add to the tension here.

07:41.895 --> 07:47.033
Amid all that, Benjamin
Netanyahu and the Israeli
government making good on its
promise

07:47.033 --> 07:53.006
to crack down in these areas, in
these Arab areas where the
attackers have come from.

07:53.006 --> 07:58.745
So, we have seen an entire
neighborhood, an Arab
neighborhood called Jabel
Mukaber, cut

07:58.745 --> 08:03.850
off. We have had checkpoints put
up. And we see people being
searched.

08:03.850 --> 08:11.591
The rest of East Jerusalem not
as sealed off as we had thought
it would be. However, we

08:11.591 --> 08:17.163
do see roadblocks that we hadn't
seen before. Obviously, the
Israelis trying to make a point

08:17.163 --> 08:23.937
that they're going to punish
people in those areas where
those attackers came from.

08:23.937 --> 08:31.077
Also, the Israeli government
talking about destroying the
homes of the terrorists, also

08:31.077 --> 08:37.684
talking about stripping them of
their residency, and even
there's a discussion that the
bodies

08:37.684 --> 08:44.057
of the attackers who have been
killed, obviously, are not going
to be given back to the
families,

08:44.057 --> 08:49.529
the Israeli government saying,
when they do that, all that does
is give an opportunity

08:49.529 --> 08:54.267
to support terror, and these
funerals become a celebration of
terror.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.303
So, the Israelis say they
don't want to do that.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.140
GWEN IFILL: So, what has been
the Palestinian reaction, not
only on the streets, but also

09:00.140 --> 09:02.142
in the government?

09:02.142 --> 09:08.982
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Well, the
Palestinians are saying these
actions by the Israelis in East

09:08.982 --> 09:13.753
Jerusalem are unprecedented, and
they see it as collective
punishment.

09:13.753 --> 09:19.659
Mahmoud Abbas made a statement
today on Palestinian television
where he said: We have the right

09:19.659 --> 09:24.297
to peaceful protest. We're going
to continue to stand up to the
occupation.

09:24.297 --> 09:30.170
He didn't mention anything about
the terror attacks in recent
days. That raised some eyebrows

09:30.170 --> 09:36.176
here in Israel. He talked about
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which, as we
know, has been a source

09:36.176 --> 09:41.114
of great concern among the
Palestinians. They feel that the
Israelis are trying to change

09:41.114 --> 09:44.617
the status quo on the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, and they're accusing the
Israeli government of

09:44.617 --> 09:47.620
trying to do that.

09:47.620 --> 09:52.058
The Israeli government responded
very swiftly to that, saying --
this evening, saying that

09:52.058 --> 09:57.430
Mahmoud Abbas is only adding to
the incitement and spreading
lies among the Palestinian
population

09:57.430 --> 09:59.732
and only making things worse.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.302
GWEN IFILL: You used the term
lone wolf to describe these
attacks and counterattacks

10:02.302 --> 10:04.904
at the top here.

10:04.904 --> 10:10.577
It seems like this is a little
different. There's a viral
aspect to these attacks and

10:10.577 --> 10:13.012
the degree to which people
act and counter-react.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.749
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Absolutely.

10:16.749 --> 10:22.455
And, you know, that viral aspect
on social media, whenever
there's an attack, it spreads

10:22.455 --> 10:29.162
on social media, and each side
has its own narrative as to
what's behind it. The
Palestinians

10:29.162 --> 10:35.668
say that the Israelis are
treating some of the people who
were the attackers very badly.

10:35.668 --> 10:41.174
We saw that video yesterday of
the young boy on the ground, the
Israelis saying that these

10:41.174 --> 10:46.012
are terrorists, they're being
whipped up by the Palestinian
leadership.

10:46.012 --> 10:52.018
And, as a result, this just
keeps going on and on. And, you
know, we have this attempt

10:52.018 --> 10:57.056
by the Israeli government to try
to put a lid on this with these
checkpoints and deploying

10:57.056 --> 11:02.195
more troops and whatnot. But one
of those attackers today, the
one outside the Old City,

11:02.195 --> 11:06.866
for example, didn't come from
anywhere in the Jerusalem area.
He came from Hebron.

11:06.866 --> 11:12.605
So, these attacks are very
unpredictable, and, as far as we
can tell, they're not organized.

11:12.605 --> 11:16.643
So, that is very difficult for
the Israelis to try and put a
stop to it.

11:16.643 --> 11:23.116
GWEN IFILL: Martin Seemungal
reporting for us tonight from
Jerusalem, thank you.

11:23.116 --> 11:35.361
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
candidates for president got
back on the campaign trail today

11:35.361 --> 11:39.365
after an issues-packed
debate last night.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.369
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports on what we
learned from their first
five-way

11:43.369 --> 11:46.072
face-to-face encounter.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.708
ANDERSON COOPER, Moderator:
Please welcome the Democratic
candidates for president of

11:48.708 --> 11:50.910
the United States.

11:50.910 --> 11:56.749
LISA DESJARDINS: The five-person
Las Vegas stage quickly morphed
into a two-person heavyweight

11:56.749 --> 12:01.487
match, as Democratic socialist
Bernie Sanders was asked if he
is also a capitalist.

12:01.487 --> 12:05.325
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: Do I
consider myself part of the
casino capitalist

12:05.325 --> 12:12.265
process, by which so few have so
much, and so many have so
little, by which Wall Street's

12:12.265 --> 12:16.669
greed and recklessness wrecked
this economy? No, I don't.

12:16.669 --> 12:21.040
LISA DESJARDINS: It was a
symbolic start to a policy
deep-debate, and Hillary Clinton

12:21.040 --> 12:24.711
moved to critique, but
defend the system.

12:24.711 --> 12:28.381
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: It's our
job to rein in the excesses of
capitalism,

12:28.381 --> 12:31.417
but we would be making a grave
mistake to turn our backs on
what built the greatest

12:31.417 --> 12:33.119
middle class in the
history of the world.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.354
ANDERSON COOPER:
Senator Sanders?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.956
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton
pointed to her experience.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.692
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm a
progressive. But I'm a
progressive who likes to get
things

12:39.692 --> 12:44.597
done. And I know...

12:44.597 --> 12:45.932
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:45.932 --> 12:46.466
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: ... how
to find common ground, and I
know how to stand my ground,

12:46.466 --> 12:50.069
and I have proved that in every
position that I have had.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.972
LISA DESJARDINS: She soon went
on offense, highlighting
Sanders' vote against a
prominent

12:52.972 --> 12:55.475
gun control bill.

12:55.475 --> 13:00.813
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Senator
Sanders did vote five times
against the Brady Bill. Since

13:00.813 --> 13:05.485
it was passed, more than two
million prohibited purchases
have been prevented.

13:05.485 --> 13:09.022
LISA DESJARDINS: The Vermont
senator insisted he, too, wants
gun control, but he argued

13:09.022 --> 13:11.924
the issue is complicated.

13:11.924 --> 13:18.865
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: As a
senator from a rural state, what
I can tell Secretary Clinton,

13:18.865 --> 13:25.071
that all the shouting in the
world is not going to do what I
would hope all of us want,

13:25.071 --> 13:29.542
and that is keep guns out of the
hands of people who shouldn't
have those guns and end

13:29.542 --> 13:32.412
this horrible violence
that we are seeing.

13:32.412 --> 13:36.382
LISA DESJARDINS: The two rivals
did unite for a marquee moment
on Clinton's use of a

13:36.382 --> 13:39.385
private e-mail server
as secretary of state.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.920
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
have taken responsibility for
it. I did say it was a

13:40.920 --> 13:42.722
mistake.

13:42.722 --> 13:48.127
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I think the
secretary is right, and that is
that the American people

13:48.127 --> 13:50.530
are sick and tired of hearing
about your damn e-mails.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.597
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:51.597 --> 13:52.799
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
Thank you. Me too. Me too.

13:52.799 --> 13:53.132
(LAUGHTER)

13:53.132 --> 13:55.201
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:55.201 --> 13:59.405
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton and
Sanders dominated. Each spoke
for about 30 minutes, according

13:59.405 --> 14:04.977
to "NewsHour"'s analysis, twice
as long as anyone else on stage.

14:04.977 --> 14:08.681
Former Maryland Governor Martin
O'Malley tried for a share of
the spotlight, hitting Clinton

14:08.681 --> 14:13.052
for not pushing to separate big
banks and investment firms.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.687
MARTIN O'MALLEY (D),
Presidential Candidate: You are
not for putting a firewall
between

14:14.687 --> 14:17.457
this speculative, risky
shadow banking behavior.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.292
LISA DESJARDINS:
Sanders jumped in.

14:19.292 --> 14:19.392
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: When
you have the three...

14:19.392 --> 14:21.127
ANDERSON COOPER: Senator...

14:21.127 --> 14:25.031
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: ... largest
banks in America are much bigger
than they were when

14:25.031 --> 14:29.936
we bailed them out for being too
big to fail, we have got to
break them up.

14:29.936 --> 14:35.508
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton
wouldn't go that far, but said
that banks need strong scrutiny.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.345
On either side of the stage, two
other opponents struggled to be
heard.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.013
JIM WEBB (D), Presidential
Candidate: I have been waiting
for 10 minutes. I will say this.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.082
ANDERSON COOPER:
You're over your time.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.519
LISA DESJARDINS: Former Virginia
Senator Jim Webb and former
Rhode Island Senator and
Governor

14:46.519 --> 14:51.724
Lincoln Chafee spoke their
minds, but landed few punches.

14:51.724 --> 14:57.096
Voters can next judge the
Democratic hopefuls side by side
one month from today in Des
Moines.

14:57.096 --> 15:05.037
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

15:05.037 --> 15:19.986
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Supreme Court
of the United States is often
the final say on the major

15:19.986 --> 15:25.358
domestic conflicts of the day,
from voting rights to gay
marriage and health care.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.928
But when foreign law crosses
paths with our legal system, how
should the Supreme Court

15:28.928 --> 15:31.497
proceed?

15:31.497 --> 15:35.868
Justice Stephen Breyer, who has
served on the court for over two
decades, examines this

15:35.868 --> 15:40.940
in his new book, "The Court and
the World: American Law and the
New Global Realities."

15:40.940 --> 15:42.708
And Justice Breyer joins me now.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.110
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

15:44.110 --> 15:44.710
STEPHEN BREYER, Associate
Justice, U.S. Supreme Court:
Thank you very much.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.979
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's great
to have you with us.

15:46.979 --> 15:52.151
So, with so many complicated
issues before this Supreme
Court, why did you take the time

15:52.151 --> 15:56.122
to focus on how it's affected by
what's going on in other
countries?

15:56.122 --> 16:00.660
STEPHEN BREYER: Well, I have
noticed that, over the course of
the last 20 years, we have

16:00.660 --> 16:08.501
more and more cases, maybe now
15 or 20 percent, where what
goes on beyond our shores is
directly

16:08.501 --> 16:14.173
relevant to our making a sound
decision on the American legal
question before us.

16:14.173 --> 16:20.680
They range from security
problems, Guantanamo, to human
rights problems, victims of
tortures,

16:20.680 --> 16:26.886
to commercial problems,
copyright, antitrust, securities
law, domestic relations,
marriages

16:26.886 --> 16:31.157
that are governed by treaty.
They're all over the place.

16:31.157 --> 16:36.929
And I wanted to show people,
concretely, in the case of our
institution, what that general

16:36.929 --> 16:40.032
word, interdependence, means.

16:40.032 --> 16:45.605
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just to
bore down on this a little bit,
you start out looking at

16:45.605 --> 16:50.576
some cases involving national
security and, in some regards,
striking a balance between

16:50.576 --> 16:54.347
national security,
civil liberties.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.985
Why should the U.S. be concerned
with what foreign countries are
doing when deciding

16:58.985 --> 17:01.454
important questions like that?

17:01.454 --> 17:05.791
STEPHEN BREYER: We didn't have
to be, our court, for a long
time. We didn't have to

17:05.791 --> 17:12.632
be in that area, because for
dozens and dozens and dozens of
years, the court simply stayed

17:12.632 --> 17:18.804
out of the effort to balance
security interests, which was
the president's job, against
human

17:18.804 --> 17:24.043
rights or limitations
on civil rights.

17:24.043 --> 17:30.283
That led to a case in World War
II where 70,000 Americans of
Japanese origin were put into

17:30.283 --> 17:35.388
camps in the center of the
country, prison camps, for no
reason, no good reason, and

17:35.388 --> 17:39.058
the court upheld it.

17:39.058 --> 17:45.564
Since that time, most people who
study these matters think that
was a terrible decision,

17:45.564 --> 17:52.204
and, therefore, the court gets
involved. So, in Guantanamo
case, in those four cases, we

17:52.204 --> 17:57.710
held in favor of the prisoner
prisoners in Guantanamo. And
Sandra O'Connor wrote these

17:57.710 --> 18:06.852
words: "The Constitution doesn't
write a blank check to the
president to run over civil
rights,

18:06.852 --> 18:10.122
even when national
security is at issue."

18:10.122 --> 18:16.562
Once you hear those words, blank
check, you have to ask, how do
we fill the check in?

18:16.562 --> 18:22.535
And to know the answer to that
today involves knowing something
about security problems.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.973
It involves knowing about
something involving terrorism,
which takes place abroad. It
involves

18:26.973 --> 18:30.443
knowing how other countries
deal with those problems.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.880
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also bring up
the death penalty, and this
arose in a case the court

18:34.880 --> 18:37.883
dealt with this year.

18:37.883 --> 18:42.688
You wrote in your -- and you
included in the dissenting
opinion in that case -- you
cited

18:42.688 --> 18:47.893
the fact that most countries on
Earth don't have the death
penalty anymore, either by

18:47.893 --> 18:52.365
law or by practice. Again,
why is that relevant here?

18:52.365 --> 18:57.203
STEPHEN BREYER: Well, it --
there's a debate on how relevant
it is.

18:57.203 --> 19:05.644
The relevant constitutional
provision forbids punishments
that are cruel and unusual. The

19:05.644 --> 19:10.883
founders didn't say whether that
meant unusual in the United
States or unusual in the world.

19:10.883 --> 19:16.355
So, some people think that's
quite relevant. Other people
think it isn't so relevant.

19:16.355 --> 19:22.762
I put that in, in the opinion to
show that we are virtually
alone, but some other countries

19:22.762 --> 19:29.502
have it. Nonetheless, that
wasn't my main basis for the
conclusion. The conclusion was,

19:29.502 --> 19:35.107
we should hear the question of
whether the death penalty is
unconstitutional. And there

19:35.107 --> 19:43.749
were other reasons.
Arbitrariness, wrong person,
long delays, the diminished
number of cases

19:43.749 --> 19:48.621
in the United States, just a
handful, where death is actually
carried out, those were

19:48.621 --> 19:51.757
the basic reasons I thought we
should reconsider the question.

19:51.757 --> 19:57.463
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of your
-- well, four of your more
conservative colleagues on the

19:57.463 --> 20:02.601
court have made it very clear
they're troubled by the idea of
being influenced by foreign

20:02.601 --> 20:05.805
law.

20:05.805 --> 20:11.444
In a number of cases over the
years, this has come up. It's
come up in Congress when

20:11.444 --> 20:17.450
members of -- nominees to the
Supreme Court have been seeking
confirmation. Do you think

20:17.450 --> 20:21.153
that kind of implacable
opposition to paying attention
to foreign law is softening
among

20:21.153 --> 20:23.422
some of your colleagues?

20:23.422 --> 20:27.026
STEPHEN BREYER: Yes, for this
reason, in this respect, and
that's one reason I wrote this

20:27.026 --> 20:30.196
book.

20:30.196 --> 20:37.803
If you look at the cases
actually before us, they're much
different and often far more

20:37.803 --> 20:44.577
mundane, but perhaps very
important, than death penalty
cases. They involve, for
example,

20:44.577 --> 20:49.281
treaties, which deal with what?
Which deal with marriages that
failed and abduction of

20:49.281 --> 20:53.719
children across boundaries.

20:53.719 --> 21:01.460
Why do we have those treaties?
Because, today, marriage is more
and more international. And

21:01.460 --> 21:08.033
who interprets treaties? We do.
The federal courts do. And when
we interpret them, do

21:08.033 --> 21:14.340
we pay attention to what other
countries have said is the right
meaning of the treaty?
Absolutely.

21:14.340 --> 21:20.846
And you can find in all of -- I
think that's a unanimous view.
So, there are many issues

21:20.846 --> 21:26.085
where of course you have to take
into account foreign matters.
And that's what I want to

21:26.085 --> 21:28.687
show has become more and
more of our business.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.624
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
-- and one of the reasons you
wrote the book was to influence

21:31.624 --> 21:33.859
your fellow justices.

21:33.859 --> 21:38.297
STEPHEN BREYER: No, I'm just
saying I want the ordinary --
the ordinary reader -- and

21:38.297 --> 21:45.838
I prefer, you know, people read
this -- contrary to popular
belief, of our 315 million
citizens,

21:45.838 --> 21:47.806
314 million are not lawyers.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.375
(LAUGHTER)

21:49.375 --> 21:51.810
STEPHEN BREYER: And I would like
them to have a chance, too, to
know what goes on in the

21:51.810 --> 21:53.179
court.

21:53.179 --> 21:57.516
JUDY WOODRUFF: A broader
question about the court,
Justice Breyer.

21:57.516 --> 22:01.987
Critics on the right, some of
them are now saying this court
has become too activist.

22:01.987 --> 22:07.660
Among other things, they're
pointing to the ruling in
support of same-sex marriage.
They're

22:07.660 --> 22:12.565
saying, why should the Supreme
Court be intervening itself in
an area where the public is
still

22:12.565 --> 22:14.867
sorting itself out?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.570
How do you answer
that? Is the court...

22:17.570 --> 22:21.674
STEPHEN BREYER: Everyone -- and
everyone has a right to
criticize the court. And, oddly

22:21.674 --> 22:29.281
enough, what we do, the nine
members, rarely try to respond
to the criticism.

22:29.281 --> 22:36.989
Why? Because our job, our job,
which we take very, very
seriously, our job is to look at

22:36.989 --> 22:44.096
the individual case in front of
us, to read perhaps a dozen,
perhaps 100 briefs that have

22:44.096 --> 22:50.936
been filed on the two sides, to
try to understand, through the
argument, written and oral, and

22:50.936 --> 22:56.976
discussion in the court, where
the right answer lies and try to
write as best we can our real

22:56.976 --> 23:01.580
reasons for reaching the
conclusions that we reached.

23:01.580 --> 23:08.954
Now, we take that job seriously.
David Souter said, we are never
off-duty. And we're not.

23:08.954 --> 23:15.928
And that is what we must
continue to do. And, ultimately,
I believe -- and others --
Justice

23:15.928 --> 23:21.634
Brandeis believed this -- that
the best hope for maintaining
the respect for the court

23:21.634 --> 23:27.339
that is necessary for our
Constitution to work is just do
your job.

23:27.339 --> 23:31.744
JUDY WOODRUFF: Justice Stephen
Breyer, the book is "The Court
and the World: American

23:31.744 --> 23:34.480
Law and the New
Global Realities."

23:34.480 --> 23:36.248
We thank you very much for
coming to sit down and talk to
us. Thank you.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.586
STEPHEN BREYER: Thank you.

23:40.586 --> 23:50.996
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

23:50.996 --> 23:56.068
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what's killing some of
California's oldest and largest
trees;

23:56.068 --> 24:01.173
one man's mission to protect
Congo's gorillas amid decades of
war; and a fashion photographer

24:01.173 --> 24:06.045
on what clothes do and don't say
about the people wearing them.

24:06.045 --> 24:11.917
But, first, another take on our
legal system, this time, a
conversation with the writer

24:11.917 --> 24:16.855
who is among the newest class of
MacArthur fellows, and today was
named a finalist for

24:16.855 --> 24:21.560
a National Book Award for his
writing about race, crime and
punishment.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.698
The book is "Between the World
and Me," and his latest
contribution to "The Atlantic"

24:25.698 --> 24:29.034
magazine examines the black
family in the age of mass
incarceration.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.569
Ta-Nehisi Coates joins me now.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.037
Welcome.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.939
TA-NEHISI COATES, "The
Atlantic": Thanks for having me,
Gwen.

24:33.939 --> 24:37.710
GWEN IFILL: It's a very, very
long magazine article, probably
one of the longest, if not

24:37.710 --> 24:38.610
the longest, that "Atlantic"
has ever published.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.713
TA-NEHISI COATES: Yes.

24:40.713 --> 24:44.983
GWEN IFILL: And in it and in
your book and in a magazine
article you wrote last year

24:44.983 --> 24:50.856
about reparations, it seems to
reveal an ongoing sense of deep
pessimism, not only about
America,

24:50.856 --> 24:52.458
but especially about
African-Americans.

24:52.458 --> 24:57.062
TA-NEHISI COATES: Well, I
wouldn't call it pessimistic.

24:57.062 --> 25:02.735
I would call it, if I can use
the word, realpolitik is
probably a word that I would
actually use.

25:02.735 --> 25:07.172
I think there's a way of looking
at African-American life and
looking at the long struggle
against

25:07.172 --> 25:12.544
racism in this country that is
current within our politics, and
then there's a whole different

25:12.544 --> 25:15.414
way that people talk about when
I go talk to academics, when I
go talk to sociologists,

25:15.414 --> 25:18.617
and when I talk to historians.

25:18.617 --> 25:23.055
And that world, I guess, some
would feel is pessimistic. I
don't think it's pessimistic,

25:23.055 --> 25:29.328
because I think any struggle
worth having takes place across
generations. And so one

25:29.328 --> 25:32.965
of the things that, if that work
does anything, it forgoes the
possibility of great and
tremendous

25:32.965 --> 25:35.601
change within our lifetime.

25:35.601 --> 25:39.271
But, you know, it's not so
pessimistic about the long term,
I don't think.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.407
GWEN IFILL: But when you talk
about the gray wastes...

25:41.407 --> 25:43.075
TA-NEHISI COATES: Right.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.644
GWEN IFILL: ... that is not an
optimistic term. Explain what it
is, first of all.

25:45.644 --> 25:45.744
TA-NEHISI COATES:
Well, it's prison.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.746
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.848
TA-NEHISI COATES: I mean, the
gray wastes is a description of
our sprawling jail and

25:49.848 --> 25:53.018
prison system.

25:53.018 --> 25:58.924
I was looking for some sort of
terminology that, as far as I
could see accurately reflected,

25:58.924 --> 26:02.494
not just in terms of hard
numbers, but compelled people to
feel what it was. And the gray
wastes

26:02.494 --> 26:06.031
is what I settle on.

26:06.031 --> 26:10.302
When you write about mass
incarceration, when you write
about housing discrimination, as

26:10.302 --> 26:15.040
I was writing about in the case
of reparations, when you write
about death at the hands of

26:15.040 --> 26:19.745
the police, as I was in "Between
the World and Me," the language
does not tend to happy

26:19.745 --> 26:22.714
fun time. It tends to be hard.

26:22.714 --> 26:25.617
GWEN IFILL: Which is why I'm
surprised you don't see it as
pessimistic.

26:25.617 --> 26:26.452
But let's get back to that.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.053
TA-NEHISI COATES: OK.

26:28.053 --> 26:33.125
GWEN IFILL: Because you frame
this particular article with --
you use Daniel Patrick Moynihan,

26:33.125 --> 26:38.997
the senator from New York, to
frame this. He, in 1965, wrote a
very famous report on

26:38.997 --> 26:40.532
the state of the Negro family,
as it was called then.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.334
TA-NEHISI COATES: Right, right.

26:42.334 --> 26:47.239
GWEN IFILL: He played a role not
only in writing that, but also
on the other end, in creating

26:47.239 --> 26:49.741
some of the problems you
say continue to exist.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.376
TA-NEHISI COATES: Right, right.

26:51.376 --> 26:55.848
Well, in 1965, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan does this report on the
black family. Daniel Patrick

26:55.848 --> 26:59.418
Moynihan is very, very
sympathetic to the black family,
very, very sympathetic to black

26:59.418 --> 27:04.756
people in general and to the
problem of race in this country.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.927
He was arguing -- you know,
effectively, he used the family
as the lens to look at the

27:08.927 --> 27:14.900
community, assembled all these
social economic indicators to
show where black families were

27:14.900 --> 27:19.972
as compared to the rest, and
hoped that what would follow was
benevolent investment.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.308
The argument that I make in the
piece is that, in fact, what
followed was malevolent
investment,

27:23.308 --> 27:27.312
that a lot of problems that
Daniel Patrick Moynihan was
dealing with in that report,

27:27.312 --> 27:32.818
we basically outsourced to our
prison system, instead of our
normal social service system.

27:32.818 --> 27:36.722
And the piece is all about why
we did that. And, regrettably,
some of that is within -- some

27:36.722 --> 27:40.125
of the reason why we did that
can be seen within the history
of Daniel Moynihan himself.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.428
GWEN IFILL: You make a
connection between the tangle of
pathology that he famously wrote

27:43.428 --> 27:43.795
about...

27:43.795 --> 27:45.297
TA-NEHISI COATES: Right.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.500
GWEN IFILL: ... and the tangle
of perils that African-American
men mostly face now.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.435
TA-NEHISI COATES:
Right, right, right.

27:50.435 --> 27:56.108
And I wanted to be clear about
the difference. You know, the
pathology summons these notions

27:56.108 --> 27:59.778
of a diseased patient, of
somebody that is afflicted. And,
for me, whenever I'm writing

27:59.778 --> 28:04.316
about racism, again, through all
three of these pieces, I think
people shouldn't lose

28:04.316 --> 28:07.886
sight of the fact that
it's a done thing.

28:07.886 --> 28:12.124
And the tangles of peril, I felt
better conveyed the notion that
somebody had done certain

28:12.124 --> 28:15.294
things, that we had made certain
decisions about housing in this
country, that we had

28:15.294 --> 28:19.565
made certain decisions about how
we were going to punish certain
crimes in this country,

28:19.565 --> 28:23.101
that we make decisions about any
number of things in terms of how
we're going to invest

28:23.101 --> 28:25.837
our resources as a country.
And that has effects.

28:25.837 --> 28:31.209
GWEN IFILL: You make a case, a
connection between the efforts
we took to fix crime,

28:31.209 --> 28:37.316
whether it was three strikes
you're out, or whether it was
just the war on drugs, and

28:37.316 --> 28:40.018
you made that connection to that
and mass incarceration as we see
it now.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.955
TA-NEHISI COATES: Yes.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.925
What we had, and certainly you
can't get away from the fact
that we did have a crime rise

28:46.925 --> 28:53.065
in this country beginning in the
early '70s and proceeding into
the '80s and into and

28:53.065 --> 28:55.434
beginning to level off as you
get into the '90s, until it
started to plunge, really,

28:55.434 --> 28:58.770
really plunge in the late
'90s and into the 2000s.

28:58.770 --> 29:02.441
And, oftentimes, that's the
argument we get for how we ended
up with so many people in

29:02.441 --> 29:06.345
jail. The problem, of course, is
that the crime rise and the
subsequent fall that happened

29:06.345 --> 29:11.416
at the middle to the end of the
20th century actually is an
international phenomena.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.286
Same thing happened in Canada.
Same thing happened in Great
Britain. Same thing happened

29:14.286 --> 29:19.625
across much of Europe. America
is unique in mass incarceration,
nevertheless. Everybody

29:19.625 --> 29:23.762
didn't choose that as the answer
for how they were going to deal
with policy.

29:23.762 --> 29:28.033
We made that decision. And my
argument is that you can't
divorce that from the history

29:28.033 --> 29:31.336
of looking at black people as
though they have some sort of
predilection towards
criminality.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.172
GWEN IFILL: Now, this won't be
the first time you have been
asked this question. What about

29:34.172 --> 29:37.643
personal responsibility? What
about the fact that numbers seem
to show that African-Americans

29:37.643 --> 29:40.145
commit more crimes?

29:40.145 --> 29:42.848
TA-NEHISI COATES:
African-Americans do commit more
crimes. There's just no -- no
one can

29:42.848 --> 29:46.084
really make a -- have a -- as a
percentage of the population of
the country. There's

29:46.084 --> 29:48.720
no way to get away from that.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.591
GWEN IFILL: So, why is that the
nation's responsibility to fix
it, if the community won't fix
it itself?

29:52.591 --> 29:55.127
TA-NEHISI COATES: Because the
conversation doesn't end there.

29:55.127 --> 30:00.265
The conversation then has to
become, why is that? Can it be
said that African-American

30:00.265 --> 30:03.335
communities are the same as all
other communities? Can it be
said that African-American
communities

30:03.335 --> 30:07.339
have the same amount of
resources as all other
communities? Can it be said that
African-American

30:07.339 --> 30:10.275
-- that other communities, like
African-American communities,
have the same history of people

30:10.275 --> 30:13.979
extracting resources out
of their community?

30:13.979 --> 30:18.116
If you look at the policy, what
the policies have been towards
the African-American community

30:18.116 --> 30:21.887
historically in this country,
that there's more crime in
African-American communities

30:21.887 --> 30:25.457
doesn't, you know,
come as a surprise.

30:25.457 --> 30:29.561
African-Americans in general
tend to live in more
criminogenic conditions than
other

30:29.561 --> 30:33.532
communities. And so the fact
that, you know, crime actually
occurs, you know, more likely

30:33.532 --> 30:35.233
in those communities shouldn't
come as a particular surprise to
anyone.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.469
GWEN IFILL: What
are the solutions?

30:37.469 --> 30:40.205
TA-NEHISI COATES: Well, I think
the first thing to do, as I have
argued in my case for

30:40.205 --> 30:42.374
reparations, is reparations.

30:42.374 --> 30:46.211
And I know that doesn't quite
sound like a solution to
everybody because it can't be

30:46.211 --> 30:50.282
done right now. But I believe
it's a long-term solution,
because the basic problem, the
basic

30:50.282 --> 30:52.818
problem in this country with
black people and with white
people is that you have a huge

30:52.818 --> 30:55.220
discrepancy in wealth.

30:55.220 --> 30:59.991
And the easiest way, though not
the only way, I can demonstrate
that is the huge wealth

30:59.991 --> 31:04.763
gap. For every dollar of wealth
that a white family has,
African-American families have

31:04.763 --> 31:09.935
a nickel. That is not a mistake.
That is not the result of magic.

31:09.935 --> 31:14.172
That is the result of done
policy. That is the result of,
you know, a long history of

31:14.172 --> 31:18.310
enslavement in this country,
followed by Jim Crow, which was
the extraction of resources,

31:18.310 --> 31:22.180
followed by erecting loan
policies for home loans in this
country that African-Americans

31:22.180 --> 31:25.250
were not given access to,
followed by a safety net policy
that black people did not have

31:25.250 --> 31:28.120
the same access to.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.190
It just does not make sense that
you would have that, and then
not do nothing, and then

31:32.190 --> 31:35.293
expect that everything is going
to go away, that everything is
going to be all right.

31:35.293 --> 31:38.230
GWEN IFILL: Ta-Nehisi Coates,
congratulations on your honors
that you have gotten recently.

31:38.230 --> 31:38.830
TA-NEHISI COATES:
Thank you. Thank you.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.098
GWEN IFILL: And thank
you for talking to us.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.300
TA-NEHISI COATES:
Thank you, Gwen.

31:42.300 --> 31:46.671
GWEN IFILL: On tomorrow's
program, we continue our look at
mass incarceration, this time

31:46.671 --> 31:51.877
from the prisoner's perspective.
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham was granted rare access
to

31:51.877 --> 31:56.114
a maximum security jail in
Maryland where a unique pilot
program is trying to put a

31:56.114 --> 31:59.451
stop to the revolving
prison door.

31:59.451 --> 32:08.260
MAN: This idea that solely,
solely taking someone's freedom
away changes behavior, in

32:08.260 --> 32:10.195
many cases, it changes it for
the worse. And that's not what
America's correctional
facilities

32:10.195 --> 32:16.334
were founded on.

32:16.334 --> 32:28.013
JUDY WOODRUFF: California's
historic drought has created a
long list of problems for the

32:28.013 --> 32:33.985
Golden State, including killing
millions of trees in the Sierra
Nevada Mountain Range.

32:33.985 --> 32:38.857
Now even the iconic giant
sequoias, which can live
thousands of years, are starting

32:38.857 --> 32:42.594
to show signs that they're
not getting enough water.

32:42.594 --> 32:48.633
Our colleagues at public TV
station KQED in San Francisco
joined a team of biologists

32:48.633 --> 32:52.504
from the University of
California, Berkeley, as they
climbed 50 of these giant trees
this

32:52.504 --> 32:56.007
summer in Sequoia National Park.

32:56.007 --> 33:02.314
The story was produced by
Gabriela Quiros and narrated by
Scott Shafer.

33:02.314 --> 33:08.453
SCOTT SHAFER: Anthony Ambrose is
climbing this giant sequoia to
find out how it's faring

33:08.453 --> 33:11.323
after four years of drought.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.793
ANTHONY AMBROSE, University of
California, Berkeley: We are at
about 240 feet at the

33:14.793 --> 33:18.597
top of a giant sequoia tree.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.933
SCOTT SHAFER: These leaves will
tell him how stressed out the
tree is due to the lack of

33:21.933 --> 33:23.602
water.

33:23.602 --> 33:28.540
ANTHONY AMBROSE: You need to
measure them kind of at the most
relaxed time of the day,

33:28.540 --> 33:33.478
before the sun rises, before
they start to lose water to the
atmosphere. They require

33:33.478 --> 33:37.249
an enormous amount of water, way
more than any other tree that
has ever been documented.

33:37.249 --> 33:41.786
SCOTT SHAFER: His colleague
Wendy Baxter is near the top of
another giant sequoia.

33:41.786 --> 33:45.423
WENDY BAXTER, University of
California, Berkeley: Giant
sequoias are just such special
trees.

33:45.423 --> 33:50.896
They have been able to persist
and live in this exact place
maybe for thousands of years.

33:50.896 --> 33:54.466
Some of them live to
be 3,000 years old.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.969
SCOTT SHAFER: Over the course of
their long lives, sequoias can
grow as tall as a 30-story

33:57.969 --> 33:59.437
building.

33:59.437 --> 34:03.008
WENDY BAXTER: Well, there's
a beautiful view up here.

34:03.008 --> 34:06.811
SCOTT SHAFER: Even at these
great heights, leaves contain
water.

34:06.811 --> 34:13.051
WENDY BAXTER: There is higher
concentrations of water in the
soil than in the air. So,

34:13.051 --> 34:18.490
that gradient is actually
pulling the water up through the
tree.

34:18.490 --> 34:23.628
SCOTT SHAFER: Inside each of the
trees' cells, water gets pulled
up to the top as if it were

34:23.628 --> 34:28.566
being sucked up through a straw.
Researchers can determine how
much tension the water is

34:28.566 --> 34:32.404
under as it travels upward
and into each leaf.

34:32.404 --> 34:37.242
WENDY BAXTER: When we clip it,
the water retracts back into the
stem, kind of like a rubber

34:37.242 --> 34:39.377
band.

34:39.377 --> 34:43.848
SCOTT SHAFER: Researcher Ken
Schwab places the leaves in a
pressure chamber.

34:43.848 --> 34:49.454
WENDY BAXTER: When we put our
stem into the pressure chamber,
the amount of pressure that

34:49.454 --> 34:54.759
it takes to force the water back
out is an indication of how much
tension it was under.

34:54.759 --> 34:58.863
MAN: And I'm beginning to
see darkening and water.

34:58.863 --> 35:01.866
SCOTT SHAFER: The higher the
pressure required to push the
water out, the more stressed the

35:01.866 --> 35:04.235
tree is.

35:04.235 --> 35:09.808
MAN: The trees are definitely as
stressed as we have ever
measured giant sequoia. We

35:09.808 --> 35:15.513
have been measuring giant
sequoia water status
periodically over the last few
decades, under

35:15.513 --> 35:20.085
non-drought conditions, and most
of the trees seem to be kind of
at that level or exceeding

35:20.085 --> 35:22.420
it.

35:22.420 --> 35:27.726
SCOTT SHAFER: Trees move water
from soil to the atmosphere,
which helps create rain and

35:27.726 --> 35:33.698
snow. When little water is
available, the pull of the dry
atmosphere breaks the water

35:33.698 --> 35:39.270
column. Air in the water forms
bubbles, which prevent water
from moving up. If bubbles stop

35:39.270 --> 35:46.244
water flow in cell after
cell, the tree dies.

35:46.244 --> 35:50.382
Biologist Nathan Stephenson says
sequoias' main water source is
snow.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.851
NATHAN STEPHENSON, U.S.
Geological Survey: So the last
two winters here have been by

35:52.851 --> 35:55.920
far the warmest on record, and
what that's meant is there's
been almost no snow on the

35:55.920 --> 35:58.189
ground.

35:58.189 --> 36:03.395
SCOTT SHAFER: The weak snowpack
has led to new signs that the
giant trees are under stress.

36:03.395 --> 36:08.967
NATHAN STEPHENSON: I looked up,
and I saw a big, mature, giant
sequoia, and its foliage

36:08.967 --> 36:14.305
was turning brown. At least half
of its foliage had gone brown.
No one has ever reported that

36:14.305 --> 36:16.641
before.

36:16.641 --> 36:21.679
SCOTT SHAFER: While only a
handful of the park's sequoias
have recently perished, the

36:21.679 --> 36:25.116
Forest Service says the drought
is taking a toll on more than
six million trees of other

36:25.116 --> 36:28.520
species in the Sierra
Nevada Mountain Range.

36:28.520 --> 36:34.292
NATHAN STEPHENSON: We're seeing
firs, pines, incense cedars and
oaks are all dying at a

36:34.292 --> 36:38.530
rate we have never seen before.
Even during the 1977 drought in
California, we didn't

36:38.530 --> 36:42.367
see this many trees dying.

36:42.367 --> 36:48.673
SCOTT SHAFER: In Sequoia
National Park, Koren Nydick says
the giant trees are causing
concerns.

36:48.673 --> 36:53.278
KOREN NYDICK, Sequoia National
Park: A lot of our sequoias are
still appearing healthy,

36:53.278 --> 36:58.416
still doing well during the
drought. But there are some that
are showing symptoms, and we

36:58.416 --> 37:02.787
want to learn more about that
and be able to track that
stress.

37:02.787 --> 37:08.226
SCOTT SHAFER: To help
researchers study the effects of
the drought on the tens of
thousands

37:08.226 --> 37:13.998
of giant sequoias in the Sierra
Nevada, scientists aboard the
Carnegie Airborne Observatory
use

37:13.998 --> 37:19.337
instruments to measure trees'
water content. Blue trees are
getting the most water, followed

37:19.337 --> 37:25.477
by yellow, orange, and red
trees, which are getting the
least.

37:25.477 --> 37:30.582
The park has several options for
helping the most vulnerable
giant sequoias. Burning part

37:30.582 --> 37:34.519
of the forest would reduce the
number of overall trees, and
since sequoias are resistant to

37:34.519 --> 37:37.255
fire, more would survive.

37:37.255 --> 37:42.627
KOREN NYDICK: There's less
competition for the larger trees
that remain behind. So the

37:42.627 --> 37:46.197
larger trees have more access to
water and nutrients, and helps
them get through the

37:46.197 --> 37:48.666
drought.

37:48.666 --> 37:54.239
SCOTT SHAFER: If the trees'
health continued to deteriorate,
Nathan Stephenson of the
Geological

37:54.239 --> 38:00.278
Survey says humans may need to
intervene more directly and
provide trees with drip
irrigation.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.916
NATHAN STEPHENSON: If humans
continue to warm the climate by
adding greenhouse gases to

38:04.916 --> 38:08.219
it, we might have to consider
some unnatural actions.

38:08.219 --> 38:15.426
SCOTT SHAFER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Scott Shafer.

38:15.426 --> 38:27.705
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, we conclude
our series Congo's Hope with the
story of park ranger

38:27.705 --> 38:30.708
Emmanuel de Merode.

38:30.708 --> 38:35.580
"PBS NewsHour" contributing
editor Soledad O'Brien visited
the Congo's Virunga National

38:35.580 --> 38:40.084
Park, where she learned just how
dangerous and at times fatal it
can be to protect the

38:40.084 --> 38:43.388
park's gorillas.

38:43.388 --> 38:49.594
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Emmanuel de
Merode is an anthropologist, a
Belgian prince, and chief

38:49.594 --> 38:54.199
warden of the Virunga National
Park in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, one of the most

38:54.199 --> 38:59.003
fought-over national
parks on the planet.

38:59.003 --> 39:04.776
Once a draw for tourists, the
park's animals and resources
have been depleted by poachers

39:04.776 --> 39:13.851
and a civil war. The park's
story was chronicled in the
Oscar-nominated film "Virunga."
De

39:13.851 --> 39:21.593
Merode commands a force of 680
rangers. He's lost 140
protecting the park and survived

39:21.593 --> 39:25.096
an attempt on his own life.

39:25.096 --> 39:30.501
We spoke to him about the fight
to preserve the park and its
rare and special creatures.

39:30.501 --> 39:34.706
You're an anthropologist by
training. What made you want to
dedicate your life to the

39:34.706 --> 39:36.641
mountain gorillas?

39:36.641 --> 39:38.309
EMMANUEL DE MERODE, Director,
Virunga National Park: I'm very
attached to this country, to

39:38.309 --> 39:43.381
Congo. I came here 23 years ago
as a volunteer, as a researcher.

39:43.381 --> 39:47.719
It was the simple fact that
Congo some of the richest
wildlife, some of the most
spectacular

39:47.719 --> 39:49.754
natural landscapes in the world.

39:49.754 --> 39:52.924
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: How
big is the park?

39:52.924 --> 39:57.562
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: It stretches
on for 300 kilometers north.
It's a very big park. What's

39:57.562 --> 40:02.867
special about it is, it's
incredibly diverse, so there's
probably no park on Earth that

40:02.867 --> 40:09.307
has such an incredible range of
landscapes that go from the
summit of the Rwenzori
Mountains,

40:09.307 --> 40:13.578
which is right up in the north
of the park, and that goes up to
17,000 feet.

40:13.578 --> 40:18.883
So you have glaciers on the
equator. And then all the way
down to about 3,000 feet, and,

40:18.883 --> 40:22.487
in between, just the most
incredible range of utterly
different landscapes. And
because

40:22.487 --> 40:24.489
of that, you have got this
incredible range of species.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.157
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What
kind of species?

40:26.157 --> 40:29.694
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: So, we have
got the mountain gorillas that
we have here, lowland gorillas

40:29.694 --> 40:33.131
and chimpanzees, but also all
the Savannah species that are so
classically African, the

40:33.131 --> 40:37.702
elephants, the hippos, this
incredible assemblage.

40:37.702 --> 40:43.341
There's no park probably in the
world that has so many species
of mammals, reptiles,

40:43.341 --> 40:47.879
and birds as Virunga. That's
what makes it so special.
There's nowhere else in the
world

40:47.879 --> 40:52.550
that I would like to live. And
so it has everything for me.

40:52.550 --> 40:56.154
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Where are we
right now? This is the walls of
the orphanage.

40:56.154 --> 41:01.993
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: So this is
the Senkwekwe Center. And so
it's a sanctuary that we built

41:01.993 --> 41:09.000
a few years ago with the help of
Howard Buffett. It was built to
provide a home for the mountain

41:09.000 --> 41:14.639
gorillas that were rescued after
these terrible massacres that
happened in 2007.

41:14.639 --> 41:19.477
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And these
orphans, will they live in here
forever or do they go out into

41:19.477 --> 41:21.946
the bigger habitat
at some point?

41:21.946 --> 41:24.882
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: You know,
the ideal thing would be to
reintroduce them into their
natural

41:24.882 --> 41:30.154
habitat so that they can live a
complete life as wild gorillas.
But that may not be possible

41:30.154 --> 41:34.058
for all sorts of reasons. They
may find it impossible to adapt
back into the natural

41:34.058 --> 41:34.959
world.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.061
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What
can gorillas teach us?

41:37.061 --> 41:40.598
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Well,
there's an enormous amount, and
it's not just the science.

41:40.598 --> 41:46.204
They're the window, in a sense,
to relaunching a healthy economy
in this region thanks to

41:46.204 --> 41:50.508
the tourism industry that's
developing. But, in themselves,
they're absolutely wonderful

41:50.508 --> 41:54.579
animals. There's nothing quite
like mountain gorillas, because
they're so powerful. They're

41:54.579 --> 41:57.215
incredibly gentle by nature.

41:57.215 --> 42:03.388
Their whole ecology and their
whole social structure is very
family based. And they take

42:03.388 --> 42:08.893
on the very gentle side of
primate life in a sense. And so,
because of that, we were

42:08.893 --> 42:15.733
able to spend a lot of time with
them, because they welcome human
beings into their groups.

42:15.733 --> 42:20.705
And over the years, we have
developed a very rich
literature, a very rich
scientific knowledge

42:20.705 --> 42:25.376
on gorilla ecology, gorilla
social systems that actually
teach us a lot about ourselves.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.080
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: How close is
a gorilla to a human being?

42:29.080 --> 42:35.019
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: In terms of
their genetics, they're about 98
percent the same as we are.

42:35.019 --> 42:41.292
And so it's just an accident of
evolution that we are here and
that they are here. They,

42:41.292 --> 42:45.730
of course, tend to take the more
positive aspects of our
condition. And we tend to
sometimes

42:45.730 --> 42:49.233
be more destructive.

42:49.233 --> 42:54.939
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Is the story of
Virunga essentially a battle
over resources and -- and who
owns

42:54.939 --> 42:57.909
them and who -- who steals them?

42:57.909 --> 43:01.145
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: It's exactly
that. There've been four
catastrophic wars over the last

43:01.145 --> 43:04.215
20 years.

43:04.215 --> 43:08.853
Every single one of those wars
has started either in or
immediately around the national

43:08.853 --> 43:13.024
park. Those wars collectively
have -- have caused the death of
over six million people,

43:13.024 --> 43:17.161
so it's a very, very serious
issue, and it's all about access
to resources.

43:17.161 --> 43:19.931
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What would you
like people to know? I mean,
there will be a bunch of

43:19.931 --> 43:22.934
people who have followed the
conflict over the years and who
will be watching this.

43:22.934 --> 43:23.734
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Yes.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.503
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What would
you -- what's your message?

43:25.503 --> 43:28.873
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Well, what
we'd like is really to
demonstrate that it's not just
about

43:28.873 --> 43:33.544
a humanitarian crisis. There
actually is an incredibly
dynamic young population in
Congo

43:33.544 --> 43:37.081
that really wants to work, and
that really want to take hold of
-- you know, get control

43:37.081 --> 43:41.152
of their future by
rebuilding the industry.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.722
What that means for people
outside is that Congo is
actually a very, very
interesting

43:44.722 --> 43:47.258
place to invest in.

43:47.258 --> 43:50.061
Here, you can really get the
full picture of how it all
works.

43:50.061 --> 43:52.497
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Wow.

43:52.497 --> 43:57.635
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: This will
generate electricity for about
100 years. That's the lifespan
of

43:57.635 --> 44:03.307
this plant. It generates 13
megawatts, which is basically
three times what the whole city

44:03.307 --> 44:06.043
of Goma is getting
at the moment.

44:06.043 --> 44:11.315
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So, the whole
point of creating power is to
drive industry locally.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.351
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Yes.

44:13.351 --> 44:17.455
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: We saw a woman
putting bananas onto her truck,
or the boys carrying the
sugarcane.

44:17.455 --> 44:18.656
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Yes.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.025
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What happens?
What's the process now?

44:21.025 --> 44:24.428
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Well, that's
really the tragedy of Congo, is
that it's incredibly

44:24.428 --> 44:27.698
rich in resources, but
they're all being exported.

44:27.698 --> 44:34.105
All the money is lost in
transport, and none of it is
retained for the people of
Congo,

44:34.105 --> 44:38.142
and so really that's what we
need to turn around. To be able
to do it, the key is
electricity.

44:38.142 --> 44:41.979
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Could you
create an industry once you have
power that would process the

44:41.979 --> 44:45.883
sugarcane, or process the
bananas that these women are
hauling?

44:45.883 --> 44:49.887
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: So, when we
built our first hydroelectric
plant, it was a very small

44:49.887 --> 44:55.593
one, a few hundred kilometers
north from here. Before we'd
even finished the plant, some

44:55.593 --> 45:00.431
investors came and built a soap
factory, and that soap factory
now employs 400 people.

45:00.431 --> 45:06.137
It also has increased the income
for 10,000 farmers, producing
palm oil, and it's reduced

45:06.137 --> 45:08.973
the price of soap for about five
million Congolese consumers.

45:08.973 --> 45:12.009
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So a win for
the people, a win for the
workers.

45:12.009 --> 45:14.078
EMMANUEL DE MERODE:
Yes. It's been...

45:14.078 --> 45:19.550
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: All out of
one hydroelectric plant.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.154
You have had to put your own
life on the line as well.

45:23.154 --> 45:28.025
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: Yes, at
times, I think we all have,
those of us who work here.

45:28.025 --> 45:29.860
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Can you talk
about, as much as you would want
to, the incident where you

45:29.860 --> 45:31.996
were shot?

45:31.996 --> 45:34.298
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: There are
waves, there are periods of
violence, and one of those

45:34.298 --> 45:38.269
was last year.

45:38.269 --> 45:46.243
And I was driving back towards
the park. I happened to be alone
in the vehicle. So, with

45:46.243 --> 45:51.882
hindsight, that was probably a
mistake. As I was driving
through a forested park up the

45:51.882 --> 45:57.288
road, I saw in the distance a
man with a rifle. As I got
closer, he raised his rifle and
he

45:57.288 --> 46:00.391
opened fire on the vehicle.

46:00.391 --> 46:06.364
I realized I had to get away
from that situation as quickly
as I can. So I took the rifle
that

46:06.364 --> 46:10.401
I had with me in the car and got
out of the vehicle. And that
point, I got hit in the

46:10.401 --> 46:16.507
chest and through the stomach. I
was able to breathe and to get
into the forest. And

46:16.507 --> 46:21.545
then what I remember is a very
wonderful thing. There were two
farmers who came, and they

46:21.545 --> 46:25.182
had seen what happened. And they
came with a motorbike, and they
picked me up.

46:25.182 --> 46:29.854
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Did it ever
make you think, maybe I should
stop?

46:29.854 --> 46:35.593
EMMANUEL DE MERODE: No, I think
that's really a decision you
make when you start. You know,

46:35.593 --> 46:43.901
I have lost many of my staff;
140 of our rangers have died
since the war started, and 23
have

46:43.901 --> 46:46.937
died on my watch.

46:46.937 --> 46:55.980
They have died on the orders
that I gave. And so it would
never occur to me to stop.

46:55.980 --> 47:00.384
GWEN IFILL: Soledad will answer
your questions about her
reporting from the Democratic
Republic

47:00.384 --> 47:05.690
of Congo Friday at 1:00 p.m.
Eastern in our weekly "NewsHour"
Twitter chat. Send your

47:05.690 --> 47:16.067
thoughts and your questions
using #Congoshope or
#NewsHourChats.

47:16.067 --> 47:30.347
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
an eye for fashion in the
everyday.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.017
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

47:33.017 --> 47:41.525
JEFFREY BROWN: A casually
stylish woman on a SoHo, New
York, street, and Scott Schuman

47:41.525 --> 47:47.364
was there to grab the shot. It
was one of many photographs he
would take this day, examples

47:47.364 --> 47:52.970
of street style that Schuman
captures around the world, not
fashion trends or brands
exactly,

47:52.970 --> 47:56.006
but something more
individual and personal.

47:56.006 --> 47:58.008
SCOTT SCHUMAN, Photographer: I
bet if you stand right on the
edge a little bit, turn

47:58.008 --> 48:00.177
rights towards me.

48:00.177 --> 48:04.081
JEFFREY BROWN: Something Schuman
saw, for example, in this
blue-haired young man.

48:04.081 --> 48:07.284
SCOTT SCHUMAN: I think this was
the thing that first caught my
eye was this. Color is

48:07.284 --> 48:11.455
one thing, but there was
actually a lot of nice little
texture in the shirt, the hair,

48:11.455 --> 48:15.726
and, you know, there
was something sweet.

48:15.726 --> 48:19.997
At the end of the day, there was
just something sweet about him.
There was something that

48:19.997 --> 48:24.435
you thought you could capture. I
mean, look, the quality of the
expression on his face.

48:24.435 --> 48:29.473
JEFFREY BROWN: Later, a
photograph of the young man
showed up on The Sartorialist,
the

48:29.473 --> 48:33.844
blog Schuman launched 10 years
ago. It's become a go-to,
must-see site for millions
around

48:33.844 --> 48:37.782
the world, both in and out
of the fashion industry.

48:37.782 --> 48:44.088
Schumann, now 47, didn't pick up
a camera in a serious way until
he was a 31-year-old

48:44.088 --> 48:49.760
stay-at-home dad taking photos
of his kids at the park. He'd
worked in the fashion industry

48:49.760 --> 48:55.132
for many years. It was an
interest that started early, as
a teenager in the suburbs of
Indianapolis.

48:55.132 --> 48:59.937
SCOTT SCHUMAN: There was an
Armani ad of a guy in a suit,
and I thought, my dad doesn't

48:59.937 --> 49:03.274
look like that in a suit. When
my dad puts on a suit on, he
looks very stiff and very

49:03.274 --> 49:06.477
serious and this and that. I
mean, this guy looks totally
relaxed, and he looks like he

49:06.477 --> 49:08.646
could just go jump on the back
of a motorcycle in a his suit.

49:08.646 --> 49:11.248
JEFFREY BROWN: The Armani
ad did it for you, huh?

49:11.248 --> 49:14.318
SCOTT SCHUMAN: It totally did.
It totally opened my eyes in a
way that I just thought

49:14.318 --> 49:21.192
I didn't know people lived this
way. And so in that same kind of
romantic way that I fell

49:21.192 --> 49:24.461
in love with fashion when I was
15 is still the way that I like
to shoot.

49:24.461 --> 49:27.765
JEFFREY BROWN: The clothes
telling you something about who
they might be, and clothes as
sort

49:27.765 --> 49:30.601
of an identity?

49:30.601 --> 49:34.471
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Kind of, you
know, like a costume. I think,
the more I do it, the more I
realize

49:34.471 --> 49:39.910
that, to, me it's also more like
a costume, like how a director
would have costumes in

49:39.910 --> 49:44.014
a movie, and how the clothes
kind of -- because I never
assume that that's who they
really

49:44.014 --> 49:48.652
are, right, or that they can
really tell you anything about
that person.

49:48.652 --> 49:55.960
But it helps you imagine who
they might be or -- I don't
consider myself a
photojournalist.

49:55.960 --> 49:59.063
Mine are really just my kind of
take on who that person is, and
how the clothes kind of

49:59.063 --> 50:05.002
help create the image.

50:05.002 --> 50:09.106
JEFFREY BROWN: But the photos
are just a starting point for
the real action, Schuman says,
which

50:09.106 --> 50:12.343
is found in the give-and-take
from his audience around the
world.

50:12.343 --> 50:15.279
SCOTT SCHUMAN: When I started, I
was listening to a lot of sports
talk radio.

50:15.279 --> 50:17.281
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

50:17.281 --> 50:20.084
SCOTT SCHUMAN: And people, you
know, they talk about sports and
their kind of point

50:20.084 --> 50:23.120
of view, People will call in and
they really have a discussion,
and somehow it clicked

50:23.120 --> 50:26.590
in my mind that you could do
something similar like that in
fashion.

50:26.590 --> 50:31.395
I could go out and take pictures
of people on the street, put it
on the blog, and then

50:31.395 --> 50:34.331
people could have their
comments. You know, I love the
way that looks, or that looks
horrible,

50:34.331 --> 50:37.534
or who is this person?

50:37.534 --> 50:42.473
So, I never worry about if I'm
telling the story of who this
person really is. It's totally

50:42.473 --> 50:44.241
my perception, how
they make me dream.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.176
JEFFREY BROWN: It's your story.

50:46.176 --> 50:49.280
SCOTT SCHUMAN: It's my
perception of this picture. It's
my picture. But then when you

50:49.280 --> 50:52.149
share it on the Internet, then
everybody gets to have their
take on what their story is

50:52.149 --> 50:54.385
on it.

50:54.385 --> 50:59.490
JEFFREY BROWN: This was Fashion
Week in New York. And for part
of the day, Schuman joined

50:59.490 --> 51:04.428
the scrum of photographers
snapping photos outside a
Lacoste show, and then had a
front-row

51:04.428 --> 51:08.599
seat for the runway action.

51:08.599 --> 51:13.203
Most days, though, he does this,
rides his bike around New York
and other cities looking

51:13.203 --> 51:19.310
for subjects. Nice work if you
can make it work, which Schuman
does through ads on the

51:19.310 --> 51:24.481
blog and through collaborations
with designers. He's a
self-described shy guy stopping
total

51:24.481 --> 51:27.117
strangers on the street.

51:27.117 --> 51:30.921
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Good, good, good,
good. You can put your hands in
your pocket.

51:30.921 --> 51:37.428
I think that shyness makes me
very understanding of other
people. I can put myself in
their

51:37.428 --> 51:41.198
position, the way that I have to
approach a straight guy, and
walk up to some straight

51:41.198 --> 51:42.499
guy on the street and say, hey,
you look great, can I take your
picture?

51:42.499 --> 51:44.234
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

51:44.234 --> 51:46.704
SCOTT SCHUMAN: And make him feel
that I'm not trying to hit on
him. And same thing,

51:46.704 --> 51:51.241
like if I walk up to a girl who
looks really cool and say, oh,
you look really great, can

51:51.241 --> 51:53.744
I take your picture, I have to
make sure she understands I am
not trying to hit on her.

51:53.744 --> 51:56.313
JEFFREY BROWN: These are the
challenges of your trade, eh?

51:56.313 --> 52:00.417
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Totally the
challenges, and totally -- it
comes from being sensitive to

52:00.417 --> 52:02.987
myself, to try and put
myself in their position.

52:02.987 --> 52:08.492
JEFFREY BROWN: The blog led to
books. A new one coming this
fall is titled "The
Sartorialist:

52:08.492 --> 52:15.432
X," featuring street style
around the world, Italian men
smoking outside a trattoria, a

52:15.432 --> 52:22.072
mother at an outdoor market in
Peru, a young man on a moped in
Bali, and much more.

52:22.072 --> 52:28.345
Is there such a thing as a
global style? Are you seeing a
global style or a diversity
around...

52:28.345 --> 52:31.181
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Oh, it's a
total, total diversity.

52:31.181 --> 52:37.688
A great example is, I was in
Soweto in South Africa, and
there was a young guy there, and

52:37.688 --> 52:41.625
he had on a suit that he bought
at a secondhand store. When I
shot him -- and he's in the

52:41.625 --> 52:45.629
third book -- pulled back far
enough that you get the context
of who he is, the way

52:45.629 --> 52:48.565
he's dressed, and the
place where he lives.

52:48.565 --> 52:54.605
And to me, that's what really
makes the photograph so
endearing, is that you have got
this kid

52:54.605 --> 52:57.875
who felt -- talking to him, I
felt like I was talking to
myself. He was another
15-year-old

52:57.875 --> 53:02.980
me. He had a dream of the
outside world, and was trying to
figure out how to fit into that

53:02.980 --> 53:06.750
outside world while he
still lived in his place.

53:06.750 --> 53:09.420
First of all, they're nice
portraits. Hopefully, they're
beautiful portraits. Hopefully,
it's

53:09.420 --> 53:13.357
a nice portrait of a person.

53:13.357 --> 53:17.027
JEFFREY BROWN: And on our walk
through SoHo, Schuman was ever
on the lookout for the next

53:17.027 --> 53:21.098
bit of style to catch his eye.

53:21.098 --> 53:25.602
From the streets of downtown
Manhattan, I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

53:25.602 --> 53:42.553
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Medicare's annual open
enrollment begins tomorrow, and

53:42.553 --> 53:47.758
so we kick off a series with our
benefits expert, Phil Moeller,
who breaks down everything

53:47.758 --> 53:51.795
you need to know to get started.
For the next few weeks, his Ask
Phil column will also answer

53:51.795 --> 53:54.798
your questions.

53:54.798 --> 53:59.970
You can read Phil's guide and
find out how to leave your
question on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:59.970 --> 54:06.677
GWEN IFILL: Tune in later
tonight on "Charlie Rose": The
New York Times' Maggie Haberman

54:06.677 --> 54:10.314
and Clinton adviser Roger Altman
analyze the Democratic
presidential debate and the
outlook

54:10.314 --> 54:12.583
for the candidates.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.318
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:14.318 --> 54:15.319
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:15.319 --> 54:18.489
And we're glad to have you back.

54:18.489 --> 54:21.024
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

54:21.024 --> 54:21.558
you, and good night.
