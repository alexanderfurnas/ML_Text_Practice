00:05.339 --> 00:07.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
deep dive into
the fight to replace the
Affordable Care Act

00:11.278 --> 00:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- what the Republicans health
care could
mean for millions of Americans.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday:

00:19.286 --> 00:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense:
This has been seriously damaging
to the CIA

00:24.258 --> 00:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and its ability to conduct
intelligence operations.

00:27.361 --> 00:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We sit down with
former CIA
Director Leon Panetta to talk
about the WikiLeaks

00:33.033 --> 00:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documents and what it says about
the nation's
top intelligence agency.

00:37.971 --> 00:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Miles O'Brien takes us to
Antarctica,
where a growing crack threatens
to create

00:44.011 --> 00:46.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the largest icebergs in
history.

00:46.446 --> 00:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT, University of
Maryland: What
we're talking about is a calving
of an iceberg

00:50.350 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's a size of a state.

00:52.052 --> 00:56.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get that, you really need a
satellite to
be able to see all of it in one
shot.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.793 --> 01:04.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.064 --> 01:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
bill to replace
Obamacare has officially begun
its journey

01:17.010 --> 01:19.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through Congress today.

01:19.112 --> 01:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican leaders and the White
House are
pushing it, against opposition,
not only from

01:23.884 --> 01:28.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, but also conservative
critics and
powerful interest groups.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports on the
day's events.

House: This
is a good day.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: House Speaker
Paul Ryan was
soaringly optimistic this
morning, defending

01:36.897 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the GOP health care plan that
some conservatives
have called it Obamacare lite.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: This is what good
conservative
health care reform looks like.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is bold and it is long
overdue.

01:49.176 --> 01:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is us fulfilling our
promises.

01:53.046 --> 01:59.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This as two
committees started
slogging through the bill
section by section,

02:00.020 --> 02:03.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Democrats and Republicans
fought over procedure
and amendments.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Excuse me.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you would suspend, we're
going to move
to forward with the regular
order.

02:07.661 --> 02:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: If you knew
where to look,
you could see in the audience
signs of the

02:11.932 --> 02:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
larger battle fully under way.

02:14.201 --> 02:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Energy and Commerce
Committee, we saw
representatives of doctors
groups, like this

02:18.472 --> 02:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman from the American Academy
of Family
Physicians, and of hospitals,
like this lawyer

02:23.710 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whose firm represents several,
also biotech
interests, including this man
from well-known

02:29.883 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
company, Genentech.

02:32.152 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats like Raul Ruiz, a
doctor himself,
are highlighting some of those
groups' reactions.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAUL RUIZ (D), California: The
American Medical
Association came out strongly
against this

02:41.228 --> 02:43.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill this morning.

02:43.163 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, they represent --
they are the
largest organized group that
represents physicians

02:48.602 --> 02:50.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the s United States.

02:50.437 --> 02:54.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The AMA
specifically said
the bill would -- quote --
"result in millions

02:54.408 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Americans losing coverage and
benefits."

02:57.310 --> 03:03.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another major group, the AARP,
also is opposed,
saying the plan would
dramatically increase

03:03.183 --> 03:06.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
costs for people between the
ages of 50 and
64.

03:06.653 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
praised the
plan, calling it absolutely
critical in restoring

03:12.492 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care markets.

03:15.429 --> 03:20.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House, Press
Secretary Sean Spicer
read his own list of supportive
groups, and

03:20.467 --> 03:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then dismissed the list of
doctors and other
organizations opposed so far.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
This isn't about trying to
figure out how

03:27.207 --> 03:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many special interests in
Washington we can
get paid off.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about making sure that
patients get the
best deal.

03:33.346 --> 03:37.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime,
multiple analysts
have concluded the GOP bill will
leave millions

03:37.584 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more without health coverage.

03:39.886 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer responded to that by
questioning a
main arbiter, the nonpartisan
Congressional

03:44.191 --> 03:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget Office, which has not yet
released
its estimate.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: If you're looking
at the CBO
for accuracy, you're looking in
the wrong

03:50.097 --> 03:51.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

03:52.032 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were way, way off last
time, in every
aspect of how they scored and
projected Obamacare.

03:56.870 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Spicer said the
White House
will begin a full-court press on
the bill.

04:01.174 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That started late this afternoon
as President
Trump met with conservatives.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans in Congress are
aware that they
have critics on the left and
within their

04:09.316 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own camp on the right, but they
are not yet
showing any sweat.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.354 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:14.387 --> 04:18.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R),
Washington: This
is just the beginning of the
process, and

04:18.358 --> 04:20.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is the way legislating
takes place.

04:20.127 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a
tedious, but important
week.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House committees may take until
Friday to
work through the bill.

04:26.967 --> 04:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility.

04:44.017 --> 04:49.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Footage from the scene showed
Afghan soldiers
rushing to the complex as
helicopters landed

04:49.556 --> 04:52.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the roof to rescue trapped
victims.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The fighting lasted for hours.

accused Russia
today of deploying a land-based

the spirit and intent of a 1987
agreement,

05:21.054 --> 05:23.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a bid to pressure the U.S.

PAUL SELVA, Vice Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of
Staff: The system itself
presents a risk to

05:27.160 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of our facilities in
Europe, and we believe
that the Russians have
deliberately deployed

05:32.365 --> 05:38.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it in order to pose a threat to
NATO and to
facilities within the NATO area
of responsibility.

05:38.438 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

previously accused Russia of
breaking the

05:43.810 --> 05:44.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
treaty.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Kremlin has rejected the
U.S. complaints.

05:47.614 --> 05:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was International Women's

stay off the
job and protest for pay equity

a ban on funding international
groups that
offer abortions.

06:01.861 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a follow-up to the mass

President Trump took office.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Police said some of the teens
set fires to
protest overcrowding.

06:39.633 --> 06:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the aftermath, relatives

They haven't given us an
explanation, and
they don't let us go in.

07:00.720 --> 07:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The facility has

ideal.

they love,

07:59.179 --> 08:04.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regardless of where they come
from, is a part
of this Los Angeles dream and
always will

08:04.117 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be as long as I am your mayor.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Under Garcetti,

the city's

08:10.924 --> 08:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poverty and homeless rates
remain high, and
violent crime has risen for
three years running.

08:17.630 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI Director James Comey served
notice today
that he means to finish out his
10-year term.

08:23.737 --> 08:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Boston speech, he joked,
"You're stuck
with me for about another
six-and-a-half years."

08:29.008 --> 08:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey became a lightning rod
over his handling
of the Hillary Clinton e-mail
investigation

08:33.780 --> 08:35.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

08:35.782 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last weekend, he urged the
Justice Department
to reject President Trump's
claim that President

08:40.754 --> 08:43.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama tapped his phones.

08:43.590 --> 08:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China has approved 38 new
trademarks for the
Trump family company.

08:48.695 --> 08:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement today covers an
array of
potential enterprises, from
hotels, to golf

08:54.267 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clubs, to a class of businesses
that includes
escort services.

08:58.772 --> 09:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump Organization lawyers
applied for the
Trump trademarks last April.

09:03.042 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China also reports that it ran a
trade deficit
last month, for the first time
in three years.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could signal improving
economic growth.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Wall Street mostly
gave ground
today.

09:14.754 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 69 points
to close at 20855.

09:20.894 --> 09:25.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose three points,
and the S&amp;P
500 dropped five.

09:25.932 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a former
CIA director on what the
WikiLeaks documents

09:30.570 --> 09:37.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean for the agency; women show
their economic
strength by striking across the
nation; how

09:37.177 --> 09:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a growing Antarctic rift could
create one
of the biggest icebergs in
history; and much

09:48.288 --> 09:50.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

09:50.490 --> 09:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday's
WikiLeaks dump
of documents was yet another
major breach

09:59.098 --> 10:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of classified information inside
U.S. intelligence
services.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan picks up our
story.

10:05.738 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, the
story about intelligence
leaks advanced on multiple
fronts.

10:10.210 --> 10:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reuters reported intelligence
officials have
known about the security breach
since last

10:15.114 --> 10:19.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
year, and are focused on
contractors as the
likeliest source of the leak.

10:19.519 --> 10:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And White House Press Secretary
Sean Spicer
said President Trump is
extremely concerned

10:23.256 --> 10:24.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the breach.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on all of this, we turn
to Leon Panetta.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as the CIA director
during the Obama
administration.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Panetta, first, what's
happening in the
CIA right now?

10:33.333 --> 10:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's a mole, how do they find
him, if it's
an inside job, him or her?

10:37.370 --> 10:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or, if it's from the outside,
how do we figure
out where we were hacked?

10:41.007 --> 10:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense:
Well, I think the more important
issue is

10:45.378 --> 10:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be, how do you replace
those important
tools that have now been made
public and try

10:57.657 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reestablish our intelligence
capability,
so we can gather the information
that is absolutely

11:05.965 --> 11:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
essential in order to protect
our country?

11:09.335 --> 11:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been seriously damaging
to the CIA
and its ability to conduct
intelligence operations.

11:17.677 --> 11:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would imagine the first
focus is on,
what do we do to try to replace
our ability

11:24.250 --> 11:25.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go after terrorists?

11:25.652 --> 11:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know, we
had Chelsea
Manning from the Army.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had Edward Snowden and Harold
Martin from
the NSA.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Weren't there reforms taken
after these things?

11:35.161 --> 11:36.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why didn't they work?

11:36.896 --> 11:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: You know, I'm sure
there were
steps taken to try to make sure
that this

11:42.835 --> 11:44.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wouldn't happen.

11:44.537 --> 11:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we are, clearly, living in a
world in
which the ability to hack has
developed to

11:52.078 --> 11:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a point where I happen to think
that probably
anything is vulnerable today.

11:59.919 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think you try to take steps
to try to
protect that kind of sensitive
information,

12:07.327 --> 12:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to do what you can to make
sure that those
who are working for you are
taking steps to

12:12.532 --> 12:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protect it, contractors are
taking steps to
protect it.

12:16.703 --> 12:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bottom line is that, in
today's world,
I think you always have to be
prepared that

12:22.442 --> 12:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody may very well be able
to get access
to that kind of information and,
if they do,

12:28.948 --> 12:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they will make it public.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's the world we live
in right
now.

12:32.785 --> 12:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know, I
think it caught
a lot of people by surprise that
the CIA has

12:37.123 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such an extensive hacking
operation.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Don't we have the NSA for that?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is the CIA doing this?

12:42.795 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, the CIA does
it for intelligence-gathering
purposes abroad.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not done here in the United
States.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's done abroad.

12:53.172 --> 12:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for that reason, the CIA
has to develop
the capabilities that it has
developed in

12:59.979 --> 13:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order to be able to track those
that are known
suspects of terrorism.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, we went through 9/11.

13:09.489 --> 13:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a national commission
that was established
to find out why we were attacked
on 9/11.

13:16.462 --> 13:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the result of that is that
the CIA and
other intelligence agencies
developed better

13:22.001 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
capabilities to go after
terrorists and to
try to locate them.

13:25.905 --> 13:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a reason we have not
had another
9/11 attack in this country, and
a lot of

13:31.611 --> 13:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is because our intelligence
agencies,
our law enforcement agencies are
sharing information

13:37.350 --> 13:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and gathering information that
makes sure
we protect the United States.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
sharing information,
back in 2010, when you were
still CIA director,

13:45.124 --> 13:50.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration said
that they would
share zero day vulnerabilities,
those hacks

13:50.296 --> 13:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are core in pieces of
software, like
in an Apple iPhone or an Android
operating

13:57.270 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, with the technology
companies.

13:59.105 --> 14:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, here, we have evidence that
the CIA has
hoarded a lot of those zero day
vulnerabilities

14:04.277 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and really violated that trust.

14:07.046 --> 14:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, I have to
tell you, at
least in my time as director of
the CIA, that

14:14.187 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we had a very good relationship
with Silicon
Valley and with high-tech
companies.

14:20.093 --> 14:24.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, you know, we had a
cooperative relationship.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, they have their
interests, and
we respect that.

14:27.633 --> 14:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are dealing with privacy
issues, and
we respect that as well.

14:32.371 --> 14:38.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, all of us are
concerned about
being able to ensure that we are
able to go

14:38.711 --> 14:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after terrorists, that we're
able to detect
when they are planning attacks
on this country

14:46.119 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and elsewhere, and that we are
able to take
steps to protect this country.

14:51.324 --> 14:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we have to do
is make sure
that we get back to that kind of
cooperative

14:57.196 --> 14:58.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relationship.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The thing that
has a lot
of people concerned is, when you
keep these

15:00.800 --> 15:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zero day vulnerabilities to
yourself, and
you don't tell Apple or you
don't tell Google

15:04.270 --> 15:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or you don't tell Microsoft,
hey, there's
this hole in your software, that
means that

15:07.840 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
identity thieves, other
governments could
also be using this.

15:11.477 --> 15:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's also general
discomfort, to
put it mildly, with consumers,
who say, wait

15:16.115 --> 15:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a minute, I thought that my
product was safe,
but here I don't necessarily
know whether

15:23.422 --> 15:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's even -- my government's
look out for
my best interests.

15:26.526 --> 15:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, again, I
think the fundamental
issue that's involved here is
whether or not

15:35.768 --> 15:41.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we want our intelligence
agencies and our
law enforcement agencies to be
able to protect

15:41.574 --> 15:43.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

15:43.442 --> 15:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that there are
there's often this
debate about, are we going to be
able to protect

15:48.214 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our security and our freedoms at
the same
time?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I believe we can.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think we have to make a
choice on
that.

15:54.787 --> 16:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is that what the CIA
has done
in terms of its capabilities and
what it is

16:02.361 --> 16:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to do is done pursuant to
the law and
is done pursuant to oversight by
the Congress

16:09.168 --> 16:11.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and by the Intelligence
Committees on the
hill.

16:11.938 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are fully aware of what
capabilities
the CIA has, and that is the way
we try to

16:18.978 --> 16:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protect our freedoms at the same
time.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Former Defense
Secretary
and former head of the CIA,
among many other

16:24.951 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, Leon Panetta, thanks so
much for joining
us.

16:28.588 --> 16:36.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEON PANETTA: Thank you.

16:36.629 --> 16:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least 13
protesters were
arrested in New York City today,
as strikes

16:45.137 --> 16:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and rallies unfolded across the
globe in the
name of women.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
International Women's Day became
A Day Without
Women in some American cities.

16:57.950 --> 17:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands stayed away from work
and took to
the streets partly to
demonstrate contributions

17:03.856 --> 17:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that women make to the economy.

17:05.524 --> 17:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NELINI STAMP, Protester: There
is a massive
resistance movement that is
growing.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are a part of it.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we need to put our bodies on
our line.

17:14.100 --> 17:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Washington, a
march to the
White House targeted a
reinstatement of the

17:21.474 --> 17:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so-called global gag rule.

17:23.943 --> 17:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It denies foreign aid to groups
that provide
abortions or related services.

17:28.614 --> 17:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERRA SIPPEL, President, CHANGE:
This is about
denying health providers from
providing health

17:33.452 --> 17:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care, just information about
women's options
and choices.

17:37.623 --> 17:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Overall, the
marches were smaller
than the one million or so who
turned out

17:43.562 --> 17:49.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after President Trump's
inauguration, but
leading women in Congress
appeared outside

17:49.502 --> 17:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Capitol dressed in red, the
color associated
with the labor movement and
today's strike.

17:56.342 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California Democrat Barbara Lee
pushed back
against criticism that only
privileged women

18:02.481 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could afford to stay home.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA LEE (D), California: We
also recognize
that there are millions of women
are unable

18:09.188 --> 18:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to walk out because they might
get fired or
cannot afford to lose their
meager incomes.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we walked out for them, too.

18:16.562 --> 18:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Teachers at the
Washington
rally said much the same, as the
strike forced

18:21.500 --> 18:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some school systems to close,
leaving families
to find last-minute child care.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLI WRIGHT, Teacher: There's
power in numbers.

18:28.708 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I happen to work for a
school district
that had to close because we all
took leave.

18:35.514 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we just keep fighting for
stuff like
this and we stand our ground,
then change

18:41.721 --> 18:43.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can come.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, another
crowd rallied
at the Department of Labor,
calling for pay

18:46.759 --> 18:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equity and other rights, at a
time when American
women earn 80 cents for every
dollar a man

18:53.766 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
makes.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump tweeted a
general statement
of support this morning.

18:58.270 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I have tremendous respect for
women," he
said, "and the many roles they
serve that

19:03.876 --> 19:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are vital to the fabric of our
society and
our economy."

19:07.680 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And first lady Melania Trump and
the president's
daughter Ivanka hosted a small
White House

19:13.919 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
luncheon in honor of the day.

19:16.789 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, protests played out
internationally,
from Mexico City, to Istanbul,
Turkey.

19:23.662 --> 19:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the women's movement
and what
today's events represent, we
turn to Farida

19:28.634 --> 19:30.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jalalzai.

19:30.403 --> 19:35.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's author of the book
"Shattered, Cracked
and Firmly Intact: Women and the
Executive

19:35.141 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Glass Ceiling Worldwide."

19:36.942 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She teaches political science at
Oklahoma
State University.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Rebecca Traister,
writer-at-large for
"New York" magazine and author
of the book

19:45.651 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"All the Single ladies:
Unmarried Women and
the Rise of An Independent
Nation."

19:51.690 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Farida Jalalzai.

19:55.461 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think today's
protests marches
say about the state of the
women's movement

20:01.100 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this country right now?

20:03.002 --> 20:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARIDA JALALZAI, Oklahoma State
University:
I think it states that it's
essentially strong.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's burgeoning.

20:08.207 --> 20:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a moment that women
have seized
on to say, we're not going to
just stop the

20:14.780 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
post-inauguration activities.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're here.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're trying to build on
momentum, and we're
trying to bring to the floor
lots of different

20:22.021 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues that are about women's
empowerment.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in many ways, it's larger
than that.

20:27.259 --> 20:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm very optimistic, from
what I have
actually seen as an academic,
thinking that

20:31.931 --> 20:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it could have just been a point
that fizzled.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm seeing that there's this
building
of strength and just even
conversations that

20:38.671 --> 20:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're having today that we
wouldn't have had
a year ago, actually.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm very surprised, and
pleasantly so.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rebecca Traister,
you're nodding
your head.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is it about today?

20:49.715 --> 20:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there were marches in
some places,
not everywhere.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What did it say?

20:54.453 --> 20:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

20:56.255 --> 20:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": Well, I
think -- I think
it says that the kind of mass
reaction and

20:59.225 --> 21:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mass resistance that we saw in
such huge numbers
in January is -- it remains,
that women are

21:06.765 --> 21:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engaged politically, that
they're interested
in working together.

21:09.935 --> 21:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Farida said, it's not --
these are not
issues we're seeing anymore in
the way that

21:14.640 --> 21:17.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have historically, as
compartmentalized,
as just about reproductive
rights.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You had a reproductive rights
demonstration.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You had a wage demonstration.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is in concert with women
who have been
striking around the world.

21:25.117 --> 21:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is an international --
there is history
of this strike and this movement
around the

21:30.156 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the United States
working in solidarity
with women globally, which is
new on this

21:35.027 --> 21:36.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scale.

21:36.962 --> 21:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what you're seeing
is women in
huge numbers participating in
political resistance

21:41.467 --> 21:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and raising their voices in ways
that we have
not seen in decades in this
country.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it wasn't a one-off in
January.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You see another mass uprising
today.

21:50.943 --> 21:57.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Farida Jalalzai,
what percentage of American
women are represented

21:57.316 --> 21:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by something like what happened
today?

21:58.751 --> 22:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know not every woman's views
are represented
here.

22:03.622 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARIDA JALALZAI: Well, you're
not going to
represent everybody's views, but
I don't think

22:07.927 --> 22:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the conversation has been
limiting at
all in terms of being more
broad.

22:12.932 --> 22:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I think it's just been
the opposite,
where, when you look at the
leadership, say,

22:18.037 --> 22:25.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, of the women's
march in D.C.,
this was led by and it spoke to
lots of diverse

22:25.311 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

22:27.213 --> 22:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we can't capture all
women, you know,
that's something that it can't
be disappointing,

22:31.850 --> 22:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there's no way that we
could capture
every single heart and mind of
every single

22:37.122 --> 22:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman, but that it's, I think,
more broad
than what we would maybe expect
it to be,

22:43.629 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe limited to maybe white,
privileged,
upper-class women.

22:47.466 --> 22:49.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The discussion and I think the
representation
has actually been much broader.

22:52.671 --> 22:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in many respects, it's
because the demands
have been there for it to be
broad.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rebecca Traister,
how much
room is there in the women's
movement for

23:00.913 --> 23:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate and discussion around
questions like
pay equity, equal rights for
women, and all

23:08.187 --> 23:10.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its interpretations?

23:10.089 --> 23:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: Well, the
women's movement
itself has always been, by
definition, cacophonous,

23:13.959 --> 23:14.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full of dissent.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been motivated by dissent.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In part, that's because it's a
majority movement.

23:18.631 --> 23:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk about women's
liberation or
women's equality, you're talking
about the

23:23.836 --> 23:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liberation and equality of more
than half
of our population.

23:26.905 --> 23:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you try to organize
around a majority,
what you get is an enormous
array of perspectives,

23:36.081 --> 23:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experiences, races, classes,
economic positions.

23:39.318 --> 23:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, if you're going
to try to
work on a movement that extends
to represent

23:45.791 --> 23:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all those different positions
and perspectives,
it's going to be full of
dissent, and differ

23:48.894 --> 23:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people thinking that we should
operate in
different ways.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a sign that the movement
is healthy.

23:54.266 --> 23:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it is -- the fact
that there is
dissent within those -- amongst
the people

24:00.005 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are participating is a sign
that people
are engaged and feel passionate
about taking

24:04.610 --> 24:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hand in what direction we're
going to go.

24:06.478 --> 24:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that women oppose it as
well, you
know, that there are
conservative women, we

24:12.318 --> 24:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't have had patriarchal
power structures
if there weren't women there to
support it.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's nothing new.

24:17.589 --> 24:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are always going to be
women who in
some way disagree about the
direction that

24:22.328 --> 24:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women's rights should go.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Farida Jalalzai,
both of you
are suggesting the women's
movement of today

24:27.533 --> 24:33.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a movement that has evolved
since the '60s
and the -- 1960s and 1970s.

24:33.706 --> 24:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you measure success for
the kinds of
statements these women today are
making?

24:39.378 --> 24:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARIDA JALALZAI: That's a really
difficult
question to answer, but I will
give it my

24:44.249 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best shot.

24:46.151 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Measuring success, sustained
activity, asking,
claiming different aspects of
representation

24:50.689 --> 24:54.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be represented fully.

24:54.093 --> 24:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of it is raising a
lot of these
policy areas and being broad,
and not just

24:59.698 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
focusing on even women's
empowerment, but
how do you empower marginalized
groups?

25:04.703 --> 25:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of it does have to, I
think, in some
ways, be linked to the political
elites.

25:10.042 --> 25:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, there's a lot to be
gained from
mass movements.

25:14.813 --> 25:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would like that to also be
in accordance
with more women actually running
and attempting

25:20.853 --> 25:22.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be the lawmakers.

25:22.688 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have this belief that,
when you have
women towards maybe the bottom
end as citizens

25:30.195 --> 25:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are articulating demands,
that I also
want to see greater
representation of women

25:34.566 --> 25:38.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
within political -- the
political realm as
policy-makers.

25:38.203 --> 25:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, that's the success,
the sustained
conversation, the policies that
are ultimately

25:44.276 --> 25:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposed and hopefully passed,
and also the
ways that we can say the
diversity amongst

25:50.082 --> 25:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public officials has broadened,
to include
people of different genders and
races.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rebecca Traister, what about
that?

25:57.623 --> 26:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you measure -- clearly,
part of this
is getting more women elected
with these views,

26:00.359 --> 26:02.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but what more?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: More women
elected, more
women running, even if they
don't -- more

26:04.897 --> 26:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women participating in the
process.

26:06.665 --> 26:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other half of that,
which we have
seen in an unprecedented way --
not in my

26:09.435 --> 26:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
memory have I ever seen so many
people participating
in the act of political
resistance, not just

26:14.706 --> 26:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the demonstrations, but the
calling and writing
their representatives, finding
out about policy

26:20.179 --> 26:22.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and legislation.

26:22.047 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never seen so many
people, women and
men, as politically engaged as
they have been.

26:25.851 --> 26:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we can see some of the
fruits of that
being brought to bear.

26:30.189 --> 26:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see public officials being
hesitant on
health care reform, you know, on
repealing

26:37.796 --> 26:39.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

26:39.631 --> 26:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A month ago, I would have sat
here and told
you that's going to be the first
-- they have

26:41.033 --> 26:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been promising they're going to
repeal it.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a bad idea.

26:44.703 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The numbers of people who are
calling their
representatives and saying,
don't do this,

26:48.040 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are holding town halls, and
that is being
enabled by the mass women's
movement, because

26:52.845 --> 26:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the success of the marches and
protests like
this are making people feel
like, wait, I

26:56.748 --> 27:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to be a part of this
movement that resists
this power structure.

27:00.586 --> 27:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we see a
lot of energy
around what's going on today.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: That's the
crucial thing.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And today is just
a snapshot.

27:06.091 --> 27:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something we're going to
continue to
watch.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rebecca Traister, Farida
Jalalzai, thank you
both.

27:09.061 --> 27:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FARIDA JALALZAI: Thank you.

27:18.637 --> 27:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:25.644 --> 27:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
closer look
at the details of the Republican
plan to replace

27:30.449 --> 27:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act; and a
new exhibit
explores America's enduring
fascination with

27:36.221 --> 27:38.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poet Emily Dickinson.

27:38.156 --> 27:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: There's a giant crack
in an ice
shelf of the Antarctic that's
been the source

27:44.596 --> 27:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of much attention this winter,
and is raising
new concerns over the larger
stability of

27:50.102 --> 27:51.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the ice there.

27:51.570 --> 27:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story, the
focus of
this week's Leading Edge.

27:56.174 --> 28:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If glaciology is
all that it
is cracked up to be, this long,
fast-growing

28:02.347 --> 28:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rift in the Antarctic ice is a
huge iceberg
in the making, one of the
largest ever seen,

28:09.087 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the size of Delaware.

28:11.623 --> 28:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome to the Larsen Sea Ice
Shelf, teetering
on the edge of breaking away
from the glacier.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have known about this for
quite a while,
right?

28:19.197 --> 28:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT, University of
Maryland: We have
certainly known about the bulk
of this rift

28:22.467 --> 28:23.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a while.

28:23.669 --> 28:26.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's this accelerated
propagation that's really
new.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's moving fast.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Moving fast.

28:29.241 --> 28:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kelly Brunt is a
glaciologist
at the University of Maryland
and NASA's Goddard

28:33.579 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Space Flight Center.

28:35.681 --> 28:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She used a wall of monitors
there to show
me the growing rift, fueled in
part by rising

28:40.886 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air and sea temperatures.

28:43.555 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the glaciers in West
Antarctica all dropped
into the water, global sea level
would rise

28:48.760 --> 28:51.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by more than 15 feet.

28:51.463 --> 28:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brunt showed me the big picture,
a composite
of images from several
satellites.

28:57.102 --> 28:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is how the glacier ice
flows here.

28:59.638 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Ice flows from the
center of
the continent out to the edges,
much like

29:04.910 --> 29:07.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
syrup on the center of your
pancake flowing
towards the edges.

29:07.446 --> 29:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see there are areas
where it's
moving pretty slowly, and then
there are areas

29:11.783 --> 29:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's moving very quickly.

29:14.152 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those quick places are
generally in our
areas of ice shelves.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, when we think
about ice,
we think about something static.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not static, is it?

29:22.494 --> 29:23.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT: Not at all.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Actually, it's highly dynamic.

29:25.230 --> 29:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see from this image it
looks to me
a lot like a river system.

29:30.002 --> 29:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice shelves are
connected to
the glaciers that sit on land,
but they are

29:35.107 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also floating, like ice cubes in
a glass of
water.

29:38.610 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you had a drink
with ice cubes
in it, as those ice cube melts,
they don't

29:43.548 --> 29:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
add to the height of the water
in the glass.

29:47.953 --> 29:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when ice shelves break down
and collapse,
they do not have a direct impact
on mean sea

29:53.892 --> 29:54.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level rise.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, they have an indirect
effect.

29:56.995 --> 30:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These ice shelves buttress the
flow of the
ice upstream, the ice that's
flowing into

30:02.234 --> 30:04.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

30:04.036 --> 30:07.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you lose that
buttressing force,
you allow the upstream glaciers
to flow faster.

30:07.773 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's similar to putting
more ice cubes
into the glass and letting those
melt.

30:11.910 --> 30:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice falls off the
edge of glaciers
all the time.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is part of a natural process
called calving.

30:19.151 --> 30:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelly Brunt says it is important
to judge
the size of the piece that
breaks off relative

30:24.990 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the size of the glacier that
is behind
it.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says your fingernails offer
a handy model.

30:31.730 --> 30:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you break your
fingernail
inside the white part of your
fingernail,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you probably don't think much of
it.

30:37.803 --> 30:42.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you break it below the white
part, you
put a Band-Aid on it, you think
about it and

30:42.574 --> 30:43.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you keep an eye on it.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you lose your whole
fingernail, I don't
know what happens.

30:46.578 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's pretty catastrophic.

30:47.979 --> 30:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This represents losing the whole
fingernail.

30:50.148 --> 30:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Like so many
features in Antarctica,
the Larsen Ice Shelf is named
for a famous

30:55.954 --> 30:58.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
19th century explorer.

30:58.757 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is disappearing, section
by section,
identified by letters.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Larsen A disintegrated in 1995.

31:06.431 --> 31:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in 2002, a series of
satellite images
captured the end of Larsen B in
dramatic fashion

31:14.706 --> 31:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the course of six weeks.

31:17.275 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The piece that broke off was the
size of Rhode
Island.

31:20.445 --> 31:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Losing this much
ice, losing
ice that represents roughly the
state of Rhode

31:25.283 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Island in a month-and-a-half,
just far exceeded
anybody's expectations of what
could happen

31:29.721 --> 31:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the time scale that it could
happen.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, it was kind
of like, we
have to rethink things here a
little bit.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a wakeup call.

31:36.027 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This was absolutely
a wakeup
call.

31:38.497 --> 31:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists track
the ice using
a half-dozen U.S. and European
satellites,

31:44.503 --> 31:48.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including Landsat, which
gathered these images.

31:48.173 --> 31:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some of their best data came
from a satellite
called ICESat.

31:52.277 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Launched in 2003, it ceased
operation in 2009.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It precisely measured the
glaciers using laser
beams.

32:00.952 --> 32:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This is quite a few
years of
ICESat data merged together to
get a sense

32:07.192 --> 32:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in meters per year how our ice
sheet is changing.

32:10.495 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see, the big picture
here is that
our ice sheets are changing
where they are

32:14.232 --> 32:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in contact with both our warming
atmosphere
and a warming ocean.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's basically along the
fringe of the
continent.

32:20.438 --> 32:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When ICESat
failed, NASA started
tracking the ice using radar and
lasers on

32:26.678 --> 32:29.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
board low-flying aircraft.

32:29.714 --> 32:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The IceBridge program is NASA's
largest air
campaign ever, but it still
could not match

32:35.554 --> 32:38.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the eye above the sky.

32:38.523 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It goes without saying that you
would view
these satellites, the capability
to look at

32:41.993 --> 32:43.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this, as essential?

32:43.795 --> 32:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: What we're talking
about is a
calving of an iceberg that's a
size of a state.

32:47.599 --> 32:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get that, you really need a
satellite to
be able to see all of it in one
shot.

32:52.470 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a function of scale and
repeatability
to go back and look at that area
again with

32:57.843 --> 33:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the satellite that makes these
the perfect
tools for looking at the
large-scale change

33:02.347 --> 33:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we're seeing in this
region.

33:04.149 --> 33:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Next year, NASA
plans to launch
a new and improved satellite to
watch the

33:09.221 --> 33:10.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ice.

33:10.589 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most likely, the Larsen C Ice
Shelf will be
long gone by then.

33:14.759 --> 33:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the climate warms, there is
no end in sight
to the steady loss of ice here.

33:21.433 --> 33:31.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour."

33:31.743 --> 33:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a closer look
at what could
change if the Affordable Care
Act, often referred

33:41.219 --> 33:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to as Obamacare, is repealed and
replaced.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The battle is expected to last
through the
spring, or longer.

33:47.192 --> 33:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we are starting an
occasional series
on the potential impact if the
current Republican

33:53.565 --> 33:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leadership plan becomes law.

33:56.401 --> 34:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First up, the tax credits that
go to uninsured
people to enable them to buy
coverage.

34:01.740 --> 34:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To qualify under the current
law, this is
dependent on your income and
where you live.

34:07.212 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republican bill is shifting
those criteria.

34:11.116 --> 34:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Income matters, but age is much
more crucial.

34:14.552 --> 34:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get a refundable tax credit,
some people
over 60 could qualify for $4,000
a year.

34:21.293 --> 34:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those between 40 and 50 years
old could qualify
for $3,000 a year.

34:26.865 --> 34:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People under 30 could get
$2,000.

34:30.201 --> 34:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's the chairman of the House
Ways and
Means Committee, Kevin Brady,
talking about

34:34.372 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican approach.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN BRADY (R), Texas: I think
a key element
of the tax credit is that it is
really targeted

34:40.578 --> 34:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and tailored to the individual.

34:42.647 --> 34:47.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is a credit that is
immediately available
to them.

34:47.152 --> 34:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It grows and increases with age
because your
health care costs go up as you
get older.

34:52.123 --> 34:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To help break all
this down,
I'm joined by Julie Rovner of
Kaiser Health

34:56.394 --> 34:57.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

34:57.395 --> 34:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She follows this closely.

34:58.396 --> 34:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the program,
Julie.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why did the Republicans
decide to change
these criteria?

35:02.400 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Well, one
of the problems with the
existing credits

35:05.370 --> 35:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that not enough young,
healthy people were
signing up.

35:08.707 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is an effort to say, we
want to get
more young, healthy people into
the pool.

35:14.079 --> 35:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, now, while the credits are
smaller for
younger people, they're also
going to reduce

35:18.249 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their premiums by changing how
insurers can
charge.

35:21.753 --> 35:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, insurers can only
charge three
times as much for older people
as younger

35:26.391 --> 35:27.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

35:27.392 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to make that five
times as much.

35:29.227 --> 35:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's going to make premiums
much less
expensive for the younger
people, hence, even

35:32.797 --> 35:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the smaller tax credit will go
further.

35:34.699 --> 35:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So how much is
this expected
to change the group of people
who then will

35:40.005 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be able to be eligible for the
tax credit?

35:42.674 --> 35:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, it's not
entirely clear.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to change who are
winners and losers.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Older people will, obviously,
have to pay
more.

35:48.346 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though they get twice as
big a tax credit,
they could be charged five times
as much in

35:52.617 --> 35:54.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
premiums.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's not at all clear that
it's going to
entice that many more younger
people to join

35:58.723 --> 36:00.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

36:00.525 --> 36:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans also wanted to sort
of scale back
how complicated the tax credits
are under

36:03.895 --> 36:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the current Affordable Care Act,
and this
would definitely do that.

36:06.931 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do we have a way
of knowing
how much premiums would change
in cost?

36:11.036 --> 36:14.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, we don't,
other than the
facts that premiums could --
premiums could

36:14.506 --> 36:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change for a lot of different
reasons.

36:16.641 --> 36:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the important things
here is that
premiums vary by where you live
because health

36:20.178 --> 36:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care cost different amounts in
different parts
of the country.

36:23.548 --> 36:29.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you live in a low-cost
part of the
country, that same flat tax
credit would go

36:29.187 --> 36:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much further than if you live in
a much more
expensive part of the country.

36:32.557 --> 36:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The current Affordable Care Act
tax credits
take that into account, because
they are based

36:36.227 --> 36:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on how much the insurance costs
in your area.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
These are not.

36:40.465 --> 36:45.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that
geography issue is
another significant change here.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really the way it all acts
together.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just the tax credits.

36:49.707 --> 36:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the tax credits, plus what
they're based
on, plus how old you are, plus
where you live,

36:54.079 --> 36:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a little bit of income.

36:55.780 --> 37:00.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Affordable Care Act tax
credits are based
almost exclusively on your
income.

37:00.118 --> 37:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They basically say you only have
to spend
a certain percentage of your
income to afford

37:04.122 --> 37:05.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health insurance.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not what these tax
credits would do.

37:07.192 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republicans hope that
there would
be insurance available that
would match or

37:11.696 --> 37:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least almost match these tax
credits, so
that people could afford to buy
coverage.

37:15.166 --> 37:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we see,
Julie, that among
the more conservative
Republicans, they are

37:19.270 --> 37:20.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still unhappy with this
approach.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: They are very
unhappy.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They call it Obamacare-lite.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are tax credits.

37:25.343 --> 37:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're available to people even
who don't
owe any taxes.

37:28.880 --> 37:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republicans say that's a new
entitlement,
and why should they be voting
for a new entitlement,

37:33.585 --> 37:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they were going to repeal the
old one?

37:35.753 --> 37:38.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
leadership defense
of it is what?

37:38.123 --> 37:40.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, the
leadership defense
of it is, they want people --
they don't want

37:41.025 --> 37:42.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to throw people off of their
coverage.

37:42.660 --> 37:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people who
got coverage
based on the existing tax
credits.

37:46.898 --> 37:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There might be different people
who could
afford insurance on the new tax
credits, but

37:51.035 --> 37:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least they wouldn't be taking
them away
and telling everybody, we're not
going to

37:54.172 --> 37:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be giving you any help anymore.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're on your own.

37:57.308 --> 38:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And quickly,
Julie, under this
new proposal, would there be a
lapse in coverage,

38:00.912 --> 38:02.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some kind of penalty?

38:02.547 --> 38:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is in there to protect
people who are
now covered?

38:05.683 --> 38:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, rather the
individual
mandate, where people are
required to either

38:08.686 --> 38:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have coverage or pay a penalty,
what this
says is, if you have a lapse of
more than

38:12.790 --> 38:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
63 days, and then you sign up
again, you have
to pay 30 percent more for a
year.

38:17.996 --> 38:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there would be a penalty
when you re-up,
basically, instead of a penalty
for not having

38:22.834 --> 38:23.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

38:23.835 --> 38:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Julie Rovner, we
thank you.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And next time,
we're going
to take a closer look at the
Medicaid changes

38:29.874 --> 38:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proposed in the American Health
Care Act.

38:43.855 --> 38:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
a look at
a new exhibit about Emily
Dickinson.

38:47.725 --> 38:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

38:52.197 --> 38:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

39:02.941 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
on this International
Women's Day, she is as beloved
as ever.

39:12.984 --> 39:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
on this International
Women's Day, she is as beloved
as ever.

39:19.724 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now, the poet Emily
Dickinson is getting
even more attention and a new
look, in books,

39:23.995 --> 39:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online, on film, and in a major
museum exhibition.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown reports from New
York.

39:28.600 --> 39:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She is at once
among the most
known and most mysterious of
American cultural

39:33.805 --> 39:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figures, Emily Dickinson,
subject of an exhibition
at the Morgan Library and Museum
in New York

39:41.412 --> 39:42.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
titled, "I'm Nobody!

39:42.714 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who Are You?" the first line of
one of her
most famous poems.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who was Emily Dickinson?

39:51.089 --> 39:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scholar Marta Werner offers
this:

39:53.925 --> 40:00.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTA WERNER, D'Youville
College: She is a
constant summons to me to think
about language

40:00.698 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and its preciseness, and not
only its preciseness,
but its power.

40:05.069 --> 40:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: These are the days when
skies resumed
the old.

40:11.042 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here, visitors
can listen to
readings of the poems, while
examining remnants

40:15.813 --> 40:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a circumscribed 19th century
life lived
almost completely in one town,
Amherst, Massachusetts,

40:21.619 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the only known painting of
Dickinson as a
child with her siblings, a
daguerreotype of

40:26.524 --> 40:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her as a young woman, the only
authenticated
photo of the poet.

40:30.895 --> 40:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also a lock of her
auburn hair, a
replica of cut and pressed
botanical specimens,

40:35.667 --> 40:42.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and another of the rose
wallpaper in the bedroom
to which she retreated in her
later years.

40:42.307 --> 40:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This exhibition, with some 100
rarely seen
items, is eager to present a
different, fresh

40:47.812 --> 40:48.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take on Dickinson.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Curator Carolyn Vega:

40:50.615 --> 40:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLYN VEGA, Curator: The
stereotype that
was attached to her very early
on of this

40:54.385 --> 40:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
total recluse, of this woman in
white who
never left her bedroom, who
penned these amazing

40:59.557 --> 41:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verses, like, in a vacuum
almost, in total
seclusion, has really stuck to
her.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're fighting
that?

41:05.596 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAROLYN VEGA: Yes, we're
fighting that, or
just bringing it into context a
little bit.

41:10.601 --> 41:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This Emily
Dickinson engaged
with her times, including the
Civil War years,

41:15.440 --> 41:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through her reading and a
constant correspondence
with friends, leading thinkers,
and others.

41:20.945 --> 41:26.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Often, she sent poems,
sentences, stanzas
and entire poems written on
scraps of paper

41:26.584 --> 41:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and envelopes, even chocolate
wrappers, a
new book, "Envelope Poems," as
well as the

41:29.987 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recent "The Gorgeous Nothings,"
document this
aspect of her work.

41:33.291 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN HOWE, Poet: By God, she
broke the glass
ceiling in poetry.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Emily Dickinson is like a
beacon of verbal
power that will not be silenced.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Susan Howe, a
leading contemporary
poet and Dickinson scholar, the
powerful voice

41:43.501 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Dickinson is best heard and
seen in these
original manuscripts, the
unusual line breaks,

41:44.736 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alternative word choices, poems
as virtual
works of art.

41:46.504 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN HOWE: Ultimately, she
leads me to the
fundamental mystery of all
poetry, which is

41:50.608 --> 41:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the relation between the ear and
the eye.

41:53.711 --> 41:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every mark on paper is an
acoustic mark.

41:57.348 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dickinson breaks down the
barriers between
poetry, prose and ear and eye.

42:07.458 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dickinson breaks down the
barriers between
poetry, prose and ear and eye.

42:18.636 --> 42:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marta Werner, a
leader expert
on Dickinson's manuscripts,
showed me an example.

42:26.978 --> 42:31.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTA WERNER: She talks about
wanting to hinder
time.

42:31.516 --> 42:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as the poem unfolds, the way
that the
writing almost stumbles, right,
performs that

42:38.022 --> 42:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hindering of time, but you're
seeing, to some
extent, the mind thinking.

42:45.630 --> 42:54.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first
editions of Dickinson's
poetry came out only after her
death in 1886,

42:54.806 --> 42:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, from the beginning, editors
ignored her
idiosyncrasies and formatted her
writings

42:59.243 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into a more conventional style.

43:01.078 --> 43:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wrote some 1,800 poems, but
only 10 were
published in newspapers during
her lifetime.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTA WERNER: It's unsigned.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's anonymous.

43:08.853 --> 43:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her name, you know, never
appeared in print
during her lifetime with any of
her poems.

43:12.457 --> 43:19.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's dropped in, in the middle
of this other
column.

43:19.630 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What comes after it is a little
piece on how
to use chloroform.

43:27.638 --> 43:29.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:29.407 --> 43:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dickinson was
thought to be
reticent about seeing her work,
as well as

43:32.243 --> 43:45.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her image in public, so we can
only wonder
what she'd think of "A Quiet
Passion," a film

43:45.356 --> 43:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
due in April starring Cynthia
Nixon.

43:47.291 --> 43:53.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no denying the
continuing fascination
with the woman and love of her
work, as at

43:53.598 --> 44:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marathon readings put on by the
Library of
Congress, and the restoration
under way of

44:02.940 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her Amherst home.

44:04.775 --> 44:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now both scholars and
everyday fans have
access to a trove of original
manuscripts

44:13.918 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more online, digitized from
the collections
of Amherst College, Harvard
University and

44:20.558 --> 44:24.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Boston Public Library.

44:24.095 --> 44:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marta Werner offered a personal
story that
drove home the connection many
feel, how her

44:35.740 --> 44:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dying father, a scientist,
shared his favorite
poems.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTA WERNER: It was his idea.

44:44.982 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He started to write me letters.

44:47.652 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he would ask me to send
back my list
of poems.

44:55.726 --> 44:59.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a very extraordinary
thing.

44:59.397 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's a lot of people
like my father
who love her and can't quite say
why.
