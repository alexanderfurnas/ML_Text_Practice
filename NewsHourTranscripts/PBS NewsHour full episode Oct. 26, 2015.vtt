GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:10.410 --> 00:16.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
powerful earthquake rocks
Afghanistan, rattling parts of
Pakistan

00:16.016 --> 00:22.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and India as well, chaos on the
streets, as the number of dead
and injured climbs.

00:22.456 --> 00:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: a meat lover's
nightmare. The World Health
Organization finds eating bacon,

00:27.761 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sausage, and other processed
meats can raise the risk of
cancer.

00:32.666 --> 00:37.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Secretary of Education
Arne Duncan on reducing the
amount of testing in the
nation's

00:37.004 --> 00:38.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARNE DUNCAN, U.S. Education
Secretary: Where we are doing
things that are redundant, or

00:41.475 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
duplicative, or not helpful,
well, that's a waste of
everyone's time and energy.

00:45.045 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And going beyond the
headlines, what two teenagers'
lives tell us about the

00:49.383 --> 00:52.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cycle of attacks in
the Middle East.

00:52.853 --> 00:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: All this
playing out amid a surge of
violence between Palestinians
and

00:57.357 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israelis, the story of Naor and
Ahmed a microcosm of a wider
narrative.

01:02.162 --> 01:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:08.902 --> 01:13.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.573 --> 01:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The death toll is
still climbing from the powerful
earthquake that struck
Northeastern

01:23.483 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghanistan much earlier today.
At least 263 were killed, most
of them in neighboring Pakistan.

01:30.390 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The quake was centered deep
under the Hindu Kush mountains,
but at magnitude 7.5, its

01:35.128 --> 01:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reach extended well into India.

01:38.832 --> 01:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News has this report.

01:43.403 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Gilgit, on Pakistan's border
with Afghanistan, the earthquake
caused a landslide. A security

01:52.212 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camera in Mingora in Pakistan
captured the moment in someone's
garage. And the news reader

02:01.088 --> 02:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Ariana TV in the Afghan
capital, Kabul, found himself
unable to continue.

02:12.599 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several buildings in Kabul
crumbled, even though the
epicenter of the quake was 400

02:16.770 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kilometers to the north.

02:19.439 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
felt the earthquake. We tried to
get out of the house. It was
very

02:23.577 --> 02:28.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
big. The walls were destroyed.

02:28.115 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Now there's
a danger of aftershocks.

02:32.652 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nearer the epicenter, in
Taloqan, a girls school was
struck. At least 12 students
were

02:39.659 --> 02:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed trying to rush out, while
more than 40 were taken to
hospital. People here are

02:46.500 --> 02:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor and deprived at the best of
times. Hospitals are
rudimentary.

02:52.839 --> 02:58.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Pakistan border city of
Peshawar, several houses
collapsed. Earthquakes hit the
poor

02:58.779 --> 03:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more than the rich because
their homes are less sturdily
built. The quake struck

03:05.318 --> 03:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hardest in remote mountainous
areas of Pakistan and
Afghanistan. There is little
precise information

03:11.291 --> 03:15.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet of how many were killed or
how great the damage. Though
there is no doubt people will

03:15.529 --> 03:19.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need help, it will be
hard to get it to them.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Authorities in both
Afghanistan and Pakistan say the
casualty count is expected

03:23.904 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rise as rescuers reach
more remote areas.

03:29.643 --> 03:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Migrants and refugees surged
across the Balkan states again
today, after European leaders

03:34.347 --> 03:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held an emergency summit. Police
in Croatia said more than 13,000
people have crossed

03:40.520 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its eastern border with Serbia
within the past 24 hours. And
nearly 10,000 moved on

03:45.559 --> 03:49.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Croatia westward
to Slovenia.

03:49.529 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Brussels, European
Union leaders said they
committed early today to bring
order

03:53.300 --> 03:55.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the chaos.

03:55.936 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President,
European Commission: The only
way to restore order to the
situation

04:01.141 --> 04:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to slow down the uncontrolled
flows of people. The policy of
waving through people

04:07.714 --> 04:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to neighboring countries has to
stop. I want to be clear. People
must be registrated, no

04:13.420 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
registration, no rights.

04:16.823 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The E.U. leaders
agreed to accommodate 100,000
people at registration centers
and

04:21.661 --> 04:24.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to give Greece more help.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the U.N.'s
humanitarian office said today,
new fighting in Syria has
displaced

04:29.603 --> 04:35.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least another 120,000 people.
That's more than double an
earlier estimate.

04:35.976 --> 04:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An anti-migrant faction in
Poland scored big in Sunday
elections. The conservative Law

04:41.414 --> 04:46.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Justice Party celebrated
last night after winning an a
near majority in Parliament.

04:46.753 --> 04:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The group opposes taking in
migrants and adopting the euro
currency.

04:51.791 --> 04:56.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives in Argentina also
did well, as opposition
presidential candidate Mauricio

04:56.163 --> 05:01.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Macri forced a run-off with the
ruling party's nominee on
Sunday.

05:01.701 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Guatemala, former TV
comedian Jimmy Morales
overwhelmingly won the
presidency.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He attacked corruption and
promised smartphones for
children.

05:11.611 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word this evening of a
possible two-year budget deal in
Congress. House and Senate

05:16.816 --> 05:20.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
aides say it would allow
increased spending, despite
budget caps, but defense would
increase

05:20.854 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than domestic programs.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest confirmed the ongoing
talks today, but said it is not

05:27.260 --> 05:29.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a done deal.

05:29.529 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: We have worked
assiduously to protect the

05:37.571 --> 05:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
privacy and confidentiality of
those discussions, principally
because they're based on this

05:43.410 --> 05:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
principle that nothing is agreed
to in the context of those
discussions until everything

05:47.547 --> 05:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is agreed to. And as I stand
here today, not everything has
been agreed to. That means

05:52.686 --> 05:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that nothing at this point
has been agreed to.

05:55.388 --> 06:00.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Without a deal, the
government will run out of money
on December 11. Any

06:00.460 --> 06:03.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement could also include an
increase in the federal
borrowing limit that expires
November

06:03.697 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
3.

06:06.700 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An Oklahoma judge ordered a
mental evaluation today for a
woman accused of driving her car

06:12.405 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a homecoming crowd at
Oklahoma State University.
Adacia Chambers is being held

06:18.144 --> 06:23.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on $1 million bond. She faces
preliminary counts of
second-degree murder. Four
people

06:23.717 --> 06:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died and dozens of others were
injured in Saturday's crash.
Chambers' lawyer denied

06:28.221 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was drunk or taking drugs at
the time. He said she's mentally
ill.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators in Vancouver,
Canada, worked today to figure
out why a whale watching boat

06:38.965 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sank. Five British citizens died
in Sunday's incident. One is
still missing. Amateur video

06:44.871 --> 06:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed the 65-foot vessel
partially submerged late Sunday
afternoon off Tofino on
Vancouver

06:51.144 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Island. Rescuers and others
rushed to the waterfront to
help.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSIE OSBORNE, Tofino, British
Columbia, Mayor: The outpouring
from the community has been

06:57.350 --> 07:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phenomenal. And seeing the way
people come forward and they're
offering everything from

07:01.655 --> 07:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
food and blankets and clothing
to just people to be with people
and help them and helping

07:09.929 --> 07:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ambulance, the paramedics,
the hospital staff, everything,
it's -- businesses, everybody.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It just comes out and
says, what can I do?

07:15.302 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In all, there
were 27 people on the boat.

07:20.473 --> 07:24.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remnants of Hurricane Patricia
moved along the Gulf Coast
today. Heavy rain continued

07:24.778 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Eastern Texas to the
Florida Panhandle, and flash
flood alerts were up for several

07:30.150 --> 07:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states. Meanwhile, Texas was
starting to dry out after the
system dumped more than a foot

07:33.653 --> 07:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of rain over the weekend.

07:37.123 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The University of Mississippi
today has removed the state flag
from its place of honor on

07:42.028 --> 07:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campus. The flag includes the
Confederate battle emblem, and
students, faculty and others

07:46.566 --> 07:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had urged that it be taken down.
University police lowered the
banner this morning, and

07:50.570 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
took it to the
school's archives.

07:53.373 --> 07:58.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street had trouble making
any headway today. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost

07:58.712 --> 08:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
23 points to close at 17623. The
Nasdaq rose nearly three points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped

08:05.652 --> 08:07.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
four.

08:07.921 --> 08:12.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the National Football League
is claiming success with letting
people worldwide watch

08:12.492 --> 08:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a game online for free, instead
of showing it on television.
Yahoo! streamed Sunday's

08:18.631 --> 08:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Buffalo-Jacksonville game in
London, and got more than 33
million views. The league says

08:24.137 --> 08:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the experiment proves streaming
can become the main means of
distribution for more games.

08:30.543 --> 08:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the secretary of education
rethinks testing in U.S.
schools;

08:36.116 --> 08:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how eating bacon might cause
cancer; an inside look at
restoring the work of Italy's
master

08:41.354 --> 08:49.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
painters, and much more.

08:49.929 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to standardized
testing in schools, how much is
too much?

09:01.207 --> 09:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a policy reversal, the Obama
administration, which has
supported student and teacher
assessment,

09:07.013 --> 09:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now says testing has gotten out
of hand. This weekend, the White
House recommended capping

09:10.984 --> 09:14.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testing at 2 percent
of class time.

09:14.687 --> 09:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new report conducted by the
Council of Great City Schools
found the average student sits

09:18.958 --> 09:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for as many as 112 mandatory
standardized tests between
kindergarten and high school

09:23.696 --> 09:26.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
graduation.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier today, I sat down with
the outgoing education
secretary, Arne Duncan, and
Michael

09:31.838 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Casserly, the executive director
of the Council of Great City
Schools, about the problem and

09:35.742 --> 09:38.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the proposed solutions.

09:38.344 --> 09:43.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Casserly, Secretary Duncan,
thank you very much for joining
us.

09:43.650 --> 09:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Duncan, you first
started talking about the
inadequacies of testing and the

09:47.887 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shortfalls, the flaws two, three
years ago. What took so long for
the Education Department

09:52.425 --> 09:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to embrace this idea today?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARNE DUNCAN, U.S. Education
Secretary: Well, I think we have
embraced this idea for a while.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's different now is we
actually have data. And I have
been talking about this, as you

10:02.035 --> 10:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, for a while, and the
president has. But what we had
were lots of anecdotes. And

10:05.939 --> 10:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we knew we needed to get to a
better spot, but no one had ever
surveyed the nation.

10:09.876 --> 10:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I went to Mike about two
years ago and said, would you be
willing to ask your districts

10:15.448 --> 10:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what to do in this space? And he
was ahead of me. He said, guess
what? We're already

10:16.249 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing it.

10:18.451 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's taken them two years.
It's that complicated to get
together. But now we're beyond
anecdotes.

10:23.556 --> 10:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have facts, and where there
is too much time spent on
testing, a redundancy or
duplicative

10:29.028 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuff, that doesn't make any
sense. And we both want high
standards. We both want good

10:32.031 --> 10:34.968 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
assessments that
drive instruction.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But where we're wasting students
time, where we're adding stress,
we need to challenge

10:38.037 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that status quo. And that's
exactly what we're trying to do.

10:40.740 --> 10:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. Casserly, some
people have already said that
the solution is not the

10:46.112 --> 10:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solution. The federal government
saying you should put this cap
on testing is not the

10:51.618 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solution to the overtesting that
started in the first place.

10:54.754 --> 10:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CASSERLY, Executive
Director, Council of Great City
Schools: Well, I actually agree

10:55.355 --> 10:57.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with that.

10:57.390 --> 11:04.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think this is a very
complicated issue. It involves
the time that's devoted to
testing.

11:04.130 --> 11:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It involves the quality of the
test. It involves the redundancy
of the test. It involves the

11:08.301 --> 11:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use of the test. It involves all
kinds of pretty complicated
factors.

11:14.240 --> 11:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might solve a little bit of
the time problem by putting a
time cap on this, but you could

11:20.280 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also do damage at the same time
if you don't address some of
those other questions. So

11:26.252 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you lowered the cap to, say,
1 percent, you could still have
redundancy in the test,

11:31.391 --> 11:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you could still have bad
tests. There may be less of
them. But you haven't solved

11:35.061 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the larger problem.

11:37.230 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, how do you guard
against unintended consequences,
as happened from the testing?

11:41.734 --> 11:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CASSERLY: Well, I think
one of the things that all of us
have to do now is to

11:47.040 --> 11:52.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have a more thoughtful
conversation about what smart
assessments would actually be
and

11:52.378 --> 11:55.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see if we can figure out some
way to coordinate this a lot
better across federal, state and

11:55.715 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
local entities.

11:58.117 --> 12:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that was
really clear to us from the
research that we did on this was

12:03.289 --> 12:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these entities don't
necessarily talk to each other.
These layers of the education

12:09.829 --> 12:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apparatus don't necessarily talk
to each other. So we have plenty
of examples where people

12:16.302 --> 12:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were administering overlapping
tests, and kids were actually
toggling back and forth

12:21.507 --> 12:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from one test to another, when
it could have been solved by
just having differing layers

12:26.713 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of government talk to each
other a little bit better.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Secretary Duncan,
government talking to each other
is not necessarily what
government

12:33.152 --> 12:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does best. In fact, there are
people who say that part of the
overtesting was a result

12:38.191 --> 12:44.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people trying to meet
standards that you were
promoting, Race to the Top,
Common Core

12:44.764 --> 12:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standards, and, as a result, you
kept layering one test on top of
the other.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you feel that you might have
some responsibility for that?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ARNE DUNCAN: Oh, no,
I think we all do.

12:51.337 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, Gwen, what has been
so -- what I have appreciated so
much is, this is -- honestly,

12:55.141 --> 13:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is real leadership in
action. This is our major urban
school districts coming together

13:00.380 --> 13:05.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and saying we need to do better.
This is the state chief officers
coming together with

13:05.451 --> 13:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us saying we need to do better.
And it's us being
self-reflective and looking in
the mirror

13:07.620 --> 13:09.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and say we want to
do better together.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as you know better than I,
so often, in Washington, people
just yell and point

13:13.059 --> 13:16.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fingers and they just get louder
about I'm right and everyone
else is wrong. I think

13:16.896 --> 13:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we're all trying to do is
say, how do we better partner,
how do we better advice,

13:20.266 --> 13:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how do we get to a better
spot for children?

13:23.202 --> 13:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, the goal here is not to
test. The goal is to improve
instruction, to improve what

13:28.107 --> 13:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going on every single day for
that child in classroom. And
where we're getting good

13:31.811 --> 13:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information to teachers and to
parents and to students
themselves that empower them to

13:35.481 --> 13:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
build upon strengths and work on
weaknesses, that's a good thing.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where we are doing things that
are redundant, or duplicative,
or not helpful, well, that's

13:41.954 --> 13:44.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a waste of everyone's
time and energy.

13:44.190 --> 13:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, it's not just
Washington. A lot of the
movement to opt out of these

13:47.593 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tests started in local school
districts and around the country
with parents, with teachers.

13:52.498 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How much of that will be
satisfied by Washington saying
do less?

13:57.270 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARNE DUNCAN: Well, I think there
are two sides of this coin,
folks who think we just need

14:01.474 --> 14:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do more and more testing. I
think that is wrong. Folks who
think we shouldn't do

14:03.876 --> 14:07.480 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
any assessments,
that's equally wrong.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a commonsense
middle ground here. This is very
much a civil rights issue.
Historically

14:11.417 --> 14:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this nation, we swept under
the rug the horrific disparities
in outcomes, the horrific

14:17.356 --> 14:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achievement gap between black
and white students and Latino
and white students and poor
students

14:22.562 --> 14:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and wealthier students. Too much
testing is bad. Walking away
from assessment is equally

14:25.498 --> 14:27.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's find the commonsense
middle ground. I think that's
what we're all striving to

14:28.801 --> 14:30.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do and to do together.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It doesn't sound
like you have figured out where
that sweet spot is, Mr.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Casserly.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL CASSERLY: No,
we really haven't.

14:35.942 --> 14:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of our goal here was
just to gather some data on how
much testing was actually

14:40.580 --> 14:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done. We haven't figured out the
right balance yet. We did
announce today that the Council

14:48.654 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Great City Schools, in
coordination with Council of
Chief State School Officers,
would

14:53.292 --> 14:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
form a commission to start
looking at exactly what the
right balance would be, what
would

14:58.297 --> 15:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
models and options for school
districts be that would present
a much more rational and

15:03.102 --> 15:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intelligent assessment system.

15:05.571 --> 15:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the meantime,
there has been a huge, I would
say, explosion of a business

15:11.377 --> 15:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
model which is based on testing.
Don't you anticipate pushback
from those companies who

15:16.015 --> 15:18.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been behind a
lot of these tests?

15:18.384 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CASSERLY: oh, I think
the answer to that is, yes, of
course we do. We're not naive

15:23.256 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this and we certainly
don't think that just because we
put out some data about how

15:27.393 --> 15:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much testing it is that all of a
sudden the test publishers are
going to go, oh, gee,

15:31.364 --> 15:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heavens, I never knew, we should
stop selling these tests.

15:35.568 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't believe that for a
second. But I do think that, in
cooperation with the federal

15:42.175 --> 15:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government, the Department of
Education, the states and the
big urban public school systems,

15:49.448 --> 15:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can at least start
creating a more intelligent
conversation about what it is

15:52.919 --> 15:55.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we buy.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARNE DUNCAN: Gwen, if I could
add, I think it's just so
important part of the
conversation

15:58.391 --> 16:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on the amount, and that's an
important conversation to have,
but that's maybe half

16:01.794 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the battle here.

16:04.697 --> 16:09.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big thing that we have to
get to is, are these assessments
high-quality? And so, for

16:09.368 --> 16:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example, if folks just cut back
testing and they go to
fill-in-the-bubble tests, that

16:13.239 --> 16:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be a disaster. We want
writing to be assessed. That
takes a little time. We want

16:17.577 --> 16:22.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
critical thinking to be
assessed, and so making sure
that there are high-quality
assessments

16:22.081 --> 16:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are available in real time,
the results, to teachers, to
parents, to students, so that,

16:27.153 --> 16:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again, instruction improves on
a daily, on a weekly basis.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How do you measure
effectiveness? That's the other
piece of this. It's one thing

16:33.993 --> 16:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have quality. It's another
thing to have quantity.

16:37.163 --> 16:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then you have to be able to
measure that learning has
actually approved. And that's

16:41.033 --> 16:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been the defense which testers
have used, which is we need to
have that basic line.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARNE DUNCAN: I think the world
is changing and it's really
important.

16:48.608 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Historically, Gwen, as you know,
you had 50 different states
doing 50 different tests,

16:53.546 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which you couldn't compare and
frankly cost a heck of a lot
more money because everyone

16:56.148 --> 17:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was doing their own thing. And
what you now have, again, thanks
to Mike's leadership and

17:01.387 --> 17:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state chief officers and
others' leadership, governors'
leadership, is you have more and

17:04.657 --> 17:07.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more states starting
to work together.

17:07.426 --> 17:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the real key in all this,
Gwen, is how do we accelerate
the pace of change? Who

17:11.564 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is doing a fantastic job with
English-language learners? Who
is doing a great job in rural

17:16.402 --> 17:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities, or in inner-city
communities, or in Native
American reservations and how

17:19.372 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do we replicate and share what
is working and scale those best
practices?

17:23.009 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you think
it can be effective?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ARNE DUNCAN: I know
it can be effective.

17:27.246 --> 17:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I visit schools all --
probably more schools than
almost anybody across 50 states
and I

17:31.751 --> 17:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see extraordinary work. We met
with two teachers earlier today
who talked about how the data

17:36.289 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're getting is helping them
not to teach to 25 or 30
students in aggregate, but to

17:40.559 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teach individually, personalized
way -- in a personalized way to
every single child and

17:44.297 --> 17:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help them get to where
they need to go.

17:46.966 --> 17:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a lot of learning to do
going forward, but great
assessments actually improve
instruction,

17:53.506 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
drive right teaching and
learning, are not in conflict
with it. We just have to make

17:56.909 --> 17:59.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that more the norm and
not the exception.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Secretary Arne
Duncan, Michael Casserly, thank
you both very much.

18:01.480 --> 18:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CASSERLY: Thank you.

18:01.948 --> 18:07.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ARNE DUNCAN: Thank you.

18:07.353 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We return now to the
violence that's lately consuming
Israel and the Palestinian

18:18.364 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
territories.

18:20.700 --> 18:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on one single
event involving two young
teenage boys on October 12, an
episode

18:27.707 --> 18:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which has triggered more anger
and response than any of the
others in the latest wave.

18:33.079 --> 18:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Martin Seemungal returned to the
scene to find out more about

18:38.417 --> 18:42.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
happened, and how it has
affected the already fractured
relationship between local
Israelis

18:42.388 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Palestinians.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A warning: This report
contains some graphic images.

18:48.427 --> 18:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The scenes on
this street are calm, giving no
indication of the violence

18:54.734 --> 19:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happened here. The video is
too graphic to show: a
13-year-old boy on the ground
bleeding.

19:01.640 --> 19:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The boy is Ahmed Manasra, a
Palestinian. The story leading
up to this shocking moment is

19:07.013 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as disturbing as the video.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EYAL ELBAZI, Witness: He stabbed
a little kid right here.

19:12.284 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Police have
accused Ahmed and his
15-year-old cousin Hassan of
stabbing

19:16.822 --> 19:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two Israelis, one also 13 years
old. Police released
closed-circuit video footage of
what

19:23.729 --> 19:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they say are Ahmed and Hassan
running from the scene armed
with knives. Minutes later,

19:30.302 --> 19:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another camera shows Hassan
lunging across the train tracks
at police, before he is shot

19:34.407 --> 19:37.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and killed.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ahmed is pursued by police
and a furious crowd.

19:40.679 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Eyal Elbazi was in that crowd.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EYAL ELBAZI: What can you do?
You see him running up to that
area that there's a lot

19:48.888 --> 19:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people over there. We thought
he is running out stabbing more
people.

19:52.792 --> 19:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: They caught
him at the train tracks.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
According to the initial
reports, Ahmed wound up here on
the tracks because he was hit by

20:01.700 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a car, but the Israeli doctors
who treated him say his injuries
fit the profile of someone

20:07.440 --> 20:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had been struck by a blunt
instrument. We may never know,
but we do know that the

20:12.011 --> 20:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video triggered widespread
anger among Palestinians.

20:17.750 --> 20:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went viral on social media.
The cell phone video, recorded
by an Israeli bystander, was

20:23.589 --> 20:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
viewed millions of times on
Facebook, complete with
background sound of people
cursing at

20:28.227 --> 20:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him. His father, Saleh, says
it was unbearable to watch.

20:32.798 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALEH MANASRA, Father (through
translator): A policeman kicked
him on the leg twice. A

20:38.370 --> 20:42.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second Israeli called him names.
The third was calling, "Kill
him, kill him." If it was

20:42.675 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cat or a dog on the road, you
would help it. He was a child.
No one helped him.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Mysone
Mahane MD-BO is Ahmed's aunt.

20:50.282 --> 20:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYSONE MAHANE, Aunt: I was very
shocked when I saw the picture.
This is the first picture

20:56.021 --> 21:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have seen. We were very
shocked. Yes, I cried. Of
course, I cried.

21:00.493 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: But Elbazi
says the video didn't tell the
whole story.

21:05.798 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EYAL ELBAZI: After one or two
guys was trying to stop him with
a knife and his craziness,

21:14.306 --> 21:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they beat him up a little bit.
Yes, they beat him up, but a lot
of Israelis stopped them

21:18.477 --> 21:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to -- enough, enough, enough,

21:21.447 --> 21:26.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And Elbazi
points out that Ahmed did
receive medical treatment along

21:26.018 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the 13-year-old Jewish boy
he allegedly stabbed. That boy,
simply known as Naor -- his

21:32.725 --> 21:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
full name hasn't been released
-- stumbled away from the scene
and collapsed before paramedics

21:36.829 --> 21:39.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stabilized him.

21:39.465 --> 21:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His family declined to be
interviewed. But we spoke to
others who know him, including

21:43.435 --> 21:45.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his classmates.

21:45.638 --> 21:50.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DANIEL, Friend (through
translator): He is a fine boy, a
good boy, very sociable, very

21:50.342 --> 21:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friendly. He loves everyone. We
are his friends. He is in our
class.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Well-known to
the shopkeepers in the
neighborhood, Gil Tzemach says
he came

21:58.484 --> 22:01.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his store often.

22:01.453 --> 22:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIL TZEMACH, Shopkeeper (through
translator): I feel pain for the
victim for a boy who basically

22:05.291 --> 22:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just came to buy some candy. It
could have been me 20 seconds
before or after.

22:09.962 --> 22:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Ahmed is also
described as quiet and
well-liked. His mother showed

22:14.333 --> 22:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us these pictures. He is fond of
animals, keeps pets, a turtle,
and pigeons. None of

22:20.806 --> 22:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his friends or family believe
Ahmed attacked 13-year-old Naor
with a knife, especially

22:25.411 --> 22:27.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his father.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALEH MANASRA (through
translator): A 13-year-old boy
is not able to stab anyone. He
is not

22:31.317 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
physically strong
enough to do it.

22:33.485 --> 22:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYSONE MAHANE: We don't support
killing, not for Jews, not for
any -- for Israelis. We

22:40.192 --> 22:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't support this, of course,
especially the honest people,
the innocent people,
Palestinians

22:45.531 --> 22:48.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
or Israelis. We
don't support this.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Even Elbazi,
one of the Israeli witnesses to
the attack, is finding

22:51.203 --> 22:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it difficult to comprehend, but
thinks he knows what happened.

22:55.140 --> 23:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EYAL ELBAZI: I think 13 year old
doesn't know what to think. I
don't think his father knew.

23:01.647 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think his mother knew. I
don't think the family knew
about it. I think he did it

23:06.385 --> 23:10.689 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
from Facebook or
something like that.

23:10.689 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think his dad will
approve something like that. Any
dad wouldn't approve his son

23:16.061 --> 23:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will go and to murder people.
It's not right. It's wrong. He's
13 years old. He's not supposed

23:21.100 --> 23:22.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

23:22.935 --> 23:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: All of this is
playing out amid a surge of
violence between Palestinians

23:26.639 --> 23:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Israelis, the story of Naor
and Ahmed a microcosm of a wider
narrative.

23:33.045 --> 23:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Naor comes from Pisgat Ze'ev, a
Jewish settlement in Eastern
Jerusalem. It is built on land

23:39.318 --> 23:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captured by Israel in 1967, and
is considered illegal under
international law. Israel
disputes

23:45.391 --> 23:47.726 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

23:47.726 --> 23:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ahmed comes from the Palestinian
village of Beit Hanina. Pisgat
Ze'ev and Beit Hanina

23:53.599 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are separated by a highway, but
there is an enormous cultural
and religious divide. Jews

24:00.472 --> 24:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Pisgat Ze'ev say they rarely
come to Beit Hanina because they
are afraid of being attacked.

24:04.810 --> 24:08.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there is mistrust
and fear on both sides.

24:08.647 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has it changed attitudes of you
and your classmates towards
Israelis?

24:14.586 --> 24:20.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED, Palestinian: We hate
them, yes. They're bad people.
They kill Palestinians.

24:20.759 --> 24:24.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL:
Fifteen-year-old Mohammed, also
from Beit Hanina and a close
friend of

24:24.163 --> 24:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ahmed's now deceased cousin,
said he was moved watching the
video.

24:29.034 --> 24:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED: He was laying down. He
got up. He was -- a lot of
blood, but they were looking

24:34.707 --> 24:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at him and they were not helping
him. They were not helping him.
That felt so bad.

24:41.447 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Speaking to
young people from both sides of
this divide, it was hard

24:45.784 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to imagine a future much
brighter than their parents'.

24:49.855 --> 24:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY (through translator): Our
friend Naor was exactly the same
age as the Palestinian

24:54.126 --> 24:58.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kid who stabbed him. Now
I hate Arabs even more.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NOAM, Israel (through
translator): I felt like
grabbing a knife and stabbing
Arabs as

25:02.901 --> 25:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revenge. My friend did nothing.
He was on his way back home on a
bike. And then when

25:07.506 --> 25:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw the attacker injured, I
felt good watching him being
injured. I'm not against all
Arabs,

25:11.443 --> 25:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just bad Arabs who commit
terrorist attacks.

25:14.713 --> 25:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The evening of
the incident, Israeli police
raided the Manasra home in

25:19.618 --> 25:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beit Hanina, confiscating phones
and belongings. Ahmed's cousin
was arrested.

25:26.024 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Two nights later, police
returned, following up on
reports that Palestinians in
Beit Hanina

25:31.196 --> 25:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were throwing rocks at cars
entering Pisgat Ze'ev. The
police commander delivered a
very

25:36.668 --> 25:42.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
clear message to Ahmed's
extended family gathered in the
courtyard.

25:42.174 --> 25:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): If
another person comes out and
throws a stone or a bottle onto

25:47.980 --> 25:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the road, everyone who is
standing here, I promise, I will
break his arms and legs.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The stabbing
incident also led to acrimony at
the highest levels. At

25:56.688 --> 26:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one point, Palestinian leader
Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of
executing young Palestinians,

26:02.861 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
referencing the video of Ahmed
lying on the ground as evidence,
prompting a swift and

26:08.801 --> 26:13.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
angry response from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

26:13.305 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He accused Abbas of incitement
and produced a video showing
Ahmed being fed in his hospital

26:19.645 --> 26:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bed. Ahmed's family said their
lawyer was the one feeding him.
Tareq Barghout says he

26:25.350 --> 26:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was feeding Ahmed Jell-O when
someone from Prime Minister
Netanyahu's office arrived.

26:29.988 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAREQ BARGHOUT, Attorney
(through translator): I felt
disgusted. I put on Facebook,
look,

26:34.359 --> 26:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the battle is now in the media.
It's not legal. They violated
the law. It's illegal to publish

26:38.263 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a photo of a minor
while he is detained.

26:40.866 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Dr. Asher
Salmon is the deputy director of
the hospital where Ahmed

26:44.570 --> 26:46.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was treated.

26:46.872 --> 26:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ASHER SALMON, Hospital
Deputy Director: In general, I
would prefer that minors
wouldn't

26:49.675 --> 26:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be videotaped, would not -- and
pictures wouldn't be discharged.
But in a condition when false

26:55.180 --> 27:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data is spread all over the
world that this kid was
executed, killed, whatever, so I
think

27:01.753 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it had put things in
the proper context.

27:05.123 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Hadassah
Hospital in Ein Kerem in
Jerusalem prides itself for
treating

27:10.462 --> 27:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all patients equally, Israelis
and Palestinians. Dr. Salmon
says they were criticized by
some

27:15.767 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for treating Ahmed.

27:18.003 --> 27:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ASHER SALMON: I did hear
words like, why do you treat
terrorists? Terrorists should

27:22.474 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be killed, and things like that
which, of course, I am not even
going to respond to

27:26.678 --> 27:29.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these type of comments.

27:29.381 --> 27:35.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The same
policy exists at the Hadassah
Hospital on Mount Scopus, where

27:35.087 --> 27:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
13-year-old Naor is being
treated. In fact, Naor's lead
doctor is Arab-Israeli, the one

27:40.325 --> 27:42.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who took the father
to his son's bedside.

27:42.895 --> 27:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DR. AHMED EID, Hadassah
Hospital: He knew because I told
him. I am Ahmed Eid, my name.

27:47.966 --> 27:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess that he figured that I
am not Jew, I am Arab. So, it
was clear to him.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And
there were no issues?

27:54.406 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. AHMED EID: No. No.

27:56.742 --> 28:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Ilanit Tal is
the head nurse on the ward where
Naor is being treated. She

28:01.647 --> 28:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says it is a mixed staff and
this recent wave of violence is
particularly painful to deal

28:06.118 --> 28:08.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

28:08.020 --> 28:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ILANIT TAL, Nurse: I'm used to
this attack in Jerusalem, but
not with children. It's

28:13.926 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult to see that -- the
children attacking us, it's
difficult, you know, and
children

28:17.796 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being hurt, it's not
-- it's different.

28:22.834 --> 28:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Naor is no
longer in critical condition and
is expected to be discharged

28:28.373 --> 28:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from hospital next week. Ahmed
was released from hospital, but
remains under arrest. Police

28:35.781 --> 28:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are treating him as a terrorist
an, he is expected to be charged
with attempted murder.

28:40.786 --> 28:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Martin Seemungal in Jerusalem.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

28:59.972 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on NewsHour": some
presidential campaigns ramp up,
while others scale back;

29:04.977 --> 29:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what it takes to bring new
life to centuries-old
masterpieces.

29:09.748 --> 29:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, as you have probably
heard in a headline or two by
now, it was a sobering

29:15.320 --> 29:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day for meat lovers, especially
in a country that ranks second
in the world for eating

29:18.790 --> 29:21.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the most meat.

29:21.727 --> 29:26.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham has the story
and some perspective on what you
need to know.

29:26.031 --> 29:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This new
report released today by the
World Health Organization found

29:30.469 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that often-beloved meats, like
sausage, bacon, ham, and hot
dogs, can cause certain types

29:35.941 --> 29:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cancer. Prior studies had
established similar connections,
but the WHO is the most
prominent

29:40.712 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
health organization to
specifically say processed meats
can cause cancer.

29:45.417 --> 29:49.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looked at more than 800
studies around the world. It
also found that eating freshly

29:49.821 --> 29:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prepared red meat like steak or
pork or lamb probably can cause
cancer as well.

29:54.960 --> 29:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here to help us sort through
this is Jonathan Schoenfeld. He
is a professor of radiation

29:59.131 --> 30:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oncology at Harvard Medical
School, He co-wrote a notable
paper for "The American Journal

30:03.502 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Clinical Nutrition" in 2012
about the links between diet and
cancer.

30:07.339 --> 30:11.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Schoenfeld, thank
you for doing this.

30:11.176 --> 30:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The WHO certainly put the scare
into meat eaters all over the
country today. How much

30:16.314 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this -- if I'm someone who
has a couple of slices of bacon
or a turkey sandwich a

30:19.551 --> 30:23.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
few times a week, how
worried should I be?

30:23.121 --> 30:25.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD,
Harvard Medical School: Sure.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I Think it's important to
realize that what the World
Health Organization was, like

30:29.528 --> 30:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you said, as looked at hundreds
of studies and put the evidence
from those studies together

30:35.734 --> 30:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to show that the consumption of
processed or red meats was quite
possibly associated

30:40.872 --> 30:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with an increased risk of a
variety of different types of
cancer.

30:44.876 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what these studies did was
look at the overall risk of
cancer. And so it's hard to

30:51.316 --> 30:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that any one piece of bacon,
for example, or piece of meat
would increase your risk

30:57.355 --> 31:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of cancer by a certain amount,
but, in total, you know, these
studies show that being one

31:02.260 --> 31:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the people who consume the
most amounts of meats or
processed foods could
potentially

31:06.064 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
increase your risk
of these cancers.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's
break this down a little bit.
When we say processed meats,

31:10.869 --> 31:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what are we talking about?

31:12.804 --> 31:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD: So,
it's actually a definition that
encompasses a variety of

31:17.042 --> 31:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different ways to add flavor
or to help preserve the meats.

31:22.147 --> 31:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the different studies that
the World Health Organization
looked at might have had a
slightly

31:26.485 --> 31:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different definition of what
processed meats meant. So it
could be things like salting,

31:31.690 --> 31:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it could be things like adding
chemicals to help preserve the
food, or to help add flavor

31:34.760 --> 31:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to these different foods.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is it the
process of processing itself
that causes the problems or is
it the

31:40.932 --> 31:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cooking of processed meats?

31:43.201 --> 31:46.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD:
You really couldn't say.

31:46.905 --> 31:53.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the authors of this report
admit as much. What they could
look at is the total. The

31:53.011 --> 31:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act of processing the meat or
the consumption of the processed
meat was associated with

31:58.183 --> 32:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an increased risk of cancer, but
the studies don't allow you to
actually dissect that further

32:02.587 --> 32:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and figure out what exactly it
is about processed meats that
may lead to the increased risk.

32:08.026 --> 32:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know a lot
of people in the attempt to be
-- to lead a healthier life

32:12.831 --> 32:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and eat healthier foods have
switched to things like chicken
and turkey.

32:16.635 --> 32:20.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If those meats are processed, do
those same risks come along with
them?

32:20.038 --> 32:25.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD: It's
something that's unknown.

32:25.277 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is certainly some
rationale to think that that
might be the case, but these
studies

32:30.482 --> 32:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically looked at the
processing of red meat and
whether or not that posed an
increased

32:34.186 --> 32:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
risk of these types of cancers.

32:36.488 --> 32:40.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, my
understanding is that the WHO
has now put processed meats in

32:40.926 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same category as cigarettes.
And we have seen some headlines
today asking, basically,

32:46.531 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is eating a hot dog now
like smoking a cigarette?

32:50.836 --> 32:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Help me understand that. What is
the level of risk here? Or is
that outlandish to say?

32:54.906 --> 32:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD: Yes, I
think that's a very important
point.

32:58.710 --> 33:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The World Health Organization
classifies things into their
risk categories based upon the

33:04.349 --> 33:10.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level of evidence, and not upon
the magnitude of risk. So while
it may be in the same category

33:10.922 --> 33:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as cigarette smoking, the
magnitude of the risk associated
with processed meats doesn't

33:16.094 --> 33:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly compare to the magnitude
of risk that's been found with
cigarette smoking.

33:21.299 --> 33:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What that determination just
means is that there are numerous
studies that have found

33:25.570 --> 33:33.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
similar findings. The risk --
the relative risk for smoking is
much higher, and unlike

33:33.311 --> 33:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the consumption of meats, the
consumption of excess cigarettes
or tobacco doesn't provide

33:37.883 --> 33:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any nutritional benefits.

33:39.050 --> 33:42.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I see.

33:42.254 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How comfortable are you with the
strength of this science? I
mean, the industry and

33:46.825 --> 33:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some other scientists have said
that the WHO might be
overstating the case a little
bit.

33:52.030 --> 33:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How strong do you feel that this
is really a concern we all ought
to be worried about?

33:56.001 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JONATHAN SCHOENFELD: Yes, I
think it's important to
understand the strengths and

33:59.137 --> 34:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
limitation of this type of study
and this type of recommendation.

34:03.642 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think we can have more
confidence in the results
because the methodology that is
used

34:09.714 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is looking at not one study by
itself, but the aggregate
findings of many and, indeed,

34:15.553 --> 34:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of studies. But it's
important to realize that the
magnitude of the effects

34:20.191 --> 34:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the absolute increase in
risk with the excess consumption
of processed meats, of

34:26.231 --> 34:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
red meat, is actually relatively
small, especially with other
things that we can modify in our

34:30.635 --> 34:34.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lifestyle and diet, such
as cigarette smoking.

34:34.506 --> 34:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, I think it's
reasonable to be mindful of
these findings, but I don't
think

34:40.979 --> 34:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it should warrant an
overall change in people's
lifestyles at this point.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.
Jonathan Schoenfeld of Harvard
Medical School, thank

34:48.920 --> 34:50.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

34:50.255 --> 34:58.296 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
DR. JONATHAN
SCHOENFELD: Thank you.

34:58.296 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The presidential
candidates are working overtime,
from a big Democratic
fund-raising

35:13.311 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dinner in Iowa featuring the
newly shrunken field of Hillary
Clinton, Bernie Sanders and

35:19.851 --> 35:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin O'Malley, to fresh jabs
and counterjabs on the
Republican side, as
front-runners Donald

35:24.856 --> 35:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump and Ben Carson begin
to take aim at each other.

35:28.326 --> 35:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: Ben Carson is a very
low-energy person. Actually,

35:28.727 --> 35:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Ben Carson is lower
energy than Jeb, if you want to
know the truth. We need strong

35:27.859 --> 35:29.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
energy.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: I don't get into the
mud pit, and I'm not going

35:30.028 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be talking about people. I
will tell you, in terms of
energy, I'm not sure that
there's

35:29.627 --> 35:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anybody else running who's spent
18 or 20 hours intently
operating on somebody.

35:29.761 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And last night, Vice
President Joe Biden told "60
Minutes" that the only

35:33.231 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reason he didn't run for
president is that he could not
win.

35:36.901 --> 35:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: You wouldn't have
considered running for president
unless you thought or had some

35:36.101 --> 35:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doubts about Hillary Clinton.

35:37.268 --> 35:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: Not at all.
That has nothing to do

35:37.736 --> 35:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with it. I have said from the
beginning, look, I like Hillary.
Hillary and I get along
together.

35:37.936 --> 35:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only reason to run is
because I -- I still think I
could do a better job than
anybody

35:36.801 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
else could do.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So what better time
for Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter

35:41.272 --> 35:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report?

35:43.875 --> 35:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start by talking about
Donald Trump and Ben Carson,
who, it appears, are now about

35:49.414 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go after each other because
-- and let's take a look at the
poll numbers, which explains

35:53.551 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why -- all of a sudden, they're
tied -- or I should say Ben
Carson is surging in Iowa.

35:58.757 --> 36:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The latest Des Moines Register
poll has him at 28 percent,
Donald Trump at 19 percent.

36:03.428 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in New Hampshire, the latest
CBS poll has him at -- has
Donald Trump at 38 percent

36:07.532 --> 36:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Carson at 12 percent.

36:10.735 --> 36:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, Amy, when he's
asked about these polls -- he
likes to talk about polls.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: He loves talking about
the polls.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He now thinks that
the polls, especially the one in
Iowa, where he's trailing,

36:16.941 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might be wrong.

36:18.843 --> 36:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, of course,
because how could he possibly
not be in first place?

36:22.814 --> 36:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think we are now at sort
of the new stage here in this
campaign, where we know

36:27.552 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we still have a very strong
group of Republican primary
voters looking for an outsider.
They

36:34.325 --> 36:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liked Trump earlier this summer.
As we have moved on into the
fall, you can already start

36:39.631 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to feel that he may have,
reality show lingo here, jumped
the shark a little bit. Here's

36:44.269 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
starting to wear a
little bit thin.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: I have heard
this before, Amy.

36:47.705 --> 36:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I know. Hey, listen,
here's what I will say to you.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

36:51.743 --> 36:57.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: This isn't
indicative of everything, but
sitting in -- both looking at
data from

36:57.415 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Iowa, listening to some
Republican voters in a focus
group last week, they still like

37:02.921 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

37:05.023 --> 37:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's be very clear. He still
has a very important place in
this primary field. But what you

37:11.362 --> 37:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can start to hear from voters,
from Republican primary voters,
is, I don't know about the

37:16.401 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperament. I don't know if I
trust him in that job, hence the
rise of Ben Carson, who

37:21.406 --> 37:23.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the exact opposite
in temperament.

37:23.842 --> 37:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about Ben
Carson's temperament. Very calm.
He will admit to you

37:28.213 --> 37:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is a very calm person, which,
of course, is what Donald Trump
was talking about. But

37:31.749 --> 37:35.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he said some very strong
things this weekend.

37:35.520 --> 37:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that abortion is like
slavery. He has been very
definitive in his conservative

37:41.826 --> 37:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
views. Do people like him? I
mean, what explains, I guess,
the surge in Iowa?

37:46.798 --> 37:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: I think that a lot of
people who you talk to about

37:50.268 --> 37:57.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
why they like Ben Carson
actually like that he's quiet,
that he's not this bomb thrower,

37:57.542 --> 38:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though the interesting thing is
that a lot of the things he
says, some of the analogies

38:01.012 --> 38:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he makes to Nazism and some
other things are pretty
inflammatory, but he says it
very quietly.

38:06.951 --> 38:07.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:07.252 --> 38:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... analogies.

38:08.753 --> 38:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Sort of a doctor
voice, yes. And there have been
some numbers out there

38:12.257 --> 38:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
showing that people agree
with what he's saying.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Republican
primary voters.

38:15.560 --> 38:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, Republicans.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

38:17.662 --> 38:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And we're talking
about Republican primary voters.
We're also talking in Iowa

38:21.332 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a state that is heavily
evangelical in the primary. And
he is appealing to that

38:29.908 --> 38:32.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of very -- he's a
very religious person.

38:32.677 --> 38:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about Jeb
Bush, because the last time
Donald Trump accused someone

38:36.414 --> 38:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of being low-energy, it kind of
worked. And Donald Trump and Jeb
Bush have seen the altitude

38:40.585 --> 38:43.688 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
going out of his
balloon ever since.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is he pulling back or he is
just reorganizing himself?

38:47.358 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It is remarkable, I
think, in this race, not so much
that there is an outsider

38:54.032 --> 38:57.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
energy fueling these two
candidates, Carson and Trump.

38:57.969 --> 39:02.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What I think is the most
remarkable thing on the
Republican side is the vacuum on
the

39:02.006 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called establishment side,
that no candidate -- we thought
it was going to be Jeb Bush.

39:06.844 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He hasn't lived up to
expectations, and no one else
has been able to sort of get in
that

39:12.283 --> 39:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lane as the front-runner on the
establishment side to match up
against the front-runner

39:17.355 --> 39:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the non-establishment side.

39:19.924 --> 39:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Jeb Bush, apparently, they
spent the weekend in Houston
with big donors trying to assure

39:24.262 --> 39:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them that everything is fine,
we got this all under control.

39:28.366 --> 39:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's really clear that the
problem for Jeb Bush is, one, he
hasn't been a particularly

39:33.137 --> 39:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong candidate, and, number
two, he has a message that is
not the right message for

39:39.210 --> 39:44.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this moment. He is an
establishment candidate who is
talking about his record and his
accomplishments

39:44.382 --> 39:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as governor, when Republican
primary voters want an outsider
and somebody who is going

39:46.618 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to shake up the system.

39:48.786 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, obviously, there
are other Republicans who see an
opportunity here, among

39:52.490 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them, say, Ted Cruz
or Marco Rubio.

39:55.460 --> 39:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And Ted Cruz
and Marco Rubio are going for
sort of different people.

39:59.030 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the betting markets,
Marco Rubio is on the rise.
Marco Rubio in these markets

40:05.136 --> 40:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people who sort of look at
the odds in a sort of outsider
way, his stock has risen.

40:11.476 --> 40:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now higher than Jeb Bush.
And he has been building an
organization, the same thing

40:17.348 --> 40:24.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very much true with Ted Cruz,
who has an organization. He has
people text in.

40:24.689 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he even has an app. He is
very serious about building an
organization. And as things

40:30.928 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start to settle out and -- his
plan is, as things settle out
and Donald Trump loses some

40:36.134 --> 40:37.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that...

40:37.302 --> 40:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Those same people.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: ... those
people will go to Ted Cruz.

40:40.738 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: To Ted Cruz.

40:42.707 --> 40:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about the Democrats,
a big weekend. Do you remember,
in 2007, Barack Obama went

40:46.644 --> 40:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Jefferson Jackson Day
Dinner in Des Moines, broke out,
and next thing you know

40:50.882 --> 40:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he had overwhelmed Hillary
Clinton and won Iowa?

40:53.551 --> 40:54.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did anybody break
out this weekend?

40:54.686 --> 40:55.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: No.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: No. No,
this was not...

40:57.355 --> 40:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: This is not 2007.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: This was not 2007.

41:01.059 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There wasn't a breakout. But,
listen, there was a change. And
you saw in Bernie Sanders

41:05.563 --> 41:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that night on Saturday night in
Des Moines a more pointed
criticism of Hillary Clinton

41:11.002 --> 41:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than we have seen before.
Now, he didn't use her name.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which you're not
allowed to, I think, at this
dinner.

41:15.206 --> 41:15.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's
probably true.

41:15.707 --> 41:16.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:16.741 --> 41:19.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: So, it was
still a -- it was subtle.

41:19.110 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what he was saying, what his
message is, not only I am the
candidate that is talking

41:23.214 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about income inequality and
making that the centerpiece of
my campaign, but I was there

41:27.452 --> 41:32.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first on issues that are
important to progressives, and I
have been there when it's not
convenient,

41:32.924 --> 41:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq, Defense of Marriage
Act and on trade.

41:36.027 --> 41:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Hillary Clinton
responded, following him, by
throwing her arms around

41:39.464 --> 41:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barack Obama and saying, I'm
the Democrat's Democrat.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

41:43.835 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She -- and she had people there
with thunder sticks, and she --
she learned her lesson

41:49.707 --> 41:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 2007, which was Barack
Obama basically out-organized
her and put on a better show,

41:53.711 --> 41:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she wasn't going to go into
that without putting on quite a
show.

41:58.716 --> 42:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a sea of blue glow
sticks for Hillary Clinton. She
did make one remark that was

42:03.855 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like a little dig at Bernie
Sanders, where she said, you
know, people say I'm shouting

42:08.593 --> 42:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too much on guns, which is
actually an issue that's sort of
the toughest issue for Bernie.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you know, people often
think women are shouting. It was
sort of a...

42:16.367 --> 42:18.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Lots of
gender references.

42:18.803 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, there was a
lot. She is -- Hillary Clinton
is definitely running as

42:22.273 --> 42:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a woman in a way that she
didn't last time around.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let's
talk about Joe Biden.

42:26.611 --> 42:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We watched him last night on "60
Minutes." He gave another one of
those emotional interviews.

42:30.715 --> 42:35.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also said some pretty
interesting things about why he
chose not to run, in particular

42:35.686 --> 42:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his assessment of and Jill --
Dr. Jill Biden's assessment of
Hillary Clinton.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

42:41.659 --> 42:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, I think what he said,
quite simply, "I didn't think I
could win," although the

42:47.899 --> 42:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biggest thing I took out from
this interview was, this was
much more of an emotional than

42:53.204 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a logical decision. This wasn't
about campaign finance, as much
as it was about a grieving

42:57.642 --> 42:59.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
father. And, look...

42:59.644 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He talked about his
granddaughter saying, "Pop,
don't go away."

43:03.815 --> 43:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, tearing up
while -- you had to tear up when
you listened to him talk

43:06.417 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that.

43:08.820 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was really clear that, no
matter -- if he wanted to do
this, and it's that he was

43:15.059 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running against a calendar that
wasn't going to help him, new
filing deadlines were coming,

43:20.832 --> 43:25.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raising was going to be
very difficult. And,
fundamentally, in order to beat
Hillary

43:25.536 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, he was going to have to
take the case to Hillary
Clinton. She wasn't just going

43:27.605 --> 43:30.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to collapse.

43:30.107 --> 43:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you hear people around
Joe Biden, they talk about him,
they say he was never

43:33.811 --> 43:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be that candidate who
was going to directly at her.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.716 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: What
struck you the most?

43:38.716 --> 43:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, that moment
that you talked about, too. It
was just -- it was so emotional.

43:44.222 --> 43:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, I think that he was
watching the reports, that he
was paying attention to what

43:51.229 --> 43:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we were saying about whether
he was going to run or not.

43:53.431 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:54.999 --> 43:57.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He was annoyed by
it. And he thought, they're all
getting it wrong, because,

43:57.935 --> 44:00.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently, he hadn't
made up his mind.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And so he decided to
get it right. It was a very
effective and interesting way

44:02.373 --> 44:02.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it.

44:02.907 --> 44:04.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

44:04.141 --> 44:07.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, thank you all.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:08.479 --> 44:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Go have some meat.

44:13.885 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:14.919 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

44:19.390 --> 44:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, a
story of a historic flood and
bringing together ancient

44:24.862 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
craft and modern science
to restore masterworks.

44:29.634 --> 44:35.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown reports from
Florence, Italy, for his ongoing
series Culture at Risk.

44:35.773 --> 44:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An artwork
brought back to life after
nearly 50 years. This is one of

44:44.015 --> 44:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five wood panels comprising
Giorgio Vasari's Last Supper, a
massive painting, some
21-feet-long

44:50.755 --> 44:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in all, first completed in 1546,
and now, after many thought it
impossible, approaching

44:55.960 --> 44:58.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a complete restoration.

44:58.396 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA FROSININI, Opificio
delle Pietre Dure: This is
probably the only place where
you

45:02.066 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can expect a miracle.

45:05.202 --> 45:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cecilia Frosinini
is overseeing the reconstruction
of The Last Supper at the

45:11.008 --> 45:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opificio delle Pietre Dure, the
OPD, in Florence, Italy, one of
the world's foremost institutes

45:17.481 --> 45:23.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of art preservation and
restoration and a place itself
forged by tragedy.

45:23.254 --> 45:28.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to imagine today, but,
in 1966, this famous piazza and
much of Florence was

45:28.993 --> 45:32.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
underwater, with devastating
consequences for the art
treasures for which this city

45:32.363 --> 45:33.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is so renowned.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.734 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
NARRATOR: It all
started suddenly.

45:36.734 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: November 1966,
days of rain swelled the Arno
River, sending water, oil

45:43.741 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sediment into Florence, in
the city's worst flood in nearly
400 years. It was captured

45:54.051 --> 45:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this documentary by filmmaker
Franco Zeffirelli, narrated by
actor Richard Burton and
broadcast

45:58.923 --> 46:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Italian state television.

46:01.926 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 30 people died and
thousands of priceless works of
art and manuscripts were

46:08.165 --> 46:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damaged or destroyed. The
disaster inspired an outpouring
of support from around the
world,

46:14.005 --> 46:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enlisting donations and young
volunteers, known as Mud Angels,
to descend upon the city

46:18.576 --> 46:21.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help clean up the mess.

46:21.012 --> 46:24.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUDOVICA SEBREGONDI, Art
Historian, Santa Croce Church
(through translator): Here, the

46:24.815 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water reached nearly 20 feet. It
was so shocking. And with the
water came damage. It moved
everything

46:28.719 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everywhere.

46:30.821 --> 46:36.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ludovica
Sebregondi is an art historian
at the Santa Croce Church, which

46:36.360 --> 46:41.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sits just a few blocks from the
river. Parts of the church and
its famed museum were completely

46:41.999 --> 46:46.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
submerged, including where
Vasari's Last Supper hung. It
remained underwater for more
than

46:46.003 --> 46:49.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
48 hours.

46:49.407 --> 46:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another victim, a huge crucifix
by Cimabue completed in the 13th
century, its paint almost

46:55.446 --> 47:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
completely washed away by the
waters. The damaged crucifix has
returned, as have many

47:01.352 --> 47:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other works, this time to the
museum's higher ground, in case
the waters should return.

47:06.691 --> 47:10.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUDOVICA SEBREGONDI (through
translator): Many of the
artworks have been restored in

47:10.227 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these 50 years, but one has yet
to be returned. The most famous
of all is The Last Supper

47:14.331 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by Vasari. It's a
symbol of the flood.

47:18.035 --> 47:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A symbol because
of its size and the extent of
its damage. After the waters

47:23.641 --> 47:28.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
receded, Vasari's work was
covered with sheets of fine
paper, in an emergency measure
to

47:28.879 --> 47:33.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
prevent the paint from
separating from the wood. That
bought time, but for more than

47:33.651 --> 47:37.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
40 years, few believed it
could be saved in one piece.

47:37.321 --> 47:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CECILIA FROSININI: Many of the
old restorers advised that,
basing on their experience,

47:42.126 --> 47:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
based on their experience, the
only possible way was to destroy
the wood or at least to

47:47.131 --> 47:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to preserve the wood,
but to separate in two.

47:52.169 --> 47:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A decision was
made to wait, until new
restoration methods gave OPD
officials

47:57.208 --> 48:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence they could preserve
it in its original form.

48:01.412 --> 48:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in 2009, the work began.
The OPD, whose name translates
to the Workshop of Semi-Precious

48:09.520 --> 48:16.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stones, has a storied history
itself. Dating to the 16th
century under the Medici family,

48:16.260 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it produced the finest inlaid
mosaic and stonework, using
techniques that can still be
found at

48:21.198 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its museum workshop
in Florence today.

48:24.001 --> 48:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 20th century, it turned
to conservation, and, expanding
into a Renaissance-era fort

48:30.007 --> 48:34.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after the 1966 flood, it
dramatically broadened its
mission and scope.

48:34.812 --> 48:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPD director Marco Ciatti:

48:37.815 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO CIATTI, Director, Opificio
delle Pietre Dure: We needed new
techniques. Mainly, the

48:42.219 --> 48:46.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flood was the starting point
with the new relationship with
science.

48:46.590 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Around every
corner, a work by one master or
another, a Botticelli sitting

48:52.062 --> 48:58.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on an easel, Leonardo da Vinci's
Adoration of the Magi, usually
in Florence's Uffizi

48:58.402 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Museum, awaiting a cleaning, and
more recent works, an early
Jackson Pollock that's just

49:04.408 --> 49:09.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arrived. It's part museum, part
workshop, part hospital for
threatened treasures.

49:09.580 --> 49:13.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TON WILMERING, Getty Foundation:
The dark areas are less dense,
so that's where paint

49:13.884 --> 49:17.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been lost, and you can very
clearly see the splits between
the planks.

49:17.888 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ton Wilmering, an
expert in wood restoration,
showed me a large X-ray

49:23.160 --> 49:28.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
image of part of the Vasari.
Wilmering is with the Getty
Foundation, which helped fund

49:28.899 --> 49:31.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Vasari project.

49:31.836 --> 49:35.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the record, the Getty Trust
supports the "NewsHour"'s arts
coverage.

49:35.406 --> 49:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TON WILMERING: And when the
water receded, it pulled some of
the paint, it pulled some

49:39.210 --> 49:42.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the gesso, which is the layer
in between the wood panel and
the paint, to the bottom.

49:42.479 --> 49:43.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

49:43.981 --> 49:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
painting literally sort of
falls?

49:45.683 --> 49:46.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:46.250 --> 49:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TON WILMERING: Sags, exactly.

49:47.785 --> 49:51.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It
sags. I see. I see.

49:51.121 --> 49:54.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what are you doing here?
You're taking a picture of the
painting.

49:54.124 --> 49:57.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAFFAELLA FONTANA, Physicist:
Yes, we're trying to measure not
only the visible image of a

49:57.194 --> 50:01.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
painting, but also what is
beneath the paint layer.

50:01.832 --> 50:07.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Raffaella Fontana
is a physicist using
multispectrum scanning
techniques to

50:07.705 --> 50:12.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peer beneath the surface of
paintings, a noninvasive way to
create complex models of their
many

50:12.409 --> 50:14.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
layers.

50:14.478 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAFFAELLA FONTANA: And then
there are conservators and
restorers that pick up our data
and decide

50:19.783 --> 50:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how to work on a painting.

50:23.754 --> 50:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of those
restorers is Ciro Castelli using
knowledge and tools that date

50:29.260 --> 50:34.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
back further than the
Renaissance masterworks
themselves. He was a young
carpenter just

50:34.465 --> 50:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beginning his career when the
flood hit. He helped removed mud
and then began to work

50:38.235 --> 50:41.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with expert wood restorers.

50:41.305 --> 50:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIRO CASTELLI, Restorer (through
translator): To work on wood,
you need to know it. Knowing

50:45.209 --> 50:49.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how wood reacts is vital for
restoration. We can't restore a
painting if we don't know

50:49.346 --> 50:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about its structure. Woodcraft
spans more than centuries. It's
millennia.

50:53.584 --> 50:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Castelli came out
of retirement to work on the
Vasari paneling. And a key

50:58.923 --> 51:03.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goal of this project is that he
not only apply his special
knowledge to this individual
work,

51:03.727 --> 51:07.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but also train a new
generation of restorers.

51:07.698 --> 51:11.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CIRO CASTELLI (through
translator): Working with
younger people is a way to stay
young,

51:11.502 --> 51:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just as far as the spirit is
concerned, but in the activity
itself as well. Working

51:16.807 --> 51:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with younger people means
passing on our knowledge, which
benefits those of us who provide
the

51:19.710 --> 51:21.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
knowledge too.

51:21.679 --> 51:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is concern
here, amid Italy's continuing
economic troubles, about

51:26.884 --> 51:33.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funding to train and employ this
next generation. Still, as the
50th anniversary of Florence's

51:33.123 --> 51:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Great Flood approaches, Cecilia
Frosinini hopes to have the Last
Supper finished and

51:37.828 --> 51:41.365 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
returned to the
Santa Croce Museum.

51:41.365 --> 51:45.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CECILIA FROSININI: Giving back
this painting to the city is a
very important symbolic act.

51:45.035 --> 51:48.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you're
going to make it in time?

51:48.405 --> 51:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA FROSININI: We are
really, really going for this
deadline. I think we will make
it.

51:55.279 --> 51:59.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Florence,
Italy, I'm Jeffrey Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

51:59.850 --> 52:04.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can go behind
the scenes, even more online,
where you will find producer

52:04.221 --> 52:09.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Frank Carlson's photo essay on
the OPD and the Santa Croce
Museum.

52:09.126 --> 52:14.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, tomorrow, Jeff returns with
a second story of Culture at
Risk in Italy, this time

52:14.598 --> 52:30.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a dying hilltop town that's
coming back to life through
engineering and tourism.

52:30.247 --> 52:35.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online, we pay
tribute to "Joy of Painting"
master Bob Ross by trying

52:35.886 --> 52:42.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to imitate his happy trees in a
painting of our own. The late
PBS star's official YouTube

52:42.292 --> 52:47.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
channel released his very first
episode from 1983, and we
decided to try to follow along

52:47.931 --> 52:50.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with his master class.

52:50.701 --> 52:57.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The result -- you be the judge
-- is posted on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:57.975 --> 53:00.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And tune in later tonight, on
"Charlie Rose," for Democratic
presidential candidate Bernie

53:00.677 --> 53:02.946 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders.

53:02.946 --> 53:06.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:06.350 --> 53:10.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:10.354 --> 53:10.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
