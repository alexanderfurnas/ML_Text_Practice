HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
in Milwaukee

00:07.274 --> 00:09.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for tonight's Democratic debate.

00:09.476 --> 00:14.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: In a
pivotal moment,
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton face off,

00:14.448 --> 00:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first encounter since New
Hampshire's
results.

00:17.618 --> 00:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: in part two of our
Egypt series,
a look at their heavy handed
judiciary system.

00:22.956 --> 00:29.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF, Egyptian Activist:
They have
this crazy idea that you can
teach a whole

00:29.463 --> 00:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
population manners by putting
them in jail.

00:32.165 --> 00:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, Einstein
was right
again. After 50 years of
research, scientists

00:36.970 --> 00:43.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detect the sound of two black
holes colliding,
proof gravitational waves do
exist.

00:43.777 --> 00:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.616 --> 00:51.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.985 --> 01:02.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Milwaukee is
the center
of the Democratic political
universe tonight.

01:02.429 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates meet for a "PBS
NewsHour" presidential
debate, and how they perform on
stage could

01:07.801 --> 01:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
influence the next key contests.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our political director, Lisa
Desjardins, is
in Milwaukee.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

01:16.343 --> 01:19.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" staff is finishing up
the rehearsals
on our debate stage for what is
expected to

01:19.913 --> 01:24.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a powerful and maybe even
pivotal debate
between Bernie Sanders and
Hillary Clinton,

01:24.618 --> 01:29.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the Democrats do not have a
monopoly on
intensity. And, today,
Republicans were also

01:29.523 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting for votes in their next
primary state,
South Carolina.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
This is our youngest, Dominick.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Say hello, Dominick.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMINICK RUBIO, Son of Marco
Rubio: Hello.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All across the
Palmetto State,
the hopefuls are making tracks,
and taking

01:40.701 --> 01:42.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their best shots.

01:42.736 --> 01:50.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush
marked his
63rd birthday by stumping with
South Carolina

01:50.811 --> 01:54.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lindsey Graham and going
after front-runner
Donald Trump.

01:54.281 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Do you
want an entertainer- in-chief,
someone who

01:58.719 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will say whatever he wants to
make it all
about him, insult people, divide
people, basically

02:07.127 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just talk trash on his way to
the Republican
nomination? Or do you want
someone who has

02:12.332 --> 02:15.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been tested? Because, if you do,
I'm your
man.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Bush's fellow
Floridian,
Senator Marco Rubio, took a
different line

02:19.473 --> 02:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of attack today, near Hilton
Head.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Donald Trump
has zero foreign
policy experience. Negotiating a
hotel deal

02:25.612 --> 02:27.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in another country is not
foreign policy experience.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:29.216 --> 02:31.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Jeb Bush has
no foreign
experience, period.

02:31.485 --> 02:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rubio said he's
ready for
a long slog to the party's
nomination and

02:36.156 --> 02:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even a brokered Republican
Convention this
summer, likewise Ohio Governor
John Kasich,

02:41.261 --> 02:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who placed second in New
Hampshire. He told
CNN last night he doesn't expect
to win in

02:46.733 --> 02:50.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina. But he said
today he means
to keep campaigning.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
We are going to do our best
here. I'm a scrappy

02:52.773 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guy. And we are going to move
all across the
country.

02:56.109 --> 03:01.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Trump talked of
sweeping away his opponents at a
campaign

03:01.248 --> 03:02.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stop in Clemson last night.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We win here, we're going to run
the table.

03:05.485 --> 03:09.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we win here, after winning so
big in New
Hampshire, all of these
characters are going

03:10.090 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to give it up.

03:12.059 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: On the
Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders sized up the state of
the race on

03:16.596 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBS' "Late Show With Stephen
Colbert" last
night.

03:18.665 --> 03:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I think a lot of Donald Trump
supporters are

03:23.804 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
angry. People have a right to be
angry. But
what we need to be is rational
in figuring

03:29.743 --> 03:34.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out how we address the problems,
and not just
simply scapegoating minorities.

03:34.581 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rival Hillary
Clinton hopes
to draw on her strength with
minorities. She

03:39.886 --> 03:43.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
picked up a key endorsement
today from the
Congressional Black Caucus PAC.

03:43.557 --> 03:49.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND (D),
Louisiana: Our brains
and our intelligence tells us
what our conscience

03:49.429 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirms, that the best person
to be the next
president of the United States
is Hillary

03:54.734 --> 03:56.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rodham Clinton.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Georgia
Congressman and civil
rights veteran John Lewis went
further, questioning

04:00.006 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders' claim that he worked
for racial justice
in the 1960s.

04:03.343 --> 04:07.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), Georgia: I
never saw
him. I never met him.

04:07.414 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was involved in the sit-ins,
the Freedom
Ride, the March on Washington,
the march from

04:13.320 --> 04:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Selma to Montgomery and directed
the Voter
Education Project for six years.

04:19.126 --> 04:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I met Hillary Clinton. I met
President
Clinton.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Both Clinton
and Sanders
largely stayed out of sight
today, as they

04:27.667 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prepped for tonight's debate
here in Milwaukee.

04:30.137 --> 04:38.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa joins us
now, along
with Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report

04:38.812 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, I want to start with you.
How close
is this race heading into
tonight's debate?

04:43.783 --> 04:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a real
horse race.
It is not the race we thought it
was three

04:48.054 --> 04:49.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or four months ago.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has momentum, so
I don't want
to say that there's really a
front-runner

04:53.827 --> 04:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this point. Hillary Clinton
has more of
what are called superdelegates.
I know you

04:58.131 --> 05:02.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to talk about that, Amy.
But Bernie's
got momentum. So, we have a real
race. I don't

05:03.003 --> 05:05.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think -- I don't want to say
there is a front-runner
right now.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: We
have had a obviously very
contested contest

05:08.608 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iowa that Hillary narrowly
won. Bernie
came out of New Hampshire, big,
big win.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real question now, we head
to Nevada and
South Carolina, which are
demographically

05:18.051 --> 05:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very different, stylistically
very different.
This is what Hillary Clinton has
always thought

05:22.622 --> 05:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going to be her so-called
firewall, because
it's a much more diverse state,
not quite

05:27.060 --> 05:28.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as liberal as those other two.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why she needs to have a
strong debate
tonight going into what we will
soon see in

05:33.200 --> 05:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nevada and South Carolina.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Absolutely.

05:36.269 --> 05:41.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, you can tell how
important these
voters are, because -- and how
the landscape

05:41.274 --> 05:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has shifted, because Bernie
Sanders was announcing
an endorsement from Harry
Belafonte. Meanwhile,

05:47.113 --> 05:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has a number of
members of
the Congressional Black Caucus
holding a press

05:50.717 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference singing her praises.
This has definitely
shifted to the next states,
where the electorate...

05:56.389 --> 05:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The non-white
vote is more
important.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, where the
electorate reflects
the Democratic Party as a whole.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, let
me get to
that question.

06:04.097 --> 06:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara, I want to start with
you. So, who
do they need to appeal to
through this debate

06:08.868 --> 06:10.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond?

06:10.704 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's not -- it's
all of the
Democratic electorate, and I
think Hillary

06:15.475 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton especially has work to
do, at least
based on the exit polls that we
saw from New

06:19.679 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

06:20.914 --> 06:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lost -- she lost women. She
lost young
people.

06:26.753 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Almost every
age group.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Basically,
everybody.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Everybody, except
people earning
more than $200,000 a year.

06:31.791 --> 06:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she really needs to come
out on this
debate stage, and, as she said
Tuesday night,

06:36.263 --> 06:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she has work to do. She needs to
do that work
and needs to present herself as
more than

06:41.501 --> 06:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a resume and a pile of white
papers.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You know, young
people are something
that she is definitely going to
need to do

06:47.440 --> 06:49.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much better with.

06:49.342 --> 06:54.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was losing not just by the
margins she
lost to Obama, which were big,
but by 70 -- 70,

06:54.547 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
80 points. That is really
unprecedented. Her
challenge, I think, is a little
bit like a

07:01.221 --> 07:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parent at Christmas, when you
have to admit
that there is no Santa Claus,
but still keep

07:05.191 --> 07:06.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the magic of the holiday.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wait. There is
no Santa Claus?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I'm sorry that I
ruined it for
you.

07:10.797 --> 07:11.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:11.932 --> 07:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I will talk to
you afterwards.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But that's what
she's confronting
right now with younger people,
who are -- who

07:16.603 --> 07:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do want to be inspired, who see
Bernie Sanders
as aspirational.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's trying to say, yes, but
let's try to
figure out how we get things
done. How do

07:24.978 --> 07:30.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you do that in a way that
doesn't undermine
the real energy that the younger
voters have?

07:30.583 --> 07:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The pragmatic
vision that
she has, Hari, is not something
that young

07:32.886 --> 07:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are looking for. They're
looking for
big vision.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one small grain of hope, I
think, that
I saw out of New Hampshire -- I
don't know

07:38.391 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you guys saw this -- in the
exit polls,
she did win with people who
decided that day

07:42.195 --> 07:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the polls, just by a little
bit. So that
might give her the idea that
standing on this

07:45.732 --> 07:49.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stage tonight, Hari, maybe she
can turn around
some people who are on the fence
who are still

07:49.936 --> 07:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deciding. That's what she's
counting on.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Amy, I want to
ask -- start with you. What are
you looking

07:54.641 --> 07:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for from each of the candidates
tonight?

07:57.610 --> 08:03.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: From Hillary
Clinton's perspective,
it is this balance of Santa
Claus and spirit

08:03.316 --> 08:07.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the holiday that I was
discussing. But
it's also pressing Bernie
Sanders on specifics.

08:07.654 --> 08:13.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been able to talk about
this big, inspirational,
aspirational message, without
getting nailed

08:13.460 --> 08:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down on how that's actually
going to work.
How can she get him to specify
those things?

08:19.232 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also looking for her to
really hone in
on her message.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went back and I looked at all
the Hillary
Clinton ads that have been run
since the summer,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's kind of a mishmash.
There's a little
bit of everything here. You have
some guns.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have some pay equity. You
have talk about
work she did with children and
women.

08:32.612 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is her message? We know
what Bernie Sanders'
message is. It's all about the
economy being

08:36.716 --> 08:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rigged and Wall Street is not on
your side.
Where is Hillary Clinton going
to find that

08:41.721 --> 08:43.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
message?

08:43.757 --> 08:47.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I think, for
Bernie Sanders,
it's really about, can he get
beyond the talking

08:47.594 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points, beyond the slogans, and
can he, you
know, dig in on foreign policy,
beyond saying,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I voted against the Iraq War, I
have got the
judgment?

08:55.902 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the -- on health care, on
some of these
other things, can he really get
into the weeds

09:00.373 --> 09:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with it? And I think Hillary
Clinton is going
to try to press him to do that.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, Hari, I
think our viewers
should know that, in organizing
this debate,

09:07.847 --> 09:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know the thing that Gwen and
Judy really
care about the most is, they
want to try and

09:11.418 --> 09:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show the differences between
these two candidates.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're similar in a lot of
ways, but they
are really hoping to focus on
issues and substance

09:16.389 --> 09:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight and drill down on, what
kind of a
different president would each
of them make?

09:21.294 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we will see.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins,
our political director, Amy
Walter from the

09:25.064 --> 09:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook Political Report, and
Tamara Keith from
NPR, thanks so much.

09:29.169 --> 09:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
federal judge ordered
that all of Hillary Clinton's
remaining e-mails

09:34.307 --> 09:38.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as secretary of state be
released this month.
They were to have been released
by the end

09:38.511 --> 09:42.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of January, but the State
Department asked
for an extension. Clinton's use
of a private

09:42.649 --> 09:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail server during her time at
State has
dogged her presidential campaign
and triggered

09:47.654 --> 09:49.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an FBI investigation.

09:49.856 --> 09:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last four occupiers of a
national wildlife
refuge in Oregon surrendered
today, after

09:54.828 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a six-week standoff. With that,
law enforcement
pulled back after tense hours of
negotiations,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and local people welcomed the
outcome.

10:03.336 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I just posted
"Hallelujah" on my Facebook
post, and I think that says it
all. I am so

10:10.977 --> 10:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glad this is over. I have lived
in Eastern
Oregon or Northern Nevada my
entire life.

10:17.550 --> 10:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have never, ever in 70
years locked
the doors to my house until this
happened.

10:25.091 --> 10:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Authorities
also arrested
Cliven Bundy yesterday on
charges from a confrontation

10:29.562 --> 10:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Nevada. His son Ammon led the
Oregon standoff
before being arrested himself.

10:35.235 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A battle erupted at a prison in
Northern Mexico
overnight, and when it was over,
52 inmates

10:41.207 --> 10:46.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were dead. Officials in
Monterrey said the
fighting pitted factions linked
to rival drug

10:46.179 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cartels. TV broadcasts showed
part of the
facility burning as crowds of
inmates' relatives

10:52.318 --> 10:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gathered outside. They demanded
information
from police.

10:55.588 --> 11:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope Francis arrives in Mexico
tomorrow, and
will visit a prison in a nearby
state next

11:00.426 --> 11:02.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO defense chiefs ordered
three warships
to the Aegean Sea today to crack
down on gangs

11:06.399 --> 11:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smuggling refugees. After a
meeting in Brussels,
the alliance's secretary-general
said the

11:10.770 --> 11:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ships will assist the Turkish
and Greek coast
guards.

11:13.840 --> 11:18.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General:
This is not about stopping or
pushing back

11:18.878 --> 11:27.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
refugee boats. NATO will
contribute critical
information and surveillance to
help counter

11:27.820 --> 11:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human trafficking and criminal
networks.

11:30.423 --> 11:35.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: An estimated
76,000 migrants
have reached Europe by sea since
January 1,

11:36.029 --> 11:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
10 times more than the same
period last year.

11:39.666 --> 11:43.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Major powers opened their latest
talks today
on Syria, where a government
offensive and

11:43.770 --> 11:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian airstrikes are creating
thousands
of new refugees. Secretary of
State John Kerry

11:49.208 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
met with Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov.
But there was little sign that
the Russians

11:53.379 --> 11:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will agree to an immediate halt
in their bombing
campaign.

11:57.116 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, more than
40 Georgia
prison guards have been indicted
on federal

12:01.287 --> 12:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges of drug trafficking and
taking bribes.
The charges, spelled out today,
are the latest

12:06.893 --> 12:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a series of indictments since
September.

12:09.896 --> 12:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a former Los Angeles sheriff
now admits
he lied to federal investigators
in a probe

12:15.001 --> 12:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of jail corruption and prisoner
abuse. Lee
Baca pleaded guilty late
Wednesday to knowing

12:20.073 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about efforts to obstruct the
investigation.
To date, 17 members of the
sheriff's department

12:25.411 --> 12:27.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been convicted.

12:27.380 --> 12:32.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The mayor of Cleveland
apologized today, after
the city billed the estate of
Tamir Rice for

12:32.385 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ambulance services. The
12-year-old boy had
been playing with a pellet gun
when he was

12:36.389 --> 12:38.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed by police in 2014.

12:38.391 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Frank Jackson says it was
a mistake
to send the ambulance invoice,
even though

12:43.062 --> 12:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the estate's executor asked for
it.

12:45.331 --> 12:50.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANK JACKSON, Mayor of
Cleveland: Should
it have happened? No, because a
red flag should

12:50.169 --> 12:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been risen. But that didn't
happen. Did
-- was there -- did anybody do
anything wrong

12:57.310 --> 13:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this? No, because it's the
normal process.
It's the way in which we do
things internally.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also what the law
requires you to
do.

13:07.453 --> 13:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A Rice family
attorney called
the claim filing deeply
disturbing.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that utility crews
have finally
plugged a natural gas leak near
Los Angeles.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leak started nearly four
months ago, and
drove thousands of people from
their homes.

13:20.433 --> 13:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will be allowed back once
state inspectors
declare the well permanently
sealed.

13:25.938 --> 13:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has made his
choice for secretary
of education. He's Dr. John B.
King Jr., and

13:30.610 --> 13:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been acting secretary since
Arne Duncan
stepped down in December. He's
also served

13:35.248 --> 13:38.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as state commissioner of
education in New
York.

13:38.618 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street took another beating
over worries
about global growth. The Dow
Jones industrial

13:43.022 --> 13:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost more than 250
points to close
at 15660. The Nasdaq fell 16
points, and the

13:49.729 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 dropped 22.

13:53.199 --> 13:57.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the Senate gave final
approval today to
blocking state and local
governments from

13:58.004 --> 14:03.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taxing Internet access
permanently. Seven
states now collect such taxes,
but under this

14:03.810 --> 14:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
measure, they will have to stop
by 2020.

14:06.946 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the fight
for freedom of speech five years
after Egypt's

14:12.485 --> 14:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revolution; proof of Einstein's
universe-changing
theory on gravitational waves;
the first puppies

14:19.158 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
created using in vitro
fertilization; and
much more.

14:35.174 --> 14:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five years ago today, Egypt's
longtime ruler,
Hosni Mubarak, was removed from
power. And

14:39.445 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was soon jailed by Egypt's
judicial system.

14:42.615 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he is held in a military
hospital,
charged with ordering the
killings of protesters

14:47.520 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and awaiting retrial. The court
system in
Egypt has played an essential
role in the

14:51.724 --> 14:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turbulent times that followed
Mubarak's ouster.
The elected president after
Mubarak, Mohammed

Morsi, who was deposed by the
army, sits in
prison today, sentenced to
death.

15:02.402 --> 15:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under current President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi,
the courts have jailed tens of
thousands of

15:07.173 --> 15:11.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposition figures. He claims
the decisions
are out of his hands.

Tonight, special correspondent
Nick Schifrin
examines the role of the justice
system in

15:15.314 --> 15:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Egyptian society for our series
5 Years On.

15:19.118 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: No Egyptian
family has fought
for justice more tirelessly than
the Seifs.

15:26.092 --> 15:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alaa Abdel Fattah is a symbol of
the revolution,
imprisoned by the current
government. His

15:31.631 --> 15:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sister Mona Seif leads campaigns
against military
trials of civilians. And last
month, Sanaa

15:37.503 --> 15:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seif, the youngest daughter, was
the only
left-wing demonstrator to
commemorate the

15:41.674 --> 15:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arab Spring's fifth revolution.
Her jackets
reads, "The January 25

LAILA SOUEIF, Egyptian Activist:
The justice
apparatus is completely failed
at the moment.

15:54.687 --> 16:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Their mother is
Laila Soueif,
one of Egypt's most prominent
activists. That's

16:00.326 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her on the right yelling at
plainclothes police.
She has protested against six
governments

16:05.464 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over 42 years.

16:07.166 --> 16:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: It's my duty to do
this, so
that at least everyone remembers
that they

16:12.538 --> 16:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not have the right to push
people around.

16:15.074 --> 16:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Their father,
Ahmed Seif, was
Egypt's leading human rights
lawyer. Today,

16:20.046 --> 16:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Laila believes the judiciary is
out of control.

16:22.615 --> 16:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: That they have
this crazy idea
that you can teach a whole
population manners

16:30.323 --> 16:32.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by putting them in jail.

16:32.191 --> 16:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A judge sentenced
Alaa to five
years in prison for protesting
against what

16:35.628 --> 16:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he saw as the military taking
over the courts.
Sanaa was sentenced to three
years for protesting

16:41.534 --> 16:44.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against a law that bans
protests.

16:44.570 --> 16:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mona has been detained, and is
currently awaiting
a suspended sentence.

16:48.107 --> 16:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONA SEIF, Egyptian Activist:
The judges have
become self-motivated to squash
opposition

16:53.479 --> 16:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement and to imprison any
rebelling youth
that they don't think are
accommodating to

16:58.751 --> 17:00.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the conservative ideas.

17:00.620 --> 17:06.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Those
conservative, to the
point of iron-fist ideas are
embodied by the

17:06.726 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man they call the executioner
judge, Nagy
Shehata. Last January he
ratified a mass death

17:12.231 --> 17:17.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sentence of 183 suspects,
despite evidence
they'd been tortured.

17:17.403 --> 17:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sentenced 230 people at once
to life in
prison, even though police
killed many of

17:22.842 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the demonstrators.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAGY SHEHATA, Judge (through
translator):
I confirm, execution for the
crimes they are

17:28.147 --> 17:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accused of. And the accused are
obliged to
pay the trial fees. The session
is adjourned.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And when activist
Ahmed Douma
asked Shehata about his personal
Facebook

17:37.056 --> 17:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page, the judge added three
years to his sentence.

17:40.426 --> 17:48.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: This is just
sloppy work. And
when you're a judge, sloppy work
is a crime.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It wasn't always
like this.

17:52.505 --> 17:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the revolution, Egyptians
took pride
in their judiciary as fiercely
independent.

17:57.643 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, judges and their
defenders say the
judiciary is still independent,
but focused

18:02.982 --> 18:05.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on one specific thing:
maintaining peace and
security.

18:05.952 --> 18:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID RISLEY, Former Legal
Adviser to U.S.
Embassy: And the judiciary value
order and

18:10.523 --> 18:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public safety almost above
everything else.

18:13.192 --> 18:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For four years
David Risley
was the U.S. legal adviser and
diplomatic

18:17.396 --> 18:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attache to Egypt's judiciary. He
believes
Egyptian judges see violence on
the streets

18:22.802 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and believe their job is to
restore stability.

18:25.271 --> 18:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID RISLEY: Some judges simply
felt that
they are doing what needed to be
done for

18:30.476 --> 18:33.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the good of the country,
judicious or not.

18:33.779 --> 18:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: "PBS NewsHour"
called dozens
of Egyptian judges. Each
declined to be interviewed.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Western diplomats say the
judges, in private,
argue that Egyptians are willing
to give up

18:43.956 --> 18:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some rights to keep order. But
the Seifs argue,
even if that's true, today's
judges fail to

18:51.163 --> 18:52.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deliver.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONA SEIF: They have had their
100 percent
freedom to do whatever they want
to do for

18:57.136 --> 19:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the past two years. And order
has not returned.
Justice has not prevailed.

19:01.674 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: You do not bring
security or
stability by being
unprofessional. You bring

19:08.214 --> 19:13.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security and stability by
behaving like the
judge who sentenced my husband.
That -- that

19:13.319 --> 19:15.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is bringing security and
stability.

19:15.187 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: When Ahmed Seif
was arrested
in 1983, his judge investigated
whether he

19:19.992 --> 19:21.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had been tortured.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: And he threw out
the evidence
that was obtained by torture.
There was a

19:25.331 --> 19:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain amount of adherence to
the law.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And now?

19:30.069 --> 19:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: Now? Now you have
judges who
are not just unprofessional.
They're ignorant.

19:35.941 --> 19:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't know the -- they
don't know the
statues of the law.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But just like in
the U.S.,
Egypt's higher courts can
overrule lower courts'

19:45.785 --> 19:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harsh sentences. And that is
exactly what
has happened.

19:48.854 --> 19:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID RISLEY: On appeal, these
sorts of injudicious
mass convictions, mass death
penalties are

19:56.128 --> 20:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being consistently reversed,
that it makes
one wonder whether the real
purpose in these

20:02.301 --> 20:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mass convictions is not so much
to -- an expectation
that the defendants who are
convicted will

20:09.375 --> 20:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimately be punished, but
rather that they
are tied up and detained for an
extended period

20:15.181 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of time.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mona fights those
lengthy detentions.
She and other activists attempt
to document

20:21.020 --> 20:26.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Egypt's 40,000 political
prisoners. They're
trying to shine a light on a
system they call

20:26.459 --> 20:28.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a black box.

20:28.360 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MONA SEIF: You can have a
first-degree relative
who is now detained, faces
prosecution, and

20:34.166 --> 20:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets sentences, and you can't --
and you don't
even know. And you don't even
check on him

20:38.104 --> 20:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or get a lawyer to attend with
him.

20:39.438 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Because no one
has access to...

20:41.006 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MONA SEIF: Because no one has
access to it.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The Seifs have
been willing
to put everything into the
cause, their children

20:47.346 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their health, their freedom. The
two parents
and three children have been to
jail a combined

20:52.952 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10 times. It hasn't been easy.

20:55.154 --> 21:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ahmed died when Alaa and Sanaa
were both in
prison. The campaign to release
them was titled

21:00.926 --> 21:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Injustice Has Taken Them Away
From Us.

21:04.597 --> 21:11.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it like to have two of
your children
in prison? Then how can you even
handle that?

21:11.403 --> 21:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: You just turn it
into practicalities.
You get through a day at a time.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Because if you
didn't?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: And I don't know
how you would
live.

21:23.082 --> 21:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bright spot? Laila's first
grandson, Alaa's
son, 4-year-old Khalid (ph). His
toys fill

21:29.088 --> 21:30.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her living room.

21:31.023 --> 21:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAILA SOUEIF: That's about the
only thing
that consistently -- that makes
me consistently

21:35.895 --> 21:37.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happy at the moment.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Is your grandson.

21:39.532 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laila shows me her favorite
family photos.
In one, Khalid is laughing with
his mother.

21:44.103 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His father, above them, is
actually just a
poster. Khalid was born when
Alaa was in prison.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mona was born when her father
was in prison.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite all of the sacrifices
your family
has made, it's been worth it?

21:57.616 --> 22:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says it will be worth it if
their sacrifices
today mean her grandson doesn't
have to fight

22:02.154 --> 22:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same battles or go to the
same jails tomorrow.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick Schifrin, "PBS NewsHour,"
Cairo.

22:09.428 --> 22:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in
tomorrow night for
Nick's final piece on the role
of women in

22:14.066 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tumultuous five years since
the revolution.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now some truly cosmic news.

22:32.017 --> 22:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sound of two black holes
colliding more
than a billion years ago, it was
recorded

22:37.456 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a team of scientists at the
LIGO Observatory,
proof of gravitational waves, or
ripples in

22:42.828 --> 22:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time and space, first theorized
by Albert
Einstein.

22:46.398 --> 22:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore this monumental
moment in physics
with Dave Reitze of Caltech,
executive director

22:50.336 --> 22:52.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the LIGO Laboratory.

22:52.338 --> 22:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that was a rudimentary
attempt at explaining
what a gravitational wave is.
But what are

22:56.909 --> 22:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they, and why is it such a big
deal to find
one?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID REITZE, California
Institute of Technology:
Actually, you did a pretty good
job.

23:00.913 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, gravitational waves are
fluctuations in
space-time. And any time you
have a mass,

23:07.086 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that has matter in it,
accelerating,
all right, it produces a
gravitational wave.

23:13.158 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
All right? And that's a
consequence of Einstein's
theory of general relativity.

23:17.696 --> 23:22.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, these particular
gravitational waves,
in order to be able to detect
them, you need

23:22.501 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really, truly massive objects.
So, in this
case, these were black holes
that had about

23:26.505 --> 23:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
30 times the mass of the sun in
them.

23:29.742 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why gravitational waves are
so interesting
is that they tell us something
about the universe

23:33.746 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you can't get from any
other kind of
astronomy. So, if you think
about optical

23:39.151 --> 23:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
astronomy, that looks at certain
classes of
light. If you look at radio
astronomy -- so

23:43.989 --> 23:46.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gravitational waves are
completely different.

23:46.492 --> 23:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They come from a different
sector of the universe,
and that's why they're so
exciting.

23:51.830 --> 23:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. So
Einstein is sitting
at his patent clerk's office
thinking about

23:55.100 --> 23:57.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this big thought, and what is
the connection
to space-time?

23:57.303 --> 23:59.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVE REITZE: Yes.

23:59.204 --> 24:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does time and
space bend?
And if you heard or saw, so to
speak, this

24:02.675 --> 24:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment, does that mean that time
and space
bent just a little bit at those
points?

24:07.579 --> 24:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE REITZE: Oh, in fact, this
particular
event was, as my colleague Kip
Thorne calls

24:12.084 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, a storm in space-time.

24:14.119 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right? As these two black
holes came together
and collided, they really
disrupted space-time

24:18.757 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and produced this burst of
gravitational radiation.
It's interesting that you
mention Einstein.

24:24.430 --> 24:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gravitational waves were first
predicted actually
100 years ago. And Einstein
himself, all right,

24:29.401 --> 24:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought it was an interesting
consequence
of the theory of relativity, but
didn't think

24:33.005 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it had any practical value,
because he
said that the effect is so tiny
that we will

24:37.076 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never be able to measure them.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it took 100 years from the
time that he
predicted them to the time we
have been able

24:43.816 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to measure them.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, also, to
measure them,
you have very giant antennae
that most people

24:47.486 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably haven't heard about
until today,
one in Louisiana and Washington.
Describe

24:50.723 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVE REITZE: So, these are two
interferometers.

24:53.525 --> 24:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interferometer is a -- basically
a type of
laser measuring device. A laser
goes out.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It goes -- it gets split. It
goes along the
arms of the interferometers. And
they're very

25:03.035 --> 25:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long. The arms are very long.
They're two-and-a-half-miles
long. Comes back. We do a lot of
tricks to

25:08.374 --> 25:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make the interferometer very
sensitive.

25:10.275 --> 25:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a gravitational wave
passes, what it
does is, it stretches and
squeezes the light

25:15.914 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between the arms of the
interferometer. And
because light is made up of
waves, we use

25:20.519 --> 25:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that that stretching
and squeezing
changes the relative
relationship, the phase,

25:26.091 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if you will, between the waves.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, do we --
how is it that
we got this sound? I mean, these
are lasers,

25:30.829 --> 25:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're seeing the disruption
or change
in light.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVE REITZE: Yes.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What does that
mean to say,
we heard two black holes?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVE REITZE: Right.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the interferometers are very
nice. They
basically -- the light goes on
in the detector,

25:40.639 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the frequency that these
gravitational
waves were generated by these
two block holes

25:45.477 --> 25:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in the audio band. So, you
could literally
-- it's like a C.D. player. You
could literally

25:50.315 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put a plug into the detector and
put headphones
on, after a little bit of data
processing

25:55.521 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and filtering.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not perfect, but after a
little bit of
data processing and filtering,
you can actually

25:59.358 --> 26:03.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear the signal. And it's a very
interesting
signal. It goes whoop like that.
Actually,

26:03.195 --> 26:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it goes a little bit lower, but
that gives
you the idea.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. All right.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what does this mean for
science? Does
this mean that there's new
branches of study

26:11.336 --> 26:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have opened up? What are
things that
people are going to think about
now because

26:15.641 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have this moment?

26:16.508 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVE REITZE: Yes.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there are two things
that are important
here. First of all, it's really
a big confirmation

26:21.079 --> 26:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that gravitational waves exist.
Now, we knew
they existed. There was a nice
experiment

26:25.150 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done by Hulse, Taylor, and
Weisberg early
on using radio waves. But this
is the first

26:29.688 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
direct measurement of them, and
so that's
exciting.

26:31.557 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the thing that's
more exciting
about it is, this opens up a
completely new

26:35.627 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way of looking at the universe.
So, everything
we know about the universe, we
know from light,

26:40.165 --> 26:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
electromagnetic radiation.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first time that the
universe is
communicating to us using
gravitational waves.

26:46.004 --> 26:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's like the cosmos is
talking to us.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. This makes
me think
of all the sci-fi movies that
are going to

26:52.277 --> 26:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spin off from this. Right?

26:53.345 --> 26:55.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVE REITZE: Yes.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If we can
measure that space
and time are bending and it's
happening all

26:58.083 --> 27:01.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around us, we just happen have
to have these
two little antennas on this tiny
little planet,

27:01.787 --> 27:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's probably happening all over
the universe.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVE REITZE: Right.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oh, yes, sure, sure, sure, sure.
And we hope
that we will be able to hear
more of more

27:07.793 --> 27:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these things as they go
along. And I should
point out that this is only the
beginning,

27:11.697 --> 27:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we're actually -- there are
projects
that are undergoing in Japan.
There's one

27:16.702 --> 27:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Italy right now that is
undergoing. We're
hoping to put a gravitational
wave detector

27:20.105 --> 27:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in India, because the more you
have of these
things, the more ears you have,
then actually

27:23.442 --> 27:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that gives you a huge advantage.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Dave Reitze from
Caltech, thanks so much for
joining us.

27:27.746 --> 27:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVE REITZE: Thank you. Been my
pleasure.

27:29.748 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have more
on Einstein's
theory and why it was so
revolutionary when

27:33.819 --> 27:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he posed it more than 100 years
ago.

27:36.255 --> 27:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Theoretical physicist Sean
Carroll wrote about
the twists and turns of
space-time in the

27:40.626 --> 27:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
universe, and you can read that
essay on our
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

27:59.845 --> 28:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
economics
of online dating; "City of
Thorns," a look

28:03.782 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the world's largest
refugee camp; and
comedian Billy Eichner explains
why he ambushes

28:09.755 --> 28:11.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people on the street.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But first, now to another
scientific breakthrough.

28:14.793 --> 28:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The planet is currently in the
midst of an
extinction crisis. As global
climate changes

28:19.364 --> 28:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and habitats disappear, species
all over the
world are at risk of being lost.
Breeding

28:25.103 --> 28:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these endangered animals is one
of the tools
researchers can use to combat
this decline,

28:29.942 --> 28:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that can be difficult to
accomplish.

28:32.744 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A recent innovation here in the
U.S. has given
new hope for some wolf species.

28:37.182 --> 28:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" science producer
Nsikan Akpan has
the story of the young puppies
that may help

28:42.454 --> 28:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
save the rest of the pack.

28:44.356 --> 28:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: It may be hard to
believe, but
these adorable puppies and how
they came into

28:50.262 --> 28:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world might be the key to
saving a whole
host of endangered species.

28:55.901 --> 29:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Smithsonian Conservation
Biology Institute
in Front Royal, Virginia,
scientists are developing

29:01.106 --> 29:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state-of-the-art reproduction
techniques to
try and save endangered species.
At the institute,

29:06.778 --> 29:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you will find everything from
cheetahs to
black-footed ferrets.

29:10.515 --> 29:15.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The scientists here are
perfecting tools like
artificial insemination and in
vitro fertilization

29:15.687 --> 29:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help the breeding of those
endangered animals.
A marquee case is the maned
wolf. They're

29:21.660 --> 29:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an endangered member of canid
the family,
which includes wolves, foxes,
and dogs. They're

29:26.999 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from South America.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Smithsonian conservation
biologist Nucharin
Songsasen says most of the
wolves' forest

29:32.738 --> 29:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
habitat has been lost to farming
and human
development.

29:35.807 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUCHARIN SONGSASEN, Smithsonian
Conservation
Biology Institute: Right now, we
estimate

29:39.011 --> 29:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 15,000 of them in the
wild. But the
problem with this species is
that their habitat

29:43.982 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is gone, that 85 percent is
lost. And only
2 percent of their natural
habitat is protected.

29:52.891 --> 29:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the population in the future
is not looking
very bright, because that's no
home for them.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NSIKAN AKPAN: To save the
species, she and
her colleagues are trying to
breed the wolves

30:02.634 --> 30:07.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in captivity for future
reintroduction to
the wild, but she says that's
tricky.

30:07.706 --> 30:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUCHARIN SONGSASEN: We hope they
will breed
naturally, but sometimes that's
not always

30:12.711 --> 30:18.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case. Sometimes, they have
these incompatibilities,
and they may not like each
other, and they

30:18.350 --> 30:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not want to have anything
to do with
each other.

30:20.952 --> 30:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Maned wolves are
monogamous,
and females tend to be very
particular when

30:24.756 --> 30:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it comes to choosing a boyfriend
or partner.

30:27.359 --> 30:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why scientists need
breeding tools
like in vitro fertilization, or
IVF. IVF is

30:32.564 --> 30:36.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commonly used in humans. It
first involves
harvesting an egg from the
female and putting

30:36.935 --> 30:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it into a dish. You then insert
the male sperm
into the egg, creating an
embryo, which is

30:42.274 --> 30:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then implanted into the mother.

30:44.409 --> 30:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But reproductive biologist
Jennifer Nagashima
says that, for decades,
scientists have struggled

30:48.814 --> 30:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make IVF work with dogs and
wolves.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA, Smithsonian
Conservation
Biology Institute: So, I like to
say that

30:52.818 --> 30:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dogs are a little bit weird.
They have a unique
reproductive physiology and
that's part of

30:56.321 --> 31:00.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
why IVF has really been a
challenge to develop
over the past 40 years.

31:00.358 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Nagashima says
that's in part
because canid reproductive
systems have some

31:04.396 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular quirks, like the fact
that females
just don't produce that many
eggs.

31:08.366 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: Female dogs
only cycle
once or twice a year, and this
is even more

31:12.404 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dramatic in wild canids who are
seasonal.
So you only have a population
event once a

31:17.976 --> 31:19.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

31:19.911 --> 31:23.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And even when that egg is
ovulated, it requires
another two to three days in the
reproductive

31:23.582 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tract, or the oviduct, to mature
and become
fertilizable. So, the result of
these two

31:28.820 --> 31:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things means that aren't that
many mature
eggs available to develop
technologies such

31:34.359 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as IVF.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: So, what Nagashima
and her colleagues
did was to troubleshoot the
entire reproductive

31:39.297 --> 31:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process. They started with basic
dog breeds
like beagles and cocker spaniel,
and then

31:44.703 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they figured out the best way
and time to
harvest the eggs.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They even found a way to give
male sperm a
little boost by adding
magnesium.

31:51.409 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: So, when we
added magnesium
back in, it actually promoted
the motility

31:55.947 --> 31:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the sperm, so the ability of
it to swim.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: So, you just
sprinkle a little
bit of magnesium, makes it a
better swimmer.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: Yes. Yes.
Exactly.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:04.456 --> 32:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The resulting
embryos were then
frozen. From there, the team had
to determine

32:07.392 --> 32:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the best time to implant the
embryos into
a surrogate mom.

32:11.029 --> 32:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's why. The would-be moms
had to be exactly
in synch with the development of
the embryos.

32:16.134 --> 32:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, even after implantation,
the team had
to constantly monitor the health
of the surrogates

32:21.106 --> 32:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure nothing went wrong
with their
pregnancies.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And two months later, success.
Seven healthy
puppies were born.

32:27.179 --> 32:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: The puppies
were born
July 10 of 2015, and so they're
just over

32:32.017 --> 32:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five months old right now, and
they are adorable,
healthy bundles of terror and
joy.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:39.024 --> 32:42.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The final
technique was published
in the journal "PLOS ONE." And
the story of

32:42.194 --> 32:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the puppies received worldwide
attention.

32:44.729 --> 32:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nagashima says these young dogs
are proof
the technique can work. And so
now the hope

32:48.967 --> 32:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to use it on threatened
species.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: The hope for
the maned
wolves and other endangered
canid species

32:54.272 --> 32:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that we will be able to use
this technology
to help their reproduction, so
to produce

32:59.611 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pups where otherwise we may not
be able to.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, a lot of times
in these very
small populations, if you have a
female that

33:07.085 --> 33:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passes away before she's been
able to breed,
we would really like to be able
to take her

33:11.423 --> 33:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ovaries, collect the eggs,
mature them, and
then use IVF to produce embryos
that would

33:16.962 --> 33:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
represent her as a mother.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Most of the litter
were adopted
by the researchers themselves,
because, A,

33:23.068 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who wouldn't want one of these
scientific
marvels? And, B, just look at
them.

33:26.972 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: This is
Cannon (ph). He
is a cocker beagle spaniel --
cocker spaniel-beagle

33:31.910 --> 33:32.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mix.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:33.778 --> 33:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: This is
Buddy. He is a
little bunch of joy.

33:37.983 --> 33:38.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:38.650 --> 33:40.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER NAGASHIMA: OK.

33:40.652 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Do you tell your
beagle what
he might mean for the survival
of future relatives?

33:44.890 --> 33:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUCHARIN SONGSASEN: Actually, I
do. I tell
him every day that he is very
important, he

33:48.894 --> 33:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a superstar. And -- but, you
know, he's
still a puppy. I'm not really
sure that he

33:55.533 --> 33:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understands what that means yet.
But, hopefully,
one day he will understand.

33:59.137 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Nsikan Akpan, in Front Royal,
Virginia.

34:10.315 --> 34:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Leading up to
Valentine's
Day, Paul Solman takes an encore
look at the

34:18.723 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economics of dating, how some
people are using
market principles to overcome
the traditional

34:23.929 --> 34:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
impediments to finding the
perfect match.

34:26.398 --> 34:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an updated presentation of
our Making
Sense series, which airs every
Thursday.

34:30.835 --> 34:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Facebook software
engineer Mike
O'Beirne, 23, AKA cirrussly
online, had been

34:38.076 --> 34:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking for a date since moving
to New York
four months ago.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE O'BEIRNE, Online Dater: It
was really
at my brother's urgings. He told
me I need

34:44.049 --> 34:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to start going out and dating
people.

34:45.917 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ad agency art
director Priyanka
Pulijal, also new to New York,
her love handle,

34:53.558 --> 34:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brbeatingcupcake. The BRB is
Webspeak for
be right back.

34:58.196 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRIYANKA PULIJAL, Online Dater:
I think you
have to meet a lot of different
people to

35:01.266 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first understand what you want.
And I think,
once you understand what you
want, you have

35:05.670 --> 35:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of different options.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what did they
want? Each other?

35:08.773 --> 35:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIYANKA PULIJAL: Hi. Nice to
meet you.

35:12.043 --> 35:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Last February, they
agreed to
let us record their very first
date.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE O'BEIRNE: Do you guys mind
leaving now?

35:20.218 --> 35:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, we would BRB.

35:23.154 --> 35:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But while we give our daters
some alone time,
we checked in with their online
matchmaker,

35:27.826 --> 35:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OkCupid. Founded a decade ago by
four Harvard
math majors, the site was owned
by IAC, the

35:36.668 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same media conglomerate that ran
Match.com,
which charges a monthly fee, and
the mobile

35:42.640 --> 35:44.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
app Tinder.

35:44.442 --> 35:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN RUDDER, Founder,
OkCupid: Between
OkCupid, Tinder or Match, we
will sign up

35:47.112 --> 35:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
easily over 30 million people
this year alone.

35:49.948 --> 35:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That was OkCupid
co-founder and
president Christian Rudder nine
months before

35:54.819 --> 36:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIC spun off the dating Web
sites, selling
stock in them to the public via
an IPO.

36:01.626 --> 36:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was already plenty of
competition, though;
eHarmony was big. And niche
sites were trending,

36:07.966 --> 36:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Jews, Christians, farmers,
sea captains,
mimes, the gluten-free, the
incarcerated,

36:17.509 --> 36:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the unhappily married, and of
course, accompanied
by Mozart.

36:21.846 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Welcome to
Purrsonals.com. As a fellow
cat owner, I know how finicky we
are.

36:27.819 --> 36:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But no matter how
finicky, you're
better off with more than less.

36:32.557 --> 36:35.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Imagine a
mixer with three
people. That would be a pretty
rough, pretty

36:35.860 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rough hour if you lasted even
that long there.
But OkCupid, metaphorically
speaking, is a

36:40.999 --> 36:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mixer with four million people.

36:42.901 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the language of
economics,
the study of maximizing human
welfare, this

36:48.239 --> 36:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is what's known as a thick
market.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER, Author, "Everything I
Ever Needed
to Know about Economics: I
Learned from Online

36:51.976 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dating": Where would you rather
buy a pair
of pants, at the Mall of America
or on the

36:55.647 --> 36:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets of a small town in
Oklahoma?

36:57.682 --> 37:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Paul Oyer
has actually
written a book, Everything I
Ever Needed to

37:02.921 --> 37:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Know about Economics I Learned
from Online
Dating, based on his own
adventures looking

37:08.960 --> 37:10.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for love.

37:10.995 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: So, I found myself
back in the
dating market in the fall of
2010, and, immediately,

37:15.500 --> 37:18.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as an economist, I saw that this
was a market
like so many others.

37:18.636 --> 37:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, not any old
market, like
the one for pants. This is a
market for what

37:23.942 --> 37:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economists call differentiated
goods.

37:26.978 --> 37:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: No two potential life
partners
are the same. Every single one
of them is

37:32.784 --> 37:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different. From an economics
perspective,
searching for a partner is just
cost-benefit

37:37.922 --> 37:38.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
analysis.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:39.190 --> 37:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: This isn't funny.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:42.293 --> 37:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: This is economics.

37:44.195 --> 37:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that analysis
includes, in
the lingo of economics, search
costs.

37:48.967 --> 37:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: It takes time and
effort to find
your mate. You have to set up
your dating

37:54.139 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profile. You have to go on a lot
of dates
that don't go anywhere. These
frictions, the

37:57.942 --> 38:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time spent looking for a mate,
lead to loneliness
or, as I like to say, romantic
unemployment.

38:04.916 --> 38:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oyer found himself
romantically
unemployed when he first took
the online dating

38:10.588 --> 38:17.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
plunge, as it happens, on
OkCupid, and had
written separated on his
profile. But at least

38:17.529 --> 38:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he didn't say he was actually
unemployed or
drug-happy or a glutton, even
bigger turnoffs.

38:25.403 --> 38:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are among the tidbits
gleaned from the
millions of responses in
OkCupid's database,

38:30.742 --> 38:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shared by Christian Rudder in
his book Dataclysm,
not that all are exactly
shockers.

38:36.214 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: When people
come to a dating
site, all they look at is the
pictures, for

38:40.885 --> 38:42.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the most part.

38:42.787 --> 38:47.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rudder has since
left OkCupid,
but beneath the sidewalks of New
York, Erika

38:47.759 --> 38:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christensen is still hawking
what is arguably
a more discriminating approach.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIKA CHRISTENSEN,
Trainspottings.com: You
are very handsome. Are you
single, by any

38:54.966 --> 38:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chance? If you find yourself
single, I'm a
matchmaker.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, a real live
matchmaker whose
turf happens to be the subway.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIKA CHRISTENSEN: You are very
handsome.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The days leading up
to Valentine's
Day are the busiest of the year
for this Hello

39:07.545 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dolly of the L Train, at the
moment, looking
for lasting love on behalf of
two 30-something

39:14.652 --> 39:16.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
female professionals.

39:16.521 --> 39:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIKA CHRISTENSEN: What we're
dealing with
is the biological clock, and
these women want

39:20.158 --> 39:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 35-to-45-year old man quick.
They want
him yesterday.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So you mean that
you're sizing
up these guys as...

39:27.098 --> 39:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIKA CHRISTENSEN: Potential
baby daddies,
that's right.

39:29.601 --> 39:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Since time is
money, clients
are willing to pay a couple of
grand or more,

39:34.939 --> 39:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes much more. OkCupid, by
contrast,
is free. But, to Christensen,
you get what

39:41.546 --> 39:43.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you pay for.

39:43.448 --> 39:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIKA CHRISTENSEN: I think
online dating is
great, but it's basically humans
as commodities.

39:47.151 --> 39:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There's another
objection to
online dating as well.

39:50.455 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
R.D. ROSEN, Author: OkCupid, by
making a huge
universe of people available to
you at any

39:56.160 --> 40:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
minute, doesn't that work
against a rational
decision about whether to invest
in the relationship

40:01.966 --> 40:03.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you have?

40:03.801 --> 40:07.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Writer R.D. Rosen,
who's used
online dating, is working on a
book about

40:08.006 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how courtship is evolving.

40:09.874 --> 40:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
R.D. ROSEN There's an enormously
addictive
quality to online dating that
has never existed

40:14.946 --> 40:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before in the culture. You want
to keep going
back, because you think you're
going to hit

40:19.550 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the jackpot eventually.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rudder doesn't deny
it.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Whether you're
gay or straight,
we're constantly showing you
people. There

40:25.023 --> 40:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might be someone better looking
or who has
a cooler profile or whatever it
is just right

40:28.026 --> 40:28.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the corner always.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And not just gay or
straight.

40:31.095 --> 40:34.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMENA ALMENDARES, OkCupid: At
OkCupid, we
have 22 genders and 13
orientations.

40:34.599 --> 40:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's right, 22
genders and
13 orientations, including our
favorite, sapiosexual,

40:42.273 --> 40:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attracted to intelligence. And
to further
complicate, chief product
officer Jimena Almendares

40:49.013 --> 40:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has just added another option.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMENA ALMENDARES: Earlier this
year, we launched
a feature that if people are
searching for

40:54.886 --> 40:59.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
someone else in their
relationship, they can
actually publicly state that and
people that

40:59.691 --> 41:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are interested can respond.

41:01.492 --> 41:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To Paul Oyer,
though, a surfeit
of choice is just another search
cost, for

41:06.698 --> 41:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which economists have a fairly
simple solution:

41:09.200 --> 41:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: What you need to do
is you need
to settle, to say, I have
somebody who's good

41:13.037 --> 41:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough. People hate it when we
say that. But
it's the way -- it's the way a
rational economist

41:21.245 --> 41:23.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would think about it.

41:23.181 --> 41:27.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But wait a minute.
After my first
date with my now wife, I knew
she was the

41:27.485 --> 41:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perfect mate. And last year was
our 30th anniversary.

41:30.521 --> 41:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL OYER: The perfect one for
you doesn't
exist. But there's a very
important idea in

41:36.060 --> 41:41.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
labor economics called
firm-specific human
capital. And that is, as you
work at a company

41:41.132 --> 41:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a longer time, you have
certain skills
that are valuable at that
company and not

41:46.170 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elsewhere.

41:47.972 --> 41:51.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, you have built up
something we will
call marriage-specific human
capital. You

41:51.909 --> 41:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have developed your life around
your wife,
such that she probably is the
best match for

41:57.048 --> 41:58.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you at this point.

41:58.549 --> 42:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, our
daters had to
get back to their jobs.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how had it gone?

42:04.589 --> 42:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE O'BEIRNE: So, we both found
out that
we had like way more in common
than we expected.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRIYANKA PULIJAL: I felt we
really connected
about a lot of different things.

42:11.596 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE O'BEIRNE: I will probably
e-mail her
later.

42:14.332 --> 42:20.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Actually, he
didn't. That same
week, he met a new flame.

42:20.938 --> 42:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Priyanka began dating
an old friend.
A year later, they're still
going strong.

42:28.212 --> 42:34.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As for me, Paul Solman,
economics correspondent
for the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
still ever-so-happily

42:34.986 --> 42:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
married, and wishing all of you,
online and
off, another welfare-maximizing
Valentine's

42:41.292 --> 42:45.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

42:46.063 --> 42:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The newest
addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf takes a
most intimate

42:58.443 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at one of the world's
oldest refugee
camps administered by the United
Nations,

43:03.815 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
originally established in 1991
as a temporary
haven for Somalis fleeing their
civil war.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Ben Rawlence recently
talked to Judy
Woodruff about his book "City of
Thorns: Nine

43:15.026 --> 43:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lives in the World's Largest
Refugee Camp."

43:17.295 --> 43:19.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ben Rawlence,
welcome.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE, Author, "City of
Thorns: Nine
Lives in the World's Largest
Refugee Camp":

43:20.698 --> 43:22.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we're hearing
a lot about
refugees these days, but you are
writing about

43:25.870 --> 43:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group of refugees we hear
almost nothing
about.

43:29.507 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What drew you to Kenya? What
drew to you this
camp?

43:32.376 --> 43:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Well, for nearly
10 years, I
worked for Human Rights Watch.

43:36.280 --> 43:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I first came to Dadaab, this
refugee camp,
in 2010. And the place just blew
my mind.

43:42.954 --> 43:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a complete shock to me
that I hadn't
heard about it before, and, in
fact, that

43:47.124 --> 43:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this place should still exist.
At that time,
it was 20 years old. And now
it's 25 years

43:52.129 --> 43:53.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

43:54.031 --> 43:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It started out as
something
much smaller, refugees -- one
group of refugees.

43:59.704 --> 44:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's grown into something much
bigger and,
frankly, much worse.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN RAWLENCE: Yes.

44:05.009 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Dadaab is the world's
biggest. The
Somali refugees came in 1991.
Since then,

44:10.281 --> 44:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalia has descended into
different phases
of a civil war, and there have
been waves

44:15.186 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of refugees, more and more
coming, until it
peaked in 2011, with around
half-a-million

44:20.491 --> 44:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees living in this one
place.

44:22.693 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a bit like New Orleans.
It's that many
people, but spread over 30
square miles. The

44:29.734 --> 44:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tents are made of -- or the
houses are made
of tents or sticks and mud. And
it's -- there's

44:36.407 --> 44:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no permanent structures. So,
there's no plumbing.
There's no concrete. There's no
running water.

44:43.314 --> 44:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a humanitarian disaster
still, even after
25 years. It's constructed on
temporary lines,

44:49.487 --> 44:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and yet it's become permanent.

44:51.355 --> 44:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's people
living in conditions
it's almost impossible to
imagine. And yet

44:56.060 --> 44:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you write about how there's
organization there.
There's structure there.

45:00.064 --> 45:05.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Well, you can deny
a city permanent
structures, but you can't deny
people the

45:05.937 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right to associate and to make
societies.

45:08.272 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, that's what's
happened. People
have made their own soccer
leagues. They have

45:13.778 --> 45:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fallen in love. There are many
love stories
in this book.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: The people have
had children.
And then, sometimes, those
children have had

45:20.851 --> 45:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children. So we're now on to
three generations.

45:22.954 --> 45:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, they're going to
school. There
are hospitals. There's a market,
a black market,

45:28.826 --> 45:32.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lots of smuggling and so on. So,
people have
nonetheless made a life for
themselves.

45:32.663 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You picked just a
few individuals
to write about. And you tell
their stories

45:38.135 --> 45:42.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a very powerful way. Why did
you choose
these individuals, these people?

45:42.974 --> 45:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Well, firstly, I
was trying
very consciously to sort of
break open the

45:48.679 --> 45:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media ennui, if you like, kind
of -- you see
the eyes glaze when you talk
about refugees

45:53.718 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and famine, because we think we
have seen
it all before.

45:56.721 --> 46:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think we know what a refugee
camp look
likes, with these lines of tents
and so on.

46:01.192 --> 46:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see Angelina Jolie and the
celebrities
doing their thing. But,
actually, what was

46:05.696 --> 46:10.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting to me is, what
happens when she
goes? What's daily life like for
all of these

46:10.301 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people?

46:12.203 --> 46:18.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wanted to really give you
a ground-eye
view of what goes on. And I
chose those nine

46:18.376 --> 46:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through a long process, really.
I started
with about 50 people, and then
nine made the

46:23.414 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cut.

46:25.316 --> 46:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The world is --
has virtually
forgotten about this place, if
it ever knew

46:28.519 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it. What do you want
people to take
away from this?

46:31.522 --> 46:36.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Well, the first
thing I wanted
to do was to make you feel, to
make you care

46:36.360 --> 46:41.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the people stuck in this
place, because,
certainly, they feel forgotten.
In large part,

46:41.465 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have been ignored by the
international
media.

46:44.068 --> 46:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to get beyond the headlines,
to actually
see -- make you see these people
as humans,

46:50.074 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with all the normal struggles
you would imagine,
of trying to find a job, make a
living, things

46:55.212 --> 46:59.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that, to try and bridge the
gap, to make
people feel connected, that
these are not

46:59.750 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just numbers, but these are
faces. These are
real people with hopes and
dreams.

47:03.688 --> 47:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we start thinking of
refugees more
in those -- in those ways,
hopefully, then

47:09.427 --> 47:14.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can start seeing a bit more
intelligent
policy, a bit more humanity at
the political

47:14.398 --> 47:15.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level as well.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're looking
at the faces
of a few of the people.

47:18.369 --> 47:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Yes, these are the
some of the
people in the camp. This is my
friend Nisho,

47:23.541 --> 47:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the taller guy. And Mahat is his
young sidekick.

47:26.410 --> 47:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they work as porters in the
market. They
load and off-load the trucks
that come in

47:33.017 --> 47:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smuggling goods from Somalia and
also a lot
of the food rations, because
they're not allowed

47:38.022 --> 47:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work. Refugees can't leave.
They can't
work. So they have to find these
informal

47:42.493 --> 47:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jobs, scrabbling a living as
best they can.

47:44.762 --> 47:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it in
these young boys
and everyone else that gives
them the strength

47:50.134 --> 47:52.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to keep going? What is it inside
them?

47:52.737 --> 47:57.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: Well, that's one
of the questions
that drew me to write about the
place in the

47:57.341 --> 47:59.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first instance.

47:59.310 --> 48:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't understand, how do
you put up with
this? You know, why are there
not some kind

48:03.080 --> 48:08.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of mass riots and protests and
burning down
the U.N. office and so on? But
people do put

48:08.753 --> 48:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up with it because they have no
option. They
can't go back to Somalia. Kenya
doesn't want

48:14.725 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. The resettlement system,
where countries
share the burden of refugees
through the quota

48:20.364 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, is completely broken,
because the
birth rate in the camp, for
example, is 1,000

48:25.770 --> 48:27.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a month.

48:27.671 --> 48:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The international community
takes around 2,000
a year of people from Dadaab. So
that's why

48:31.275 --> 48:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are choosing the illegal
route to come
to Europe or elsewhere, instead
of waiting

48:36.547 --> 48:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the formal legal process.

48:38.382 --> 48:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the
future for them?
What's the hope for them?

48:42.253 --> 48:45.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN RAWLENCE: I'm afraid the
reality is, it's
pretty bleak.

48:45.656 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see no real solution for
Dadaab. And as
long as there's no international
solution

48:51.262 --> 48:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or political solution, the camp
will continue.
These people will be stuck in
limbo.

48:55.966 --> 49:01.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said, we're now on to our
third generation
of people living in this
situation. And this

49:01.705 --> 49:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is one city. There are many
other temporary
cities like this in Ethiopia, in
Sudan, in

49:07.578 --> 49:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yemen, these cities that are
going on and
on, which is why I think we need
to hear about

49:12.750 --> 49:17.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this place. We need to
understand it. And
then we need a Marshall Plan for
refugees

49:17.621 --> 49:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that people have been talking
about.

49:19.390 --> 49:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to fix this broken
system, but the
world has gotten a bit harder, I
think, a

49:23.894 --> 49:25.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little less generous.

49:25.796 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Ben
Rawlence, you certainly
shine a light on to what's
happening there.

49:30.568 --> 49:33.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more people will know about
it as a result
of the book.

49:33.370 --> 49:37.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's "City of Thorns: Nine Lives
in the World's
Largest Refugee Camp."

49:37.575 --> 49:42.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

49:42.780 --> 49:47.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN RAWLENCE: Thank you.

49:47.985 --> 49:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
another installment
of Brief But Spectacular, our
series where

49:54.558 --> 49:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

49:57.061 --> 50:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from comedian
Billy Eichner,
star of "Billy on the Street" on
truTV and

50:02.366 --> 50:07.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Hulu original series
"Difficult People."
He opens up about his comedic
style and process.

50:07.371 --> 50:11.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER, Comedian: We were
filming recently,
and someone yelled out from
across the street,

50:11.775 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Billy, please harass me," which
is a really
strange request.

50:19.783 --> 50:29.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Billy on the Street" is a game
show in New
York City where I ambush people
on the street

50:29.260 --> 50:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with pop culture trivia. It also
features
celebrity guests helping me
ambush people.

50:34.732 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My favorite segments are the
Super Bowl, where
I asked the New York giants what
they thought

50:39.536 --> 50:40.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Madonna halftime show.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sir, are you excited about
Madonna?

50:41.472 --> 50:41.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Madonna?

50:42.072 --> 50:42.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILLY EICHNER: Yes.

50:42.706 --> 50:43.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: No, absolutely not.

50:43.774 --> 50:44.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: Why? She's the
halftime show.

50:44.408 --> 50:45.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: She's an old hag.

50:45.276 --> 50:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: You're an old
hag!

50:45.943 --> 50:46.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hey, did you see Madonna?

50:46.310 --> 50:47.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

50:47.111 --> 50:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: She was amazing.

50:47.878 --> 50:48.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I was in the locker room.

50:48.445 --> 50:52.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILLY EICHNER: OK.

50:52.816 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We did a segment with the first
lady this
year, Michelle Obama, and I had
her push me

50:57.855 --> 51:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around in a shopping cart while
I read Gwyneth
Paltrow's Oscar acceptance
speech for "Shakespeare

51:02.760 --> 51:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Love," which is what you do
when you have
the first lady on your show.

51:06.697 --> 51:08.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And away we go.

51:08.432 --> 51:10.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I would like to thank the
Academy from the
bottom of my heart. I would like
to thank

51:10.734 --> 51:13.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our miraculous cast and crew."

51:13.837 --> 51:18.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For $1, be honest. Who is
hotter, Abraham
Lincoln or Barack Obama?

51:18.142 --> 51:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: Oh,
Barack Obama.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: Oh, sorry, it's
Abraham Lincoln.

51:23.647 --> 51:26.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Billy on the Street" is -- it's
a persona.
It's a performance. It's pretty
much my id

51:26.183 --> 51:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a 12-year-old kid, like,
blown up.

51:29.887 --> 51:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Difficult People," which is a
scripted half-hour
show on Hulu created by my
friend Julie Klausner,

51:35.259 --> 51:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a great writer, performer.

51:36.827 --> 51:38.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: I am starving.

51:38.362 --> 51:41.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: I know. I'm
trying to order
food. There is no Wi-Fi.

51:41.532 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: What are we supposed to
do, wander
around the neighborhood and try
to find something?

51:44.568 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: No. And you know
what kind
of food they are going to have
in this neighborhood?

51:46.503 --> 51:48.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be Turkish food
and tapas. Just
kill him.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: A moment of silence for
the deceased,
please.

51:51.575 --> 51:54.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY EICHNER: It's "Will &amp;
Grace," but more
unattractive and more unlikable,
which is

51:54.945 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what America wants.

51:57.047 --> 52:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am gay. And I'm in comedy. I
don't know
what to say about it. I was so
blind to homophobia

52:04.088 --> 52:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as kid. I grew in New York. I
went to Stuyvesant,
a really nerdy math-science
school, where

52:08.559 --> 52:10.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no one had sex.

52:10.427 --> 52:14.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When everyone asks me, was it a
conscious
choice to be out of the closet
as a comedian,

52:14.231 --> 52:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was like, I don't know. Was it
a conscious
choice to be white? I don't
know. This is

52:18.669 --> 52:22.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just like what I bring to the
table. It's
just not that big of a deal.

52:22.506 --> 52:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we all have the same issues.
My gay married
friends with kids are just as
boring and annoying

52:27.444 --> 52:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as my straight married friends
with kids now.
And I don't want to hang out
with any of them,

52:31.315 --> 52:33.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be honest.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hi, I'm Billy Eichner, and this
is my Brief
But Spectacular take on the most
difficult

52:36.687 --> 52:38.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

you capture
the majesty of a place like
Yosemite National

52:49.733 --> 52:54.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park in one frame? It's a feat
the National
Park Service is hoping someone
will master

52:54.772 --> 53:00.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when it hires an official
photographer this
summer. So how do you do it? We
asked "National

Kathy Moran
