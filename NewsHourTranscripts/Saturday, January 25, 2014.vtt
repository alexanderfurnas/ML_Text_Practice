07:33.967 --> 07:35.867
ADJUSTMENT FOR A NUMBER OF

07:35.867 --> 07:37.267
EMERGING ECONOMIES THAT HAD SEEN

07:37.267 --> 07:40.033
A FLOOD OF MONEY COME INTO THEIR

07:40.033 --> 07:41.067
MARKETS AS A RESULT OF LOW

07:41.067 --> 07:42.600
INTEREST RATES AROUND THE WORLD.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.467
SO IN TURKEY, FOR INSTANCE

07:44.467 --> 07:45.600
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A FAIR

07:45.600 --> 07:47.933
AMOUNT OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.400
AND COMBINED WITH THE MOVES BY

07:50.400 --> 07:52.100
THE FED, INVESTORS ARE STARTIN

07:52.100 --> 07:52.633
TO FLEE.

07:52.633 --> 07:56.200
NOBODY WANTS TO BE LEFT THER

07:56.200 --> 07:57.333
HOLDING AN INVESTMENT THAT'S

07:57.333 --> 07:59.000
GOING TO TURN BAD VERY QUICKLY

07:59.000 --> 08:01.333
YOU'RE SEEING A SIMILAR FORCE IN

08:01.333 --> 08:03.800
SOUTH AFRICA, IN BRAZIL, EVE

08:03.800 --> 08:05.367
ARGENTINA, WHICH HAS BEEN A BI

08:05.367 --> 08:06.433
OF AN ECONOMIC MESS.

08:06.433 --> 08:07.500
INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES

08:07.500 --> 08:09.600
ARE LOOKING AT THIS AN

08:09.600 --> 08:10.433
WONDERING WHETHER GLOBAL GROWT

08:10.433 --> 08:12.500
IS GOING TO HOLD UP, WHETHER THE

08:12.500 --> 08:13.400
ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS GOING

08:13.400 --> 08:14.967
TO BE ABLE TO BE PROPELLED B

08:14.967 --> 08:15.933
SOME OF THE FORCES THAT HAVE

08:15.933 --> 08:17.467
BEEN PROPELLING IT FOR THE LAS

08:17.467 --> 08:17.867
FIVE YEARS

08:17.867 --> 08:18.867
>> OKAY.

08:18.867 --> 08:19.933
THERE WAS ALSO A MANUFACTURING

08:19.933 --> 08:21.400
REPORT IN CHINA.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.133
WHY WAS THAT SO SIGNIFICANT?

08:23.133 --> 08:25.000
>> THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT BECAUS

08:25.000 --> 08:26.600
CHINA OF COURSE IS THE SECON

08:26.600 --> 08:27.433
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD

08:27.433 --> 08:28.633
AND THERE HAVE BEE

08:28.633 --> 08:30.367
LONG-STANDING FEARS ABOUT WHAT

08:30.367 --> 08:32.933
WILL HAPPEN AS CHINA TRIES T

08:32.933 --> 08:33.833
REBALANCE ITS ECONOMY.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.967
IT'S TRYING TO SHIFT FROM BEIN

08:34.967 --> 08:37.967
A BIG EXPORTER TO PROVIDING MORE

08:37.967 --> 08:39.167
OF ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH FRO

08:39.167 --> 08:40.867
HOME, FROM ITS OWN CITIZENS.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.667
AND AS IT DOES THAT, IT'

08:42.667 --> 08:45.100
STARTING TO DO THIS ADJUSTMENT

08:45.100 --> 08:47.033
AND THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS I

08:47.033 --> 08:49.100
CHINA LIKE A BIG PROPERTY BUBBLE

08:49.100 --> 08:50.733
THAT LEADS TO DEFLATE AND IT

08:50.733 --> 08:52.833
LEADERSHIP KNOWS IT NEEDS TO

08:52.833 --> 08:53.033
DEFLATE.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.267
WHEN CHINA HAS BEEN A GROWTH

08:54.267 --> 08:55.467
ENGINE FOR THE WORLD AND THA

08:55.467 --> 08:57.033
STARTS TO PULL BACK IT MAKES

08:57.033 --> 08:58.867
EMERGING MARKETS VERY NERVOUS,

08:58.867 --> 09:00.700
IT MAKES DEVELOPED ECONOMIES

09:00.700 --> 09:01.167
NERVOUS, BECAUSE THE UNITE

09:01.167 --> 09:02.300
STATES AND EUROPE ARE SELLIN

09:02.300 --> 09:03.533
INTO CHINA NOT JUST BUYING

09:03.533 --> 09:04.167
PRODUCTS FROM IT

09:04.167 --> 09:07.067
>> BESIDES THE DECISION BY THE

09:07.067 --> 09:07.867
FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES HERE

09:07.867 --> 09:09.100
AND CHINESE MANUFACTURING WHAT'S

09:09.100 --> 09:12.033
TRIBUTE TOGETHER ARGENTINEAN

09:12.033 --> 09:13.900
CURRENCY OR THE TURKISH CURRENCY

09:13.900 --> 09:14.200
TO DEVALUE SO QUICKLY AGAINS

09:14.200 --> 09:16.967
THE DOLLAR

09:16.967 --> 09:19.433
>> WELL, YOU'RE SEEING A

09:19.433 --> 09:22.600
REVERSAL AMONG INVESTORS I

09:22.600 --> 09:23.867
ARGENTINA BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD SO

09:23.867 --> 09:25.467
MANY PROBLEMS SINCE ITS CURRENCY

09:25.467 --> 09:27.933
CRISIS IN 2001, 2002

09:27.933 --> 09:28.800
INVESTORS AREN'T REALLY GIVING

09:28.800 --> 09:30.367
THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AT

09:30.367 --> 09:32.433
ALL AND FLEEING VERY QUICKLY

09:32.433 --> 09:34.633
TURKEY HAS ITS OWN ISSUES.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.433
AND PEOPLE ARE PULLING OUT O

09:36.433 --> 09:36.800
THERE.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.267
THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS WHETHE

09:38.267 --> 09:40.900
THESE RISKS ARE DEALT WITH A

09:40.900 --> 09:42.600
EMERGING MARKETS AS A WHOLE AN

09:42.600 --> 09:44.067
INVESTORS TREAT THEM ALL ALIKE

09:44.067 --> 09:46.133
OR WHETHER THEY START TO

09:46.133 --> 09:47.100
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN OTHE

09:47.100 --> 09:48.700
ECONOMIES, MEXICO FOR INSTANCE

09:48.700 --> 09:50.633
IS AN EMERGING ECONOMY THA

09:50.633 --> 09:51.600
WOULD HAVE BEEN WRECKED BY

09:51.600 --> 09:52.200
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE BUT

09:52.200 --> 09:53.533
IT'S IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION

09:53.533 --> 09:53.667
NOW.

09:53.667 --> 09:54.967
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WATC

09:54.967 --> 09:57.767
OVER THE COMING WEEKS WHETHE

09:57.767 --> 09:58.333
INVESTORS CAN HANDLE

09:58.333 --> 09:59.233
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE

09:59.233 --> 10:01.233
BETWEEN SOME OF THESE ECONOMIES.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.500
>> SO IS WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY

10:03.500 --> 10:04.800
SOMETHING JUST A SHORT-TER

10:04.800 --> 10:06.100
REACTION

10:06.100 --> 10:07.467
AND TO PUT THATPERSPECTIVE

10:07.467 --> 10:09.233
IT'S ONLY A 2% DROP COMPARED T

10:09.233 --> 10:11.267
A 30% SORT OF POSITIVE YEAR.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.333
>> IT IS A VERY SHORT-TERM

10:13.333 --> 10:13.467
REACTION

10:13.467 --> 10:15.500
WE CAN'T GET AHEAD OF THINKING

10:15.500 --> 10:17.133
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG SLIDE

10:17.133 --> 10:17.300
DOWN

10:17.300 --> 10:18.433
IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THIS

10:18.433 --> 10:19.900
WOULD BE THE BEGINNING STAGES OF

10:19.900 --> 10:21.467
A CURRENCY CRISIS.

10:21.467 --> 10:22.600
BUT WE'VE GONE THROUGH MOMENTS

10:22.600 --> 10:24.467
LIKE THIS BEFORE AND GONE PAST

10:24.467 --> 10:25.267
THEM FAIRLY EASILY

10:25.267 --> 10:26.600
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

10:26.600 --> 10:27.333
FORCES BUILDING UP

10:27.333 --> 10:30.233
AND IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR TO

10:30.233 --> 10:30.633
INVESTORS HOW SOMETHING LIKE

10:30.633 --> 10:31.533
THIS SETTLES OUT

10:31.533 --> 10:32.933
THESE ARE A LOT OF FORCES THAT

10:32.933 --> 10:34.300
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN COME

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
TOGETHER LIKE THIS BEFORE.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.800
CERTAINLY FROM THE FED AND WHA

10:36.800 --> 10:38.433
YOU'RE SEEING IN CHINA AND A

10:38.433 --> 10:40.733
NUMBER OF THESE BIGGER EMERGIN

10:40.733 --> 10:41.267
MARKETS.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.033
IT'S AN UNUSUAL ADJUSTMENT FOR

10:43.033 --> 10:44.233
INVESTORS AND FOR MARKETS.

10:44.233 --> 10:49.167
SO WE NEED TO WATCH WHETHER THIS

10:49.167 --> 10:51.000
RICOCHETS THROUGH OTHER MARKET

10:51.000 --> 10:53.067
OR WHETHER WE START TO SEE

10:53.067 --> 10:54.400
INVESTORS GET A LITTLE CALME

10:54.400 --> 10:55.467
AND NOT OVERREACT TO SOME OF

10:55.467 --> 10:56.000
THESE MOVES.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.767
>> ALL RIGHT

10:57.767 --> 10:58.833

12:27.633 --> 12:29.400
THAT SELLS SOAP AND TOILETRIES

12:29.400 --> 12:30.567
AND CLEANING PRODUCTS.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.333
HE SAID THE REAL PROBLEM WIT

12:31.333 --> 12:34.000
THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS

12:34.000 --> 12:34.100
INFLATION.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.700
AND IN FACT, ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

12:36.700 --> 12:38.800
PRICES FOR CONSUMER GOODS AN

12:38.800 --> 12:40.233
EVERYDAY ITEMS HAVE GONE THROUGH

12:40.233 --> 12:41.033
THE ROOF

12:41.033 --> 12:42.433
AT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT THE

13:03.433 --> 13:07.333
5,000 REAL S

14:31.700 --> 14:33.267
SHORTAGES?

14:33.267 --> 14:33.667
SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICINE

14:33.667 --> 14:34.633
>> Reporter: WE WENT TO

14:34.633 --> 14:36.200
HOSPITAL IN DOWNTOWN TEHRAN.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.867
IT'S ACTUALLY A JEWISH CHARITY

14:37.867 --> 14:39.400
HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF TH

14:39.400 --> 14:39.667
CITY

14:39.667 --> 14:44.167
AND THERE WE MET A DOCTOR, A

14:44.167 --> 14:45.767
FASCINATING CHARACTER, THIS BIG,

14:45.767 --> 14:47.200
BURLY, CHAIN-SMOKING, JEWISH

14:47.200 --> 14:47.533
DOCTOR

14:47.533 --> 14:49.400
YES, THERE ARE ABOUT 30,000 JEWS

14:49.400 --> 14:50.200
IN IRAN.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.633
HE'S WORKING IN A JEWISH

14:52.633 --> 14:54.367
HOSPITAL THAT'S CATERING MOSTL

14:54.367 --> 14:56.400
TO LOWER AND MIDDLE CLAS

14:56.400 --> 14:58.133
IRANIANS IN TEHRAN

14:58.133 --> 15:00.200
IN HIS OFFICE HE HAS PORE TRAITS

15:00.200 --> 15:02.533
OF AYATOLLAH KHOMENEI ON ONE

15:02.533 --> 15:03.900
SIDE, AND MOSES AND HIS BROTHE

15:03.900 --> 15:04.933
ON THE OTHER

15:04.933 --> 15:06.033
VERY, VERY INTERESTING GUY

15:06.033 --> 15:07.733
HE DESCRIBED TO US, YES, BECAUSE

15:07.733 --> 15:09.533
OF SANCTIONS HE HAS HAD A VERY

15:09.533 --> 15:10.733
DIFFICULT TIME GETTING A LOT O

15:10.733 --> 15:12.000
THE MEDICATIONS THAT HE NEED

15:12.000 --> 15:13.533
FOR HIS PATIENTS

15:13.533 --> 15:15.333
AND HE SAID IT'S NOT SO MUCH

15:15.333 --> 15:16.800
THAT THERE'S PROHIBITIONS ON

15:16.800 --> 15:18.567
SELLING THE MEDICINES, PER SE.

15:18.567 --> 15:19.767
IN FACT, U.S. TREASURY

15:19.767 --> 15:20.900
DEPARTMENT OFFERS EXEMPTIONS FOR

15:20.900 --> 15:21.800
THOSE THINGS

15:21.800 --> 15:24.333
HE SAYS IT'S BECAUSE THAT TH

15:24.333 --> 15:25.733
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT AR

15:25.733 --> 15:28.167
PROHIBITED BY SANCTIONS MEAN

15:28.167 --> 15:29.233
THAT WESTERN PHARMACEUTICA

15:29.233 --> 15:30.733
COMPANIES FOR THE MOST PART WILL

15:30.733 --> 15:32.967
NOT DO BUSINESS WITH IRANIAN

15:32.967 --> 15:34.400
FIRMS.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.300
AND SO THERE'S SHORTAGE OF VER

15:35.300 --> 15:36.600
SPECIFIC DRUGS HE HAS A VERY

15:36.600 --> 15:37.733
HARD TIME GETTING AND HE SAI

15:37.733 --> 15:39.433
IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.067
>> DID YOU MEET OTHER PEOPLE WHO

15:41.067 --> 15:42.633
SAID THEY WERE AFFECTED BY THE

15:42.633 --> 15:42.800
SANCTIONS?

15:42.800 --> 15:44.033
>> Reporter: YEAH, WE DID SEE

15:44.033 --> 15:44.933
FEW EXAMPLES

15:44.933 --> 15:46.367
ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLE WET FOUND

15:46.367 --> 15:49.300
IN THE CITY OF ISFAHAN, TH

15:49.300 --> 15:51.200
ANCIENT CAPITAL, A FIVE TO

15:51.200 --> 15:52.533
SIX-HOUR DRIVE SOUTH OF TEHRAN

15:52.533 --> 15:54.967
AND THERE WE MET A YOUNG MAN

15:54.967 --> 15:57.967
WHOSE NAME IS ROGHANI.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.600
HE HAS AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN

15:59.600 --> 16:00.233
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

16:00.233 --> 16:02.000
HE USED TO WORK IN THE AUT

16:02.000 --> 16:03.400
INDUSTRY, HIS FAMILY BUSINES

16:03.400 --> 16:05.100
MADE PARTS FOR MOTORS.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
SANCTIONS HAD VERY SPECIFICALL

16:06.500 --> 16:08.367
TARGETS I RAN'S AUTOMOBILE

16:08.367 --> 16:08.600
INDUSTRY

16:08.600 --> 16:10.067
AND SO A LOT OF JOBS HAD BEE

16:10.067 --> 16:11.733
LOST AND THAT INDUSTRY HAS

16:11.733 --> 16:12.800
REALLY SORT OF BEEN CONTRACTED

16:12.800 --> 16:14.167
QUITE CONSIDERABLY

16:14.167 --> 16:16.133
SO THIS YOUNG MAN GETS OUT O

16:16.133 --> 16:18.300
THAT BUSINESS AND HE JOINS HIS

16:18.300 --> 16:19.100
FATHER'S SHOE BUSINESS

16:19.100 --> 16:21.867
SO HE IS NOW A MECHANICA

16:21.867 --> 16:24.000
ENGINEER USING HIS SKILLS TO

16:24.000 --> 16:25.167
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE NEW

16:25.167 --> 16:25.367
SHOES.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.533
HE MAKES THESE VERY COOL BLU

16:27.533 --> 16:28.433
WING TIP SHOES AND THINGS LIKE

16:28.433 --> 16:28.700
THAT

16:28.700 --> 16:30.433
>> SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE HEAR

16:30.433 --> 16:32.500
THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMEN

16:32.500 --> 16:33.933
CENSORS THE INTERNET

16:33.933 --> 16:35.167
IN YOUR TIME THERE, WHAT DID YOU

16:35.167 --> 16:35.467
SEE?

16:35.467 --> 16:37.333
>> Reporter: THE INTERNET IS

16:37.333 --> 16:38.300
HEAVILY REGULATED.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.967
THE GOVERNMENT HAS STRINLG

16:40.967 --> 16:42.800
CONTROLS OVER WHAT SITES YOU CAN

16:42.800 --> 16:43.567
VISIT AND CAN'T VISIT.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.633
IF YOU TRY TO ACCESS A SITE THAT

16:45.633 --> 16:46.900
IS BLOCKED, TWITTER OR FACEBOOK,

16:46.900 --> 16:48.733
WHAT POPS UP IS THIS GOVERNMEN

16:48.733 --> 16:51.167
WEBSITE THAT SAYS, THIS SITE I

16:51.167 --> 16:52.733
BLOCKED, AND OFFERS THIS HELPFUL

16:52.733 --> 16:54.733
LIST OF OTHER WEBSITES YOU MIGHT

16:54.733 --> 16:56.367
PREFER TO VISIT INSTEAD.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.333
MOST IRANIANS, HOWEVER, CAN GE

16:58.333 --> 16:59.800
AROUND THIS BY USING WHAT AR

16:59.800 --> 17:03.100
KNOWN AS VPNs, VIRTUAL PRIVATE

17:03.100 --> 17:03.267
NETWORKS

17:03.267 --> 17:04.667
AND IT BASICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO

17:04.667 --> 17:06.000
CREATE YOUR OWN SMALL INTERNET

17:06.000 --> 17:07.033
OUT OF YOUR OWN COMPUTER

17:07.033 --> 17:09.200
IT ALLOWS YOU TO BYPASS A LOT OF

17:09.200 --> 17:10.333
THESE RESTRICTIONS

17:10.333 --> 17:11.500
THE LOGIC BEHIND THE

17:11.500 --> 17:12.933
GOVERNMENT'S CENSORSHIP OF THE

17:12.933 --> 17:14.267
INTERNET ISN'T TOTALLY CLEAR AND

17:14.267 --> 17:16.133
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE SENSE

17:16.133 --> 17:17.267
SOMETIMES THERE'S SOME STRANGE

17:17.267 --> 17:19.000
INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WAY THE

17:19.000 --> 17:20.133
ENFORCE IT

17:20.133 --> 17:22.100
FOR EXAMPLE, NPR IS BLOCKED.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.567
BUT PBS ISN'T.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.500
NBC NEWS IS NOT BLOCKED.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.767
ABC NEWS IS.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.500
SO IT'S SOMETIMES HARD T

17:29.500 --> 17:30.333
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S GOIN

17:30.333 --> 17:30.700
ON THERE

17:30.700 --> 17:32.233
>> I READ THAT SOCIAL MEDI

17:32.233 --> 17:32.700
SITES LIKE TWITTER AND FACEBOO

17:32.700 --> 17:34.900
ARE CENSORED AS WELL

17:34.900 --> 17:36.467
>> Reporter: THE IRONY ABOUT

17:36.467 --> 17:37.567
BLOCKING TWITTER AND FACEBOOK IN

17:37.567 --> 17:41.400
IRAN IS THAT THE CURRENT

17:41.400 --> 17:43.633
ADMINISTRATION, ROUHANI'

17:43.633 --> 17:44.300
ADMINISTRATION, ARE SOME OF TH

17:44.300 --> 17:47.067
MOST ACTIVE USERS OF SOCIA

17:47.067 --> 17:48.467
NETWORKS AMONG THE GOVERNMENT IN

17:48.467 --> 17:49.933
THE PAST

17:49.933 --> 17:51.733
ROUHANI HAS AN ACTIVE TWITTE

17:51.733 --> 17:53.000
ACCOUNT, THE FOREIGN MINISTE

17:53.000 --> 17:54.833
HAS A FACEBOOK PAGE, THEY'RE

17:54.833 --> 17:56.200
CONSTANTLY POSTING MESSAGES ON

17:56.200 --> 17:56.667
THERE.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.533
A GUY NAMED JACK DORSEY, ONE O

17:59.533 --> 18:02.000
THE FOUNDERS OF TWITTER, HE SENT

18:02.000 --> 18:04.833
PRESIDENT ROUHANI A TWEET SAYING

18:04.833 --> 18:05.900
BASICALLY, MR. PRESIDENT, GLAD

18:05.900 --> 18:07.033
YOU'RE USING TWITTER, BUT CA

18:07.033 --> 18:08.367
THE PEOPLE OF IRAN ACTUALLY READ

18:08.367 --> 18:11.567
YOUR TWEETS?

18:11.567 --> 18:14.500
PRESIDENT ROUHANI IN HIS STYLE

18:14.500 --> 18:16.033
WROTE BACK VERY CASUALLY, GOOD

18:16.033 --> 18:17.700
EVENING, JACK, IN A TWEET, THE

18:17.700 --> 18:18.333
BASICALLY DIDN'T ANSWER TH

18:18.333 --> 18:18.600
QUESTION

18:18.600 --> 18:19.767
>> WHAT'S BEHIND THE

18:19.767 --> 18:20.267
GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE TO CENSO

18:20.267 --> 18:22.800
SOCIAL MEDIA

18:22.800 --> 18:24.300
>> Reporter: SOME BELIEVE THAT

18:24.300 --> 18:27.100
THE CENSORSHIP OF THESE SOCIAL

18:27.100 --> 18:27.933
NETWORKING SITES IN PARTICULAR

18:27.933 --> 18:29.567
STEM FROM THE 2009 PROTEST

18:29.567 --> 18:32.933
WHICH TOOK PLACE ALL OVER IRAN

18:32.933 --> 18:35.600
AFTER PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD'

18:35.600 --> 18:36.867
LAST HEAVILY CONTESTED ELECTION.

18:36.867 --> 18:37.900
AND TWITTER ESPECIALLY WAS USE

18:37.900 --> 18:40.300
TO HELP GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT

18:40.300 --> 18:41.600
RALLIES AND MARCHES AND EVENTS

18:41.600 --> 18:42.867
IT'S BELIEVED THAT PART OF THE

18:42.867 --> 18:44.233
GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE TO CENSO

18:44.233 --> 18:46.367
THE INTERNET IS SO THAT THEY CAN

18:46.367 --> 18:48.200
STOP THAT KIND OF -- WHAT THEY

18:48.200 --> 18:49.333
THINK OF AS DISSENT FROM GETTING

18:49.333 --> 18:50.067
OUT THERE.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.167
>> YOU SAID YOU MET A MAN THER

18:52.167 --> 18:53.367
WHO WAS PART OF THOSE PROTESTS

18:53.367 --> 18:56.967
>> Reporter: SAID LELAZ, A

18:56.967 --> 18:58.567
PROMINENT IRANIAN ECONOMIST AN

18:58.567 --> 18:58.800
JOURNALIST

18:58.800 --> 19:00.900
WE WENT TO TALK TO HIM

19:00.900 --> 19:02.167
PRINCIPALLY TO TALK ABOUT TH

19:02.167 --> 19:03.300
IMPACT OF SANCTIONS ON THE

19:03.300 --> 19:05.100
ECONOMY.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.267
BUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, SAID WA

19:07.267 --> 19:09.000
ALSO INVOLVED IN ELECTIO

19:09.000 --> 19:10.533
PROTESTS AND HE WAS CONVICTED BY

19:10.533 --> 19:11.167
AHMADINEJAD'S GOVERNMENT AND

19:11.167 --> 19:16.200
SENT TO THE NOTORIOUS EBEN

19:16.200 --> 19:18.367
PRISON, WHICH LOOMS LARGE IN THE

19:18.367 --> 19:20.133
IRANIAN IMAGINATION, IT WAS

19:20.133 --> 19:27.867
PRISON BUILT BY THE SHAH, PEOPLE

19:27.867 --> 19:30.567
HAVE BEEN EXECUTED AND TORTURED.

19:32.467 --> 19:34.267
PRISON, INCLUDING SOLITARY

19:34.267 --> 19:35.600
CONFINEMENT, IN A VERY SMALL

19:35.600 --> 19:35.800
CELL

19:35.800 --> 19:37.233
AT THE END OF OUR INTERVIEW WE

19:37.233 --> 19:38.667
WENT TO HIS PRACTITIONER AND O

19:38.667 --> 19:41.367
THE WALL WE SAW THIS WOODE

19:41.367 --> 19:41.500
CARVING.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.133
SAID TOLD US THIS WAS A GIFT,

19:44.133 --> 19:46.067
HANDMADE GIFT, FROM A PRISONER

19:46.067 --> 19:47.333
HE MET INSIDE PRISON

19:47.333 --> 19:48.867
AND HE TOOK IT DOWN OFF THE WALL

19:48.867 --> 19:48.900
AND HE READ THE INSCRIPTION TO

19:48.900 --> 19:51.100
US

19:51.100 --> 19:52.567
IT SAYS, "AS YOU PASS THROUG

19:52.567 --> 19:55.167
THIS DESERT OF TERROR, PASS IT

WHEN YOU REACH THE BLOSSOMS AN

19:57.433 --> 20:00.267
THE RAIN, GIVE THEM OU

20:06.367 --> 20:06.433
EVERYONE FROM A PRISONER INSID

20:06.433 --> 20:08.567
ONE OF IRAN'S NOTORIOUS PRISONS.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.267
>> HAVE YOU SEEN OR FELT

20:10.267 --> 20:10.900
ANTI-AMERICANISM WHILE YOU'V

20:10.900 --> 20:11.733
BEEN THERE

20:11.733 --> 20:12.800
>> Reporter: NO.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.467
NONE AT ALL.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.400
OUR INTERACTIONS WITH IRANIANS

20:16.400 --> 20:18.500
ACROSS THE BOARD HAVE BEEN

20:18.500 --> 20:19.233
OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.

20:19.233 --> 20:20.733
PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY CURIOUS

20:20.733 --> 20:21.400
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.567
THERE'S JUST NOT THAT MANY

20:22.567 --> 20:23.600
WESTERNERS THAT COME THROUGH

20:23.600 --> 20:23.733
HERE

20:23.733 --> 20:25.767
ESPECIALLY AMERICANS

20:25.767 --> 20:27.800
SO WE'RE KIND OF VIEWED AS A BIT

20:27.800 --> 20:29.033
OF A RARE BIRD HERE.

20:29.033 --> 20:30.367
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, WHAT IS

20:30.367 --> 20:31.167
AMERICA LIKE

20:31.167 --> 20:32.900
WHAT DOES AMERICA THINK OF IRAN?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.100
THEY WANT TO OFFER THEIR

20:35.100 --> 20:36.500
IMPRESSIONS AND SO -- OU

20:36.500 --> 20:37.767
INTERACTIONS HAVE BEEN

20:37.767 --> 20:39.100
INCREDIBLY POSITIVE.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.467
THE FEW INSTANCES THAT YOU D

20:40.467 --> 20:41.933
SEE IT, AND I THINK IT DOE

20:41.933 --> 20:43.700
EXIST IN IRANIAN SOCIETY, WE

20:43.700 --> 20:45.400
JUST HAVEN'T COME ACROSS IT.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.700
THE FEW INSTANCES WHERE WE'V

20:46.700 --> 20:48.867
SOON TOUCHES OF IT ARE IN THES

20:48.867 --> 20:50.400
MORE OFFICIAL VERSIONS OF IT

20:50.400 --> 20:51.933
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE MURAL

20:51.933 --> 20:52.933
ALL OVER TEHRAN.

20:52.933 --> 20:54.400
YOU SEE THESE FACES EVERYWHERE

20:54.400 --> 20:56.067
YOU GO, LOOKING DOWN ON YOU.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.533
HUGE, HUGE FACES

20:57.533 --> 20:59.433
MOST OF THEM ARE EITHER TH

20:59.433 --> 21:01.800
AYATOLLAHS, THE FORMER O

21:01.800 --> 21:02.100
CURRENT.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.167
INTELLECTUAL LEADERS OF TH

21:03.167 --> 21:04.700
ISLAMIC REVOLUTION

21:04.700 --> 21:08.300
OR HEROES OF THE 1980s IRAN/IRAQ

21:08.300 --> 21:09.567
WAR, VOLUNTEERS OR FAMIL

21:09.567 --> 21:12.533
MEMBERS WHO WENT TO FIGHT TH

21:12.533 --> 21:12.800
IRAQIS

21:12.800 --> 21:14.900
THE ONLY MURAL THAT I SAW THAT

21:14.900 --> 21:16.567
HAD ONE TOUCH OF

21:16.567 --> 21:19.600
ANTI-AMERICANISM WAS THIS ONE.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.467
IN IT, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BACK

21:22.467 --> 21:23.400
TO BACK WITH ONE OF THE SORT O

21:23.400 --> 21:26.300
MOST FAMOUS VILLAINS FROM SHIITE

21:26.300 --> 21:26.533
ISLAM.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.167
THIS IS A GUY WHO IS BELIEVED TO
