JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
President Trump hosted South
Korea's new president at the

00:04.566 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House today, the first
meeting between the two leaders,
who are looking for a common

00:09.566 --> 00:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approach to dealing
with North Korea.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

00:14.166 --> 00:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Moon Jae-in arrived at the White
House with tensions over North

00:18.733 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korea still running high.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Rose Garden, President
Trump pressed again for ending
the North's nuclear and weapons

00:25.700 --> 00:27.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programs.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
The era of strategic
patience with the North

00:30.933 --> 00:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korean regime has failed.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many years, and it's failed.

00:35.900 --> 00:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, frankly, that
patience is over.

00:40.066 --> 00:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're working closely with
South Korea and Japan as well
as partners around the world

00:44.600 --> 00:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a range of diplomatic
security and economic
measures to protect
our allies and our own

00:54.133 --> 00:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citizens from this menace
known as North Korea.

00:58.900 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: North
Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has
already test-launched more than

01:03.833 --> 01:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a dozen missiles this
year, all in defiance of
international sanctions.

01:10.833 --> 01:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korea President Moon has
long advocated for diplomatic
engagement with Pyongyang.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since taking office just
last month, he's delayed full
deployment of the U.S. THAAD

01:20.166 --> 01:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anti-missile defense
system in his country.

01:22.600 --> 01:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, though, he warned
of a stern response
to any provocations.

01:26.266 --> 01:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President (through translator):
The North Korean nuclear issue

01:29.633 --> 01:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
must be resolved, without fail.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I also urge Pyongyang
to promptly return to
the negotiating table
for denuclearization

01:37.233 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Korean Peninsula.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and I
will employ both sanctions
and dialogue in a
phased and comprehensive

01:42.300 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approach.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And based on this, we both
pledged to seek a fundamental
resolution of the North Korean

01:47.366 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear problem.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
the U.S. has sought China's
help in trying to rein in North

01:52.966 --> 01:55.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

01:55.666 --> 01:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, yesterday, the
administration announced
sanctions against Chinese
companies and individuals

02:00.500 --> 02:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over their alleged illicit
dealings with North Korea.

02:02.633 --> 02:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But U.S. officials insisted
they weren't targeting
the Chinese government.

02:06.700 --> 02:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, neither President
Trump nor President
Moon mentioned China.

02:11.400 --> 02:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a different subject,
Mr. Trump again criticized
the U.S. trade deficit
with South Korea, and

02:17.600 --> 02:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blamed a 2011 free trade
deal for the imbalance.

02:20.833 --> 02:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called for new action
to reduce trade barriers
between the two countries.

02:24.733 --> 02:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For his part, Moon played
down the trade issue.

02:27.866 --> 02:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he announced that the
president and Mrs. Trump have
accepted his invitation to visit

02:32.633 --> 02:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
South Korea later this year.

02:34.666 --> 02:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, where do things
stand between the U.S.
and South Korea, and
how will the two nations

02:38.933 --> 02:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with the North?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For that, we turn
to Robert Gallucci.

02:42.466 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the chief U.S. negotiator
back in 1994 when the Clinton
administration persuaded

02:49.833 --> 02:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the North Koreans to dismantle
their plutonium-based
nuclear program in exchange
for economic benefits.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is now a professor
at Georgetown University
and chair of the U.S.
Korea Institute at Johns

02:58.533 --> 02:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hopkins University.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

03:01.200 --> 03:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI, Georgetown
University: Thanks very much.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
today's meeting between Moon and
Trump will help forge a clearer

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan for how to deal
with North Korea?

03:07.500 --> 03:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I think today's
meeting is a success, in the
sense that the United States

03:14.266 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end and the South Koreans
clearly indicated that they
value the alliance very much and

03:18.066 --> 03:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the alliance is important
to the security of both our
countries and the stability of

03:23.666 --> 03:25.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northeast Asia.

03:25.733 --> 03:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The way you framed that
question, that it's
going to lead to the
resolution of the issue

03:29.766 --> 03:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with North Korea, is a
bit of a reach from at
least what I could take
away from the meeting.

03:34.366 --> 03:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You
and several other former
Cabinet officials and
senators wrote a letter

03:38.533 --> 03:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Trump administration
where you urged that they take
direct immediate talks with

03:45.366 --> 03:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the North Koreans, possibly
send a high-ranking
envoy to North Korea,.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think
that's a good idea?

03:50.500 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: For
a variety of reasons.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that people who favor
negotiations do so partly
because the alternatives are

03:58.066 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
miserable.

04:00.266 --> 04:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are fundamentally
three options in dealing
with North Korea, and
there always have been

04:04.033 --> 04:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the end of the Korean War.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One is to contain
the North Koreans.

04:09.633 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have been doing that,
and we have done it for decades.

04:12.166 --> 04:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have been doing that
actually for the eight years
of the Obama administration.

04:15.300 --> 04:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would say that was a
containment or strategic
patience type of policy.

04:20.033 --> 04:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem with containment is
that it doesn't stop with North
Koreans from developing assets

04:24.766 --> 04:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and capabilities and threat that
we would rather they not have.

04:28.233 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a second option is to
negotiate and to see whether we
cannot reach an agreement with

04:35.200 --> 04:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the North Koreans where they
agree to give up a capability
which we believe they shouldn't

04:39.500 --> 04:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have and is threatening
to friends and allies.

04:42.533 --> 04:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what we attempted
to do in 1994 with
the agreed framework.

04:47.066 --> 04:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A third option is to use
military force, something
which we are proud
always to say is on the

04:53.000 --> 04:54.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
table, something
we haven't done.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, by that, we do not mean
launching another Korean War.

04:57.766 --> 05:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We mean the use of military
force in some limited way
to attack the capability.

05:04.766 --> 05:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's not only the
nuclear weapons, but it's those
long-range, ICBM-range ballistic

05:07.700 --> 05:10.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missiles.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your
letter, though, you're
clearly arguing for
point two negotiation.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are some people, as
you well know, in the foreign
policy establishment who say

05:16.100 --> 05:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you cannot negotiate
with the North Koreans.

05:18.466 --> 05:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just curious
how you respond to that.

05:20.533 --> 05:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I think
it's a fair thing to
say that negotiations
with the North Koreans

05:25.933 --> 05:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not guaranteed to succeed.

05:27.966 --> 05:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, certainly, through
the years of the Bush
administration, Bush
43, the 2000s, there

05:34.433 --> 05:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were many efforts by
very capable people to
negotiate with the North
Koreans, and it didn't

05:39.133 --> 05:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
produce very much.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even the agreement
which stuck for eight
years, the agreed framework
I mentioned before,

05:46.566 --> 05:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuck for a while and stopped
the plutonium program from
producing nuclear weapons.

05:50.366 --> 05:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ultimately, it
collapsed as well.

05:52.566 --> 05:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is reason to say that
negotiations with the North
Koreans are not easy, they

05:57.533 --> 06:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not succeed, but they may
be a way of getting to where
we want to get to, limiting

06:04.566 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the capability of the North
Koreans to do harm to us and
our allies without the use

06:09.566 --> 06:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of military force and
without the risk of a major
war in Northeast Asia.

06:11.700 --> 06:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Chinese
have floated another possible
entreaty to the North Koreans,

06:18.133 --> 06:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's for the U.S. and
the South Koreans to stop these
annual military exercises.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important is that to
the North Koreans and do you
think that that's a good idea?

06:25.666 --> 06:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: The North
Koreans have said frequently
that they are very unhappy about

06:31.533 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S.-ROK military exercises.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do believe they
are unhappy about them.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You actually
had some recent meetings with
North Korean officials and you

06:41.466 --> 06:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heard this very same issue.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: It was the
first thing on their agenda
that they were most concerned

06:46.233 --> 06:48.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

06:48.266 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's interesting about that,
of course, is that, from our
perspective, the alliance

06:51.500 --> 06:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the United States and
Republic of Korea is key to
both our countries' security,

06:56.066 --> 07:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a manifestation of the
strength of that alliance
are those military exercises.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that will be not high on
our agenda to give up easily.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something that might
be on the table, along with
the nuclear weapons program of

07:09.833 --> 07:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the North Koreans?

07:11.266 --> 07:12.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Plausibly.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's pretty
much down the road.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't imagine
negotiations would begin there.

07:16.866 --> 07:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would begin with
talks about talks, I think,
without preconditions.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last night.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you think the Trump
administration has any
interest in any of the
things you're taking

07:24.966 --> 07:26.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about?

07:26.766 --> 07:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I don't
know what the Trump
administration is interested in.

07:29.733 --> 07:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been mentions by the
secretary of state, secretary
of defense and even the

07:36.100 --> 07:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of possibly talking
with the North Koreans.

07:38.333 --> 07:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worry that, in their minds,
are preconditions that will make
negotiations someplace between

07:44.233 --> 07:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difficult and impossible.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Robert
Gallucci, Georgetown University,
thank you very much for being
