10:29.896 --> 10:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything back you know I don't
they're
still assessing their still
riding

10:34.501 --> 10:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around three whores around
actually
assessing and mapping out as its
FEMA so

10:39.939 --> 10:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really do not know just argue
been
crossing mall alone other
developers

10:45.111 --> 10:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell me that he thinks that
somewhere
around 30 million dollar hit the
malls

10:49.816 --> 10:54.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roughly a year and a half two
years old
store still only we're moving
into the

10:54.120 --> 10:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second phase actually the mall
open
that's just one mall so we we've
got

10:59.826 --> 11:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
substantial damage in there

11:01.594 --> 11:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spares what are you how would
you
describe what the main
challenges are

11:06.466 --> 11:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now facing the people around you

11:09.936 --> 11:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what what are you what are you
facing
well I think now we made it
through the

11:14.274 --> 11:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescue phase we moved into the
recovery
phase now the the hardest part
is going

11:19.445 --> 11:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be trying to get people some
help to
get him back in their homes
which were

11:23.917 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
severely damaged in one way or
another
by the flood it could be
anywhere from 2

11:27.587 --> 11:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inches to 8 9 10 feet in some
areas so
that the real problem is and we
also

11:34.961 --> 11:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have schools that were damaged
so the
real problem challenging it is
to try to

11:39.065 --> 11:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get these people back to their
homes
quick with it we can so that the
kids

11:43.536 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can get back into the schools
once they
open so there's some sort of
normalcy

11:46.940 --> 11:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there so we're hoping to have
you know
what certainly will be assessed
and

11:50.677 --> 11:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to do that anyway we can
but
that's going to be a long
drawn-out slow

11:55.181 --> 12:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process because most people that
were
severely affected by the flood
also lost

12:00.353 --> 12:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their vehicles so we've got to
get
vehicles commercials are down
there not

12:04.691 --> 12:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up and running they're not
working yet
so they don't have a job to go
to so

12:08.728 --> 12:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've got we've got quite a mess
right
now

12:11.130 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so what sort of outside help do
you need
from the federal government or
anybody

12:15.568 --> 12:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
else and do you think you're
getting it

12:17.637 --> 12:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well you know FEMA has really
stepped up
to this point on man that was

12:21.641 --> 12:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administrator Craig Fugate last
week
with like governor Edwards and
his staff

12:25.812 --> 12:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the governor's office it was
a very
good meeting how they assured us
of any

12:30.183 --> 12:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asset that we need to ask for it
would
happen and so far it has about
what i

12:35.521 --> 12:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really need right now which
would be
really great for our parish and

12:39.225 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounding prayer shoes is for
the
president to declare this a 9010
payback

12:44.030 --> 12:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for FEMA vs 2575 that would help
us in
government all across the state

12:49.902 --> 12:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tremendously with an enormous
impact
this storm has had he can do
that and i

12:55.908 --> 13:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope you will will will do that
very
soon because what that means is
the past

13:00.513 --> 13:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willow back ten percent purchase
the
25-percent I quite frankly don't
know

13:05.084 --> 13:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the 10-percent going to
come from
but I know twenty-five percent
right now

13:09.222 --> 13:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it's just gonna be astronaut
oh well
as we reported the president was
there

13:14.894 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in

13:16.529 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
baton rouge today there's also
been some
political criticism that you can
get

13:19.499 --> 13:21.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there sooner

13:21.234 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how do you see that we know
Donald Trump
was there last Friday what it
one of

13:26.773 --> 13:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these visits mean for the area
and did
the did the politicians get
there as

13:32.045 --> 13:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soon as you thought they should
have you
know it in in in in my as far as
I'm

13:37.083 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned yes I didn't need him
to come
in the middle of this thing at
the heat

13:41.788 --> 13:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the battle last week what I
needed to
do that was to declare a state
of

13:45.391 --> 13:46.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emergency

13:46.926 --> 13:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he did that our fingers wrapped
up
really fast under government and
words

13:50.797 --> 13:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone with as an administrator
Craig
Fugate they were signing off on

13:55.535 --> 13:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decorations happens get the
assets that
we needed at that time and also

13:59.672 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
initially that's what i needed
out of
the federal government

14:03.176 --> 14:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel like we got that the
argument
about whether or not he should
have come

14:07.113 --> 14:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last week quite frankly my
opinion had
he come in the middle of this
thing last

14:10.817 --> 14:14.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week we would've been pulling
our first
responders away from where they
needed

14:14.454 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the assets that we used to
rescue
people and then to handle the
shelter's

14:19.525 --> 14:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to make sure he was safe
while he
came into our parish of so I
felt like

14:25.665 --> 14:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was ok not coming last week I
do
think he should've made a couple
of

14:28.901 --> 14:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phone calls to us that would've
been
nice to at least hurt from him

14:32.672 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
however its fourth really
getting things
done for me that i needed i feel
like he

14:36.943 --> 14:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did that all the governor's
office has
been extremely extremely helpful
looks

14:41.581 --> 14:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's made a big difference
now him
coming this week today I'm
disappointed

14:46.719 --> 14:48.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he didn't call

14:48.287 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm disappointed that he didn't
come
over into our parents it's our
parish

14:51.057 --> 14:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the one that was most
severely hit
but again however as far as him

14:55.628 --> 14:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directing FEMA I think they're
doing all
they can do for us at this point
but

14:59.999 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this is a long drawn-out
recovery
process i'm going to need FEMA
for a

15:04.837 --> 15:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long time to come to help make
sure that
we're going to be able to get
this done

15:09.208 --> 15:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for our people and that then the
parents
will be made whole or as much so
as we

15:13.513 --> 15:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can I in the aftermath of this
late in
Rick's who is the president of

15:18.885 --> 15:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
livingston parish in Louisiana
we thank
you very much and we certainly
wish you

15:23.222 --> 15:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the very best with the recovery
that's
that's coming in the weeks and
months to

15:27.827 --> 15:28.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come

15:28.528 --> 15:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you ma'am I appreciate you

15:42.708 --> 15:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now to the 2016 presidential
campaign
the vast amount of attention in
this

15:47.713 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election year by far has gone to
the two
main party nominees for
president

15:52.518 --> 15:56.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
but
there are a few third-party
candidates

15:56.856 --> 16:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
competing as well tonight we
hear from
the woman who is the nominee of
the

16:00.693 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Green Party for the second
election in a
row

16:04.063 --> 16:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she is dr. jill stein and I
spoke with
her a short time ago dr. jill
stein

16:09.435 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
welcome to the NewsHour great to
be with
you to tea so let me just start
by

16:13.573 --> 16:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking you what is the main
difference
between what you and the Green
Party

16:18.044 --> 16:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer voters and from what say
Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders have
offered

16:22.682 --> 16:29.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so maybe the main difference is
that i'm
the one candidate in the race
that is

16:29.422 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not corrupted by lobbyists money
by
corporate money or by super PAC
so on

16:35.795 --> 16:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one candidate that can
really stand
up for what it is that American
people

16:40.132 --> 16:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are really clamoring for and
that means
jobs and an emergency jobs
program we

16:45.771 --> 16:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call for the creation of 20
million jobs
to solve the emergency of
climate change

16:51.010 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we call for one hundred
percent
clean renewable energy by 2030
we call

16:57.884 --> 17:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for canceling student debt and
you know
the Hillary and and now Bernie
talked

17:05.091 --> 17:10.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about free public higher
education going
forward but not dealing with his
burden

17:10.930 --> 17:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of debt which has really locked
a
generation into kind of a
hopeless

17:15.434 --> 17:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future right now and we also
call for
free public higher and I feel
free

17:22.708 --> 17:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public higher education right
and for
health care is a human right and
i think

17:26.679 --> 17:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we differ on foreign policy i
mean let
me just stop you there with with

17:30.616 --> 17:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic policy because you
didn't get
jobs program for anyone who
doesn't get

17:34.687 --> 17:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one in the private sector the
government
should provide it for giving
student

17:39.125 --> 17:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loans you talk about free
childcare free
healthcare medicare-for-all how
much is

17:44.130 --> 17:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that going to cost how do
you pay
for it so fortunately most of it
pays

17:48.134 --> 17:49.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for itself

17:49.468 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so for example providing jobs to
transform our economy

17:55.341 --> 17:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the green energy economy of
the
future

17:58.711 --> 18:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it actually gets rid of what's
causing
200,000 premature deaths a year
that is

18:04.517 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through fossil fuels it turns
out we get
so much healthier when we
convert to a

18:09.555 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
green energy economy that our
health
savings alone are enough to pay
for the

18:14.660 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cost of the energy transition so
it
wouldn't require say a tax hike
maybe

18:20.800 --> 18:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even it attacks hike for those
in the
middle class so the other piece
of this

18:25.037 --> 18:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that moving to 100% renewable
energy
means we no longer need and can
no

18:31.177 --> 18:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer justify wars for oil
which mind
you have cost us six trillion
dollars

18:36.716 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 2001 when you include the
cost of
caring for our wounded soldiers
67

18:42.521 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
awards for that's right words
for oil
because we've been fighting
these regime

18:46.892 --> 18:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change wars which are not making
us
safer in fact arguably we are
much less

18:52.698 --> 18:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
safe with each new war on terror

18:56.035 --> 19:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we actually have created a new
wave of
even more difficult terror so we
call

19:01.307 --> 19:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for actually a weapons and parco
and
freezing the funding of our
allies who

19:06.645 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are sponsoring terrorist
enterprises
around the world according to
Hillary

19:11.183 --> 19:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's own leaked emails are
from the
secretary's office so we cutting
our

19:16.722 --> 19:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military budget which is one
thing we
can do when we are 100-percent

19:21.494 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renewables and heading for it
enables us
to bring hundreds of billions of
dollars

19:25.898 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back into true security here in
our own
economy

19:30.469 --> 19:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well I want to ask you about the
military as well because you
would cut

19:33.472 --> 19:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you said the military budget in
half you
would close down many if not all

19:38.577 --> 19:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overseas US bases you said you
would cut
aid to us important US allies
like

19:43.816 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel like Egypt and Saudi
Arabia so do
you see the United States
pulling back

19:49.622 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not really playing a global
role
actually I see us playing more
of a

19:53.759 --> 19:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global role and more impactful
global
role because we would have a
consistent

19:59.598 --> 20:05.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy it's not about
specifically
defunding Israel or Saudi Arabia
or

20:05.137 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Egypt it's about having a nice

20:06.972 --> 20:11.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and handed policy that says that
we as
the united states with all due
humility

20:11.444 --> 20:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are asking our allies to turn
over a new
page where our foreign policy is
based

20:17.450 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on international law and human
rights
and that we will not sponsor the

20:22.855 --> 20:27.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governments of countries or
their
militaries where they are
systematically

20:27.560 --> 20:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more importantly violating
human
rights and international law
very

20:32.631 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly if Russia say went into
Eastern
Europe with the u.s. respond if
you were

20:36.769 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president um you know the laws
of war
right now say that we can
respond when

20:42.441 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our country is threatened that
is you
know what international law says
so we

20:47.780 --> 20:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would need to establish that
there is
actually imminent danger to the
United

20:52.384 --> 20:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States I don't North Korea going
into
South Korea the same thing if
that's not

20:56.155 --> 21:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imminent danger to the united
states in
the US would necessary well what
we

21:00.993 --> 21:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be doing is trying to
preempt
these conflicts before they
occur

21:04.563 --> 21:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through a vigorous policy of
engagement
so we would be sitting down to
negotiate

21:11.637 --> 21:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to actually reduce conflict on
the
Korean Peninsula right now
because

21:17.009 --> 21:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's never really been a
ceasefire or
there's been a cease-fire but
there

21:21.080 --> 21:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't been a formalization of
the war
on the Korean Peninsula that's
right

21:25.217 --> 21:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just i also want to ask you
about as you
know your campaign is drawn
parallels

21:29.455 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with ralph nader in two thousand
virgins
early everybody has researched
that

21:34.660 --> 21:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election say that Ralph Nader
who got
over what 97,000 votes in the
state of

21:40.232 --> 21:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida cost al gore the state
Al Gore
lost the state by 537 votes so
my

21:46.872 --> 21:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question is if this race gets
close

21:49.875 --> 21:55.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why isn't it a safe to assume
that
you're prepared to see Hillary
Clinton

21:55.080 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lose to Donald Trump because
most of
your vote should count assault

21:58.717 --> 22:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well you know I think it remains
to be
seen where our votes would come
from

22:01.787 --> 22:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remember the majority of Donald
Trump
supporters don't actually
support him

22:06.725 --> 22:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're mainly motivated by not
liking
Hillary Clinton so how about we
give

22:10.963 --> 22:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those dissatisfied Clinton you
know
opponents someone else that they
can

22:15.601 --> 22:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for in fact many of Bernie
Sanders
supporters let me put this
another way

22:20.706 --> 22:25.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many Trump supporters used to be
Sanders
supporters and when Sanders was
wiped

22:25.778 --> 22:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out they moved over to trump so
we're
trying to bring in you know the
majority

22:30.616 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans were in a very
different
different moment now
historically then

22:35.154 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were in two thousand because
the
majority of American voters have

22:38.524 --> 22:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rejected both Hillary Clinton
and Donald
Trump they're the most disliked
an

22:43.229 --> 22:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
untrusted candidates for
president in
our history and the American
people are

22:47.366 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clamoring for another choice i
think and
before we try to shut down the

22:51.537 --> 22:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussion it's really important
you
know to let that discussion go
forward

22:56.141 --> 23:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and let people see you know I
think in
America just ask you that you
you've

23:00.446 --> 23:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made it clear you think both
Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump would
be

23:03.949 --> 23:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrible presidents but the
country so
are you saying you think
literally that

23:07.653 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is every bit as
bad for
the country as Donald trunk i
went there

23:12.024 --> 23:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today there are no differences
but the
differences are not enough to
save your

23:16.061 --> 23:17.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job

23:17.796 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we feel that in this election
we're not
just deciding what kind of a
world we're

23:21.000 --> 23:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have that whether we're
going
to have a world are not going
forward

23:24.336 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and knowing that the majority of
Americans is unhappy with these
two

23:28.274 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
party choices

23:29.875 --> 23:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the time for us to open
up so
we're pushing for opening up the
debates

23:33.646 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then let's see how the chips
fall

investigation examines the use
of

24:20.092 --> 24:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporal or physical punishment
in
public schools and that is the

our weekly education segment
making the
grade

24:27.666 --> 24:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the practice is far less common
than it
used to be but a report in the
journal

24:31.570 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
education week finds it is still
utilized in 21 states and more
than

24:37.009 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
100,000 children were physically
punished in one recent year

24:42.081 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proponents say it can be an
effective
way to motivate children to
behave but

24:46.819 --> 24:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much research suggests otherwise

24:49.555 --> 24:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we begin with a story of a
nineteen-year-old in Mississippi
Trey

24:53.225 --> 24:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clayton was paddled repeatedly
in high
school because of discipline
problems

24:58.330 --> 25:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the piece was produced by our
partners
at education week Mississippi
leads the

nation in the percentage of
schools that
use corporal punishment name is
Trey

25:07.740 --> 25:13.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clayton i'm 19 now my paddle and
took
place in defense has school 8th
grade

25:13.679 --> 25:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school is fun got along with
everybody

25:18.217 --> 25:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a good student I didn't do
my
schoolwork and do my homework
but no I

25:25.491 --> 25:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did get my test i guess i was
happy said
school was playing football a
lot of

25:31.864 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years in school get in trouble
they
caught with cigarette arguing
people

25:37.269 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to fight people and stuff
mouth
lot

25:42.207 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't really like it too old to
do but
if I had the choice to get
paddling I

25:48.313 --> 25:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
usually choose palin just get
out with
they didn't want to spend time
and in

25:54.153 --> 25:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school suspension is or because
my
parents always told me you know

25:59.491 --> 26:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't ever choose suspension you
know
could you don't need you can't
miss

26:04.062 --> 26:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school going to miss school just
like
any other day I'm in trouble my
buddy's

26:08.901 --> 26:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in trouble so we're talking
library and
start no telling us to hush i
just had

26:14.440 --> 26:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something smart to say back and
but i
know i was going to get pattern
shows

26:20.078 --> 26:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
palette so I get three licks it
to
escort me in class we walk in
his office

26:27.820 --> 26:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to walk around them and
just woke
up on the floor I felt something
in my

26:32.391 --> 26:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mouth and I start now hold my
hand out
to see what is start spitting
out teeth

26:37.596 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like shards of my teeth

26:40.132 --> 26:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've been a bit through both
sides of
the tongue I've got one tre
Mason and my

26:47.139 --> 26:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daughter and mouth statewide
shut for
six weeks when all this happened
was

26:55.981 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken with a call nine weeks
test and in
the middle of them is what
always

27:02.521 --> 27:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens so I never finished them
they
never gave me the opportunity to
retake

27:07.493 --> 27:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it fell down for that you
when I had
to go back to the eighth grade
at the

27:13.098 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same school

27:14.766 --> 27:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just didn't go to school much
and i
felt again until filing I was
just like

27:20.472 --> 27:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no sense to me staying you know
doing
this well have kero and
one-year-old now

27:28.981 --> 27:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two-year-old is not mine but
take
care of as she is mine but

27:36.054 --> 27:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
i love i love their i do believe
in
discipline nothing i do believe
they

27:43.128 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need to know what's right what's
wrong

27:45.597 --> 27:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what happened to me I
wouldn't won't
happen to them I wouldn't want
them to

27:52.037 --> 27:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with that tray Clayton's
family filed
a lawsuit against the school
district

27:58.443 --> 28:02.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but they lost the family
eventually
dropped the case the current
school

28:02.581 --> 28:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
superintendent in that district
says
corporal punishment is still use
their

28:06.585 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that it's quote used very
judiciously now

28:10.188 --> 28:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jeffrey Brown has a closer look
at all
of this with sarah sparks of the

28:14.059 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education week team series barks
welcome
to I think a lot of people would
be

28:19.398 --> 28:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprised at the continuing
prevalence
of this and were you and your
colleagues

28:23.335 --> 28:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were a little surprised at
how many
states are still using corporal

28:28.373 --> 28:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
punishment we found 21 states
and more
than 4,000 schools were using
physical

28:35.213 --> 28:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discipline all different age
levels
grade levels

28:38.183 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
absolutely we found from
kindergarten
all the way up through high
school there

28:43.655 --> 28:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were at least some students at
every
level also surprising and
notable in

28:48.293 --> 28:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your stories where how much
policies can
and do vary state to state and
even

28:54.466 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within states right in some
districts it
was even school-by-school
differences

29:00.472 --> 29:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is no official training
not much
guidance and not a whole lot of

29:07.713 --> 29:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accountability on how corporal
punishment gets meted out what
about law

29:14.019 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have 29 states who have
outlawed
corporal punishment 21 allow it
to some

29:20.192 --> 29:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree or another and from state
to
state the policies and practices
differ

29:26.932 --> 29:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tremendously so define terms
here what
do we mean by corporal
punishment we use

29:34.539 --> 29:40.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the federal government's
definition
which is generally paddling
spanking any

29:40.078 --> 29:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
physical discipline that is done
to a
child did you find other kinds
of

29:44.650 --> 29:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
punishment we did the data set
that we

29:48.920 --> 29:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used doesn't differentiate by
what
implement gets used we found
everything

29:54.893 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from handling with a 20 inch
wooden
paddle to some cases of chemical
spray

30:03.135 --> 30:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or even a Taser and we should
say the
data comes from the federal
government

30:06.672 --> 30:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right civil rights right this is
the
most recent civil rights data
from the

30:11.810 --> 30:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Education Department it's for
the
2013-14 school year

30:15.981 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you also found the data a
disproportionate cases involved

30:21.053 --> 30:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
african-american children and
lower
income children right I was very

30:24.723 --> 30:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surprised that black students
were twice
as likely as white students to

30:30.028 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience corporal punishment
if you're
in a state that uses corporal
punishment

30:35.701 --> 30:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and your low-income you were
also
significantly more likely to be
in a

30:40.639 --> 30:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school that uses it so in the
case of a
student like Trey Clayton we so
we saw

30:45.777 --> 30:47.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the video

30:47.412 --> 30:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you see that as a special
case or as
a typical it's typical of the
risks of

30:53.852 --> 30:56.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using corporal punishment in
schools

30:56.822 --> 31:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trey Clayton said that his
corporal
punishment was a little more
severe than

31:02.894 --> 31:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was used to but trade been
paddled
many times in school before and
we just

31:09.835 --> 31:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know what made him pass
out in his
case that incident the arguments
that

31:17.743 --> 31:24.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you often heard in favor of this
are
that it's an alternative to
suspension

31:24.282 --> 31:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example right we heard from
from
people who were very much
against

31:30.155 --> 31:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporal punishment all the way
to
people who are defending
corporal

31:32.924 --> 31:38.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
punishment that this is
something that
can be used to get a kid
discipline

31:38.096 --> 31:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly and bring them back to
school
and it's used for everything
from

31:43.368 --> 31:51.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
talking back in class to
fighting in the
halls but the research shows
that in the

31:51.176 --> 31:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long term it can have the exact
opposite
effect that educators think it
will and

31:57.149 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope it will have I mean we have
studies
that find higher aggression
right

32:02.154 --> 32:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's higher defiance of adults
there
isn't a recent neurological
study that

32:07.826 --> 32:13.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
found students who had
experienced
corporal punishment several
times over

32:13.298 --> 32:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time had lower brain matter in
the part
of the brain associated with

32:18.904 --> 32:20.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
self-control

32:20.572 --> 32:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so there are some negative side
effects
to this and and are our people
in places

32:25.877 --> 32:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they're doing this aware
of that
or what was their reaction when
you

32:30.248 --> 32:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pointed out the research for the
most
part they weren't aware but also
had a

32:38.256 --> 32:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of this is part of our
community
this is something that we as
educators

32:44.629 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grew up with and the kids that
we've
paddled over the years have
grown up to

32:51.736 --> 32:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be good people so I think
there's a lot
of community support in some of
the

32:58.343 --> 33:02.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
areas that still heavily
practice
corporal punishment let me as
you

33:02.314 --> 33:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finally what what rights if any
do
parents have if they want to
keep their

33:06.384 --> 33:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children from being subjected to
corporal punishment in some
states

33:12.524 --> 33:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parents are allowed to opt their
child
out of corporal punishment but
that

33:17.529 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opt-out doesn't carry the force
of law
and from what we've seen in the
lawsuits

33:24.135 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been brought over the
years
you don't stand a very good
chance in

33:30.075 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court if you are a parent or
student who
feels you were inappropriately
corporal

33:36.281 --> 33:37.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
punished

33:37.682 --> 33:40.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
alright Sarah sparks of
education we
thank you very much thank you

33:51.229 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

33:53.531 --> 33:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a decade the anti-secrecy
website
WikiLeaks has published online
millions

33:59.571 --> 34:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of original documents and other
material
leaks that have exposed the
inner

34:03.909 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
workings of the National
Security Agency
the US military and State
Department the

34:09.347 --> 34:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi government and most
recently the
Democratic National Committee
but a new

34:14.286 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report by The Associated Press
says that
many private individuals are
caught up

34:18.924 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the disclosures william
branham has
more the AP went through a
sampling of

34:24.429 --> 34:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the tens of thousands of
documents
wikileaks released in the last
year and

34:28.199 --> 34:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found many personal details
about
private citizens social security
numbers

34:32.237 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical files sensitive family
and
financial information and what
the AP

34:36.541 --> 34:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calls particularly egregious
wikileaks
published the names of two
teenage rape

34:41.146 --> 34:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victims as well as the name of a
Saudi
citizen had been arrested for
being gay

34:45.050 --> 34:49.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that revelation could endanger
the man's
life because in Saudi Arabia
being gay

34:49.788 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is punishable by death

34:51.489 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joining me now from Paris is
Raphael
Satter one of the AP reporters
who wrote

34:55.360 --> 34:56.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this story

34:57.028 --> 35:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rafael thanks for being here I
wonder if
you could tell us what made you
first

35:00.265 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off want to do this deep dive
into
WikiLeaks in the first place I i
covered

35:05.971 --> 35:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Saudi files release back in
2015 and
there was an enormous amount of

35:11.743 --> 35:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newsworthy information in there
on but
as we were going through the
files with

35:16.881 --> 35:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my colleague Maggie who co-wrote
today's
story we noticed that there was
a lot of

35:21.353 --> 35:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
irrelevant information in there
too
including a few medical files
now at the

35:26.391 --> 35:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time we sort of shrugged it off
we
thought well maybe there are a
couple of

35:30.628 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight files in there but we
flagged
it for for further research and
finally

35:35.533 --> 35:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year we've gone back and
done some
digging

35:38.036 --> 35:41.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we mentioned that there was the
the
mention of the Saudi man had
been

35:41.773 --> 35:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrested for homosexuality what
what
sorts of other things did you
find this

35:46.011 --> 35:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in these documents we found all
kinds of
things if it's personal or
sensitive or

35:52.484 --> 35:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family-related we found it so we
found
details of custody battles we
found a

35:57.756 --> 36:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parent's writing to authorities
about
missing children we found
details of

36:02.127 --> 36:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elopements of divorces of
partners who
had sexually transmitted

36:07.065 --> 36:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diseases partners who had AIDS
people
who were in debt in distress in
all

36:12.637 --> 36:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of financial difficulties
and of
course some of the cases that
you

36:15.740 --> 36:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned earlier that is to say
people
who were raped including
children who

36:19.511 --> 36:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were raped do you have any sense
of why
these documents were released i
mean

36:23.982 --> 36:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this seems to go at odds with
with
WikiLeaks is stands as a
longtime

36:27.552 --> 36:30.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
advocate of privacy for
individuals

36:30.288 --> 36:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why are these types of documents
and
this kind of information
contained in

36:34.159 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there it's difficult to know for
sure i
don't speak for Julian Assange
the head

36:40.265 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of WikiLeaks and I can't say
exactly
what goes into these releases
Assange

36:45.570 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has indeed said that private
information
would be protected in fact he
said

36:49.441 --> 36:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explicitly that his site would
take care
with medical data for whatever
reason

36:53.711 --> 36:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that doesn't appear to have
happened
here and even though I've been
trying to

36:57.215 --> 37:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get in touch with Assange for
the past
couple of weeks he hasn't spoken
to us

37:01.820 --> 37:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or offered us any kind of an
explanation
for why this happened I i know
that in

37:06.191 --> 37:09.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past WikiLeaks has worked
with
journalists who will then go
through

37:09.194 --> 37:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of this information before
it's
released and and redact
information to

37:13.531 --> 37:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to protect people's data do
you
reasons why that didn't happen
in this

37:16.734 --> 37:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case that kind of thing has not
happened
for some time at least not at
any great

37:24.476 --> 37:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scale that indeed happened in
$MONTH
2010 with the release of bradley

37:29.347 --> 37:33.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
manning's US diplomatic
documents that
WikiLeaks would work very
closely with

37:33.218 --> 37:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalists from the New York
Times and
The Guardian and other
publications but

37:37.822 --> 37:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we leak stance on this kind of
thing is
hardened and they now argue that
any

37:42.060 --> 37:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
redactions any reductions at all
kind of
feed the propaganda that
information can

37:48.466 --> 37:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be dangerous and and they're
very much
against that or they say that
they're

37:51.736 --> 37:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very much against that so lately
although i believe there have
been some

37:55.707 --> 38:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reductions left and right
overwhelmingly
the material comes out raw that
is to

38:00.745 --> 38:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say unfiltered we reached out to
WikiLeaks for comment and they
got back

38:04.883 --> 38:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to us and and basically argued
that none
of this is new this information
has been

38:09.254 --> 38:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out there for a while and that
you and
the AP have some kind of animus
against

38:12.991 --> 38:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks and that's why you're
trying
to make a big story out of this
what

38:16.327 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's your response to that
well I've
I've worked with WikiLeaks on

38:20.965 --> 38:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several stories including
stories about
surveillance in Syria and in
fact my

38:27.105 --> 38:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleague Maggie and I covered
the Saudi
cables very aggressively last
year

38:31.409 --> 38:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's one of the reasons we
first came
across these documents and no
one else

38:34.812 --> 38:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did I think that wikileaks has
produced
an enormous amount of newsworthy

38:39.050 --> 38:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
material on but I reject the
idea that
we somehow did this because we
had an

38:43.788 --> 38:46.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
agenda in fact I've been
thinking about
this story for a better part of
the year

38:46.925 --> 38:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the truth is that the fact
that I'm
here right now speaking with you
and and

38:51.529 --> 38:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaking with others of the past
few
hours is a testament to the fact
that

38:55.333 --> 38:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stories in fact quite new
and and I
think very disturbing

39:00.004 --> 39:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's say that I'm someone who's
information it is contained in
these in

39:04.275 --> 39:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this this dump of information is
there
any route for me to appeal to
WikiLeaks

39:09.647 --> 39:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get my private information
taken off
their website that's a great
question on

39:16.354 --> 39:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's a question that we
got a lot
from the people that we got in
touch

39:19.691 --> 39:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with people talk to us in a
panic and
those who would talk to us and
they said

39:25.196 --> 39:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what can I do what are my next
steps

39:27.131 --> 39:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who do I right to who do i call
to get
my information taken off the
site

39:30.935 --> 39:35.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're talking about deeply
private data
like whether or not a bride was

all right Raphael Satter from

much

39:53.057 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thanks for having me

39:56.761 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

40:04.269 --> 40:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reducing the amount of carbon

the atmosphere is a key to
slowing

40:10.041 --> 40:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change scientists based
in
Iceland have made a major
breakthrough

40:14.012 --> 40:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by transforming carbon dioxide
gas or
co2 into rock and the head of
the

40:20.318 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research group says it is
possible that
forty percent of the world's
carbon

40:24.155 --> 40:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dioxide emissions could be dealt
with by
adopting their techniques
special

40:29.460 --> 40:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent Malcolm Brabant
has been
to Iceland to examine this
promising

40:33.498 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discovery and he reports now
it's part
of our breakthrough series

40:41.739 --> 40:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm standing about 1,000 feet of
volcano
that last erupted about 2,000
years ago

40:46.978 --> 40:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the temperature underground here
is
about 620 degrees Fahrenheit
according

40:52.684 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to geologists this volcano could
blow at
any time without could be
anytime within

40:57.889 --> 41:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next 1,000 years the process
of
turning carbon dioxide into rock
is

41:03.628 --> 41:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening about 6,000 feet below
my feet
silently but up here you can
really

41:09.334 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense the visceral power of
Mother
Nature

41:13.071 --> 41:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any sensation I can compare it
to is
being rather close to the launch
of the

41:17.542 --> 41:19.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
space shuttle

41:19.210 --> 41:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is how to say the double
power
plant the thermal energy is
transported

41:23.681 --> 41:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towards reykjavik where we heat
our
houses and takes hours and so
forth so

41:28.486 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a by-product of the oncoming
energy
production TFM gases like co2
are

41:33.758 --> 41:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committed to the atmosphere but
we have
been working to work with using
these

41:39.030 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emissions capturing them and
three
injecting them into the ground
and

41:42.734 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turning them into rock the
techniques
pioneered here said to be safer
than the

41:47.839 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alternative of storing co2 as a
gas
underground with its expense and

41:53.277 --> 41:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential for leaks under the
right
conditions nature takes hundreds
of

41:58.416 --> 42:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years to transform co2 into
stone

42:01.386 --> 42:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the scientists have done is
to
accelerate the process
exponentially

42:05.990 --> 42:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this represents methods that can
be used
for fighting over warming and
climate

42:10.228 --> 42:14.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change and under that respect
it's a
powerful box so this is calcium

42:14.432 --> 42:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carbonate and this is what the
co2
inject it into the parcel turns
into

42:18.536 --> 42:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the chemical reactions
have
occurred this one is not
representative

42:22.106 --> 42:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what we would see if we were
to the
liqueur or the whole into into
the

42:26.978 --> 42:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bedrock where we are injecting
the co2
rather which is something like
this

42:30.615 --> 42:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we have the the calcium
carbonate
in smaller particles carbon
dioxide is

42:37.388 --> 42:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an invisible gas but it's
ever-present

columbia
university in new york as he
explains

43:29.240 --> 43:34.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the key to ensuring there are no
gasps
leakages is to dissolve the co2
in water

43:34.212 --> 43:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before injecting it into the
bedrock we
simulate the injection by having
here

43:40.818 --> 43:46.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pure water pure water goes in
here and
then we get the co2 that we put
in the

43:46.591 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stream is something similar to
what we
have at the carpets site where
we have

43:52.263 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
co2 charged water that enter the
path of
the Crocs attempt what we don't
so far

43:57.668 --> 44:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a small project but it's
beautiful
because we have shown that you
can

44:02.540 --> 44:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually mineralize co2 within
two years
and reactive rocks like puzzles
and that

44:09.113 --> 44:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is savings to pay for

amounts
of water to dissolve the co2 so
it can

you're

45:00.131 --> 45:01.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing here

45:01.799 --> 45:05.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the car fix project is
one part
of the solution i think the
problem with

45:05.770 --> 45:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climate change what makes it so
difficult is that there's no
silver

45:09.206 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bullet and so the carpet project
isn't a
silver bullet but it's certainly

45:12.944 --> 45:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly another weapon in our
armor so
how much of the world's carbon
could you

45:19.317 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get rid of if you employ this
around the
world

45:22.520 --> 45:27.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have the exact numbers
but we do
have significant potential in
the ocean

45:28.025 --> 45:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ridges in countries like India
that
could really use this technology
only a

45:32.863 --> 45:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few places on land like Northern
California and Southern Oregon
have the

45:37.134 --> 45:41.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
right kind of geological
composition to
make this work but since basalt
is

45:41.505 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plentiful on the ocean floor
varying co2
offshore just might work for

Greenland is
melting rapidly the ice sheet is

46:24.749 --> 46:27.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rapidly producing more icebergs
and

46:27.485 --> 46:31.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we know that it's warmer in
Greenland on
every student been for many
years so

46:31.756 --> 46:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is what we see here that
the
icebergs get more frequently get
larger

46:35.326 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also to some degree because it's

this new technique the more
diffused
emission like from jets cars etc
is

47:02.420 --> 47:08.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be more complicated on
the

47:08.793 --> 47:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theoretically be captured and
stored in
rocks

47:11.495 --> 47:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's no question we need a
legislation to force people to
do this

47:15.599 --> 47:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do you want to do it by
emission
trading scheme do you want to do
it by

47:19.837 --> 47:25.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carbon taxes or if you wanted to
it
strictly directly by legislation
if you

47:25.276 --> 47:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do this then you capture the co2
it has
to be done because it is
expensive and

47:30.848 --> 47:35.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is the oculus heat of all
of the
carbon capture stories it is
expensive

47:35.653 --> 47:41.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but even here in Iceland it's
not being
used to its full extent
75-percent of

47:41.826 --> 47:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

full out
and putting in 100 percent co2
emissions

48:01.746 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from geothermal energy are not
very
large and so we but we saw an

48:05.249 --> 48:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity here to test the
very
interesting technology which we
did and

48:08.819 --> 48:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've improved it works faster
than we
thought it would

48:11.922 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now as for future development we
haven't
decided on that so we might
expand at a

48:16.227 --> 48:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later point but we just haven't
made
that if you try to save the
planet why

48:19.363 --> 48:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did you put in one hundred
percent well
when we were testing the
technology we

48:22.366 --> 48:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't know if it would work and
so we
only started injecting two years
ago

48:25.503 --> 48:29.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're still proving that that
that we
can keep it all down there
everything

48:29.306 --> 48:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turns to minerals as the future
progresses we we might do more
we

48:34.044 --> 48:35.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
haven't decided

48:35.646 --> 48:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the scientists aren't resting on
their

no question it's crucial that
young
people understand the ground
rules for

49:23.627 --> 49:28.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consent but that's where the
conversation is ending and when
it does

49:28.499 --> 49:33.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the media and the internet that
new
digital street corner will
educate our

49:33.537 --> 49:39.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids for us if we truly want
young
people to engage safely
ethically and

49:39.844 --> 49:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes pleasurably it's time to
have frank
honest discussions about what
happens

49:45.850 --> 49:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after yes one thing that's clear
is that
we have to broaden our
definition of sex

49:52.022 --> 49:55.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond intercourse because
despite the
hype

49:55.626 --> 50:00.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these are not having intercourse
at a
younger age but they are
engaging in

50:00.130 --> 50:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other behavior and by ignoring
that by
allowing kids to label other
acts as not

50:06.136 --> 50:07.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sex

50:07.705 --> 50:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they aren't subject to the same
rules
that opens the door to both
risky

50:11.775 --> 50:14.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behavior and disrespect

50:14.111 --> 50:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's particularly true of oral
sex
which teenagers consider less
intimate

women I met had a lot of reasons
for
participating it made them feel
desired

50:28.792 --> 50:30.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it boosted social status

50:30.961 --> 50:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it could also get them out of an
uncomfortable situation i heard
so many

50:36.033 --> 50:40.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stories of one-sided encounters
that i
began asking what if every time
you were

50:41.005 --> 50:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a boy expected you to get
him a
glass of water from the kitchen
but he

50:44.942 --> 50:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never got you a glass of water

50:46.977 --> 50:49.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the girls would laugh and say I
never
thought about it that way

50:50.514 --> 50:55.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex is political as well as
personal
just like the question of who
does the
