WOODRUFF: Now to a major legal
case involving the alleged
smuggling of ancient religious

00:05.133 --> 00:07.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
artifacts.

00:07.233 --> 00:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Late yesterday, the
Department of Justice
said that the nationwide
arts and crafts company

00:10.733 --> 00:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hobby Lobby illegally
imported thousands of ancient
relics from the Middle East.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: The government's
complaint against Hobby Lobby

00:21.566 --> 00:25.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
involves the purchase
and importation of 5,500
rare clay tablets and
artifacts from Israel

00:27.633 --> 00:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the UAE, antiquities that
likely once came from Iraq.

00:31.733 --> 00:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prosecutors allege that
company missed several
red flags indicating
that this purchase was

00:36.333 --> 00:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
highly suspicious.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hobby Lobby argues this
was an innocent mistake
caused by inexperience.

00:41.433 --> 00:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an agreement with the Justice
Department, the company must
now turn over all the artifacts

00:47.200 --> 00:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and pay $3 million.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hobby Lobby is a family-owned
evangelical Christian company.

00:52.366 --> 00:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were at the center of the
2014 Supreme Court case that
ruled companies can't be forced

00:57.100 --> 01:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover birth control for their
employees, and they're also
constructing a multimillion

01:03.700 --> 01:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
dollar bible museum here
in Washington, D.C. that
will open this fall.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on this case, I'm
joined now by Deborah Lehr.

01:10.933 --> 01:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's chairman of George
Washington University's
Capitol Archaeological
Institute and she's

01:15.100 --> 01:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
founder of the Antiquities
Coalition, which works to stop
the looting of world cultures.

01:20.966 --> 01:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour".

01:22.500 --> 01:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you tell me just the basics?

01:24.033 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is -- you heard what I said
about the overview of this case.

01:27.366 --> 01:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the government alleging
that Hobby Lobby did wrong here?

01:30.400 --> 01:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH LEHR, FOUNDER,
ANTIQUITIES COALITION:
The government is alleging
that they imported

01:37.833 --> 01:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowingly items from
Iraq and that they used
falsified shipping labels
and that they didn't

01:46.133 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the appropriate import
permits to be able to
bring these antiquities
into the country.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: And what
are these antiquities?

01:53.733 --> 01:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the items that
we're talking about?

01:55.833 --> 02:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: They are things, as you
said, that are destined for
their biblical museum, and they

02:02.833 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are clay tablets and cylinder
seals and ancient items that
were part of that time period in

02:07.400 --> 02:09.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: So, my understanding
is the company says these were
not destined for the museum,

02:14.833 --> 02:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they said they were just part
of their larger collection.

02:16.866 --> 02:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the government also argues
that there were all sorts of
red flags that should have

02:22.800 --> 02:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tipped off Hobby Lobby
that this was not an
appropriate purchase to make.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us what were
some of those red flags?

02:29.033 --> 02:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEHR: Absolutely.

02:31.633 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Hobby Lobby is a
sophisticated importer
and they know very well
that you have to designate

02:37.633 --> 02:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country of origin and the
appropriate tariff line when
bringing these into the country.

02:42.066 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was not done.

02:44.133 --> 02:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These items, instead of being
declared as antiquities, were
declared as clay tiles or

02:48.700 --> 02:50.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
samples.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were not noted that they
were coming from Iraq but,
instead, that they were coming

02:55.166 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from turkey, and it's no mistake
that we have an agreement with
Iraq that if they were being

03:02.233 --> 03:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought in and declared coming
from Iraq, they would have
to get an appropriate permit.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yet, we don't have a similar
type of agreement with Turkey.

03:09.500 --> 03:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also coming from a part
of the world where conflict
antiquities are being actually

03:16.500 --> 03:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excavated by groups like Daesh
or ISIS, and knowingly being
exported and used as a means

03:22.566 --> 03:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for funding terrorism.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, there are quite a few
red flags that they should have
known, and at a minimum they

03:28.800 --> 03:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should have done provenance
research, which they didn't do.

03:32.900 --> 03:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What they actually paid
five individuals through
seven different accounts
and, as I said, then,

03:41.033 --> 03:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shipped these in different
packets, which might
be understandable, but
to several different

03:45.066 --> 03:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locations in the United States
and without the appropriate
or accurate shipping records.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: Now, the company
agreed they're going to give
back these items and willing

03:55.300 --> 03:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pay this $3 million
to the government.

03:58.633 --> 04:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company argues that they
are new to this business and
that this was really sort of

04:03.100 --> 04:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a rookie mistake, that
inexperience is what
caused these problems,
not any intentional

04:09.200 --> 04:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looking past these
concerns you've raised.

04:12.033 --> 04:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Well, that's a very
interesting argument for a group
that has a business that's based

04:19.066 --> 04:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largely on importing into the
country, and it's those two
claims that they are actually

04:23.766 --> 04:25.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being fined for.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We could understand
potentially that they
may not be sophisticated
about the specifics

04:29.666 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what importing antiquities
from Iraq are involved, but
they are building a museum where

04:36.600 --> 04:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are importing and
collecting historic items
from around the world.

04:39.100 --> 04:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we hope that there are
not other rookie mistakes that
they have made within their

04:44.000 --> 04:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bible museum and the
antiquities that are there.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: I mean, Hobby Lobby
is certainly not the first
organization or institution

04:50.433 --> 04:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to sort of trip this
particular wire.

04:52.866 --> 04:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, major cultural
institutions in the
United States in the
past have had similar

04:57.166 --> 04:58.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this is -- it's
not an uncommon problem.

05:00.566 --> 05:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Well, it's not an uncommon
problem, but we haven't seen
a find quite this large,

05:07.466 --> 05:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that it's very hard to bring
about these kinds of cases,
though we commend the United

05:11.133 --> 05:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States government and
certainly ICE for the
seizures that they're making.

05:15.766 --> 05:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the trade in antiquities
and the list of antiquities
is a global problem, and we're

05:22.766 --> 05:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing it on the increase as
we see conflict in the Middle
East and -- where there are

05:27.400 --> 05:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of sites still
yet to be excavated.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very much just an
endless, almost excavation
that's out there for
thieves to take advantage

05:37.733 --> 05:39.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

05:39.733 --> 05:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: As we mentioned,
they're building this enormous
museum and some of Hobby Lobby's

05:43.266 --> 05:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40,000 other items apparently
are destined to go into this
museum, and other experts

05:50.233 --> 05:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in antiquities have raised
concerns about the speed at
which some of those items were

05:54.533 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gathered.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have you heard
those same concerns?

05:57.833 --> 06:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Yes, we've heard those
same concerns and one hopes
they have actually tone the

06:03.466 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of provenance research
that they should be doing to
ensure these are not part of the

06:08.666 --> 06:10.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
illicit trade.

06:10.733 --> 06:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They actually had consulted one
of the leading cultural heritage
lawyers in the case of this

06:14.600 --> 06:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific import with items
coming of these 5,000 items
who had recommended that they

06:21.400 --> 06:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do a lot more
additional research.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, they actually
had ignored the warning
they received from
their own attorney.

06:27.533 --> 06:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: All right.

06:28.966 --> 06:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deborah Lehr of the Antiquities
Coalition, thanks so much.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEHR: Thank you very much.
