HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.075 --> 00:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
relentless wave
of ISIS-claimed bombings in
Baghdad bring

00:12.713 --> 00:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the death toll to nearly 200
just in the last
week. What's behind the latest
spike in violence?

00:19.086 --> 00:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: With the race's
finish line in
sight, Democrats in Kentucky and
Oregon cast

00:23.824 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their primary vote, but is the
party moving
further apart ahead of the
general election?

00:29.029 --> 00:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, from military artillery
ranges to prisons,
a remarkable story of
transformation and the

00:35.736 --> 00:38.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unlikely allies of endangered
butterflies.

00:38.238 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN CHRISTOPHER, Butterfly
Technician: When
I watched the butterflies
struggling to come

00:41.608 --> 00:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of their cocoon out of their
chrysalis,
it really makes me realize that,
yes, we all

00:48.582 --> 00:51.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do need to struggle to get to
where we need
to be.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.921 --> 00:57.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.224 --> 01:10.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The day's two
Democratic
primaries have Hillary Clinton
hoping to avoid

01:10.437 --> 01:14.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a double defeat, and Bernie
Sanders hoping
to pull out a pair of wins.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Oregon, it's a vote-by-mail
affair. But
Kentucky's primary day was more
traditional,

01:18.979 --> 01:22.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with voters giving voice to the
divisions
in the party.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VIRGINIA HUNT, Kentucky
Resident: I think
Hillary stands up for women and
children and

01:25.085 --> 01:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families, and the violence in
our country,
the gun issue, oh, my goodness,
so many issues,

01:27.220 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy. I think she's
well-qualified.
I think she understands families
in this country

01:28.956 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and what they need.

01:34.661 --> 01:44.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENT LOOFBOURROW, Kentucky
Resident: Partly
because of Hillary's comments on
coal, I think

01:45.005 --> 01:52.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially in Eastern Kentucky,
that's going
to be a big deciding factor. And
even people

01:52.479 --> 01:58.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I wouldn't have expected to
vote for
Bernie are talking about voting
for him.

01:58.585 --> 02:02.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republicans
also voted in
Oregon, with Donald Trump close
to wrapping

02:02.222 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up the GOP nomination.

02:04.091 --> 02:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he reported to the
Federal Election
Commission that he's worth more
than $10 billion,

02:08.161 --> 02:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with annual income of $557
million. He's refused,
so far, to release his tax
returns.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will come back to divisions
on the Democratic
side later in the program.

02:17.738 --> 02:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate voted today to
let families
of 9/11 victims sue the
government of Saudi

02:22.476 --> 02:26.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arabia, setting up a possible
veto showdown.
The Saudis have threatened to
pull billions

02:26.780 --> 02:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars from the U.S. economy
if the measure
becomes law. Senators from both
parties rejected

02:31.952 --> 02:34.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the warning and passed the bill
by voice vote.

02:34.621 --> 02:38.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York Democrat Chuck Schumer
said it sends
a clear message.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), New
York: If the
Saudis didn't participate in
this terrorism,

02:41.962 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have nothing to fear about
going to court.
If they did, they should be held
accountable.

02:47.501 --> 02:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that simple. And there are
certain moral
things that supersede day-to-day
relationships

02:53.774 --> 02:55.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between countries.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House argues the
bill could boomerang, and expose
Americans

02:59.212 --> 03:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
overseas to legal jeopardy.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Spokesman Josh Earnest:

03:03.383 --> 03:08.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
We need to make sure this is --
that we don't

03:08.155 --> 03:13.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
overlook the potential
unintended consequences
of a bill that could put the
United States

03:13.660 --> 03:21.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at risk around the world. That
is a dangerous
proposition and one that the
commander in

03:21.768 --> 03:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief, I think, is rightly
concerned about.

03:23.437 --> 03:27.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
legislation still has
to get through the U.S. House.

03:27.507 --> 03:32.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks as though operator
error was a critical
factor in the Amtrak crash in
Philadelphia

03:32.079 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a year ago. The National
Transportation Safety
Board officially concluded today
that the

03:36.349 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
train's engineer was distracted
by radio traffic.
The train accelerated to 106
miles an hour

03:42.055 --> 03:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going into a sharp curve with a
speed limit
of 50 miles per hour. It
derailed, killing

03:46.893 --> 03:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eight people and injuring
hundreds.

03:49.096 --> 03:55.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department will
investigate state-sponsored
doping by Russian athletes. The
New York Times

03:55.235 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports the focus is on any
Russian officials,
coaches or athletes who violated
drug rules

04:00.540 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at competitions in the U.S.
Those who used
the U.S. banking system in the
process could

04:05.879 --> 04:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be targets, too. It's unclear if
Russian authorities
will cooperate.

04:09.483 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A move to make young American
women subject
to a military draft has been
sidetracked for

04:15.455 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. The House Rules Committee
today dropped
a provision that women 18 to 25
sign up for

04:21.094 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the draft, just as men do.
Conservatives argued
it could present a dangerous
blurring of gender

04:27.234 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lines.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the Armed Services
Committee,
Republican Mac Thornberry of
Texas, raised

04:30.971 --> 04:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions about selective
service overall.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. MAC THORNBERRY (R), Texas:
There has
not been a review of whether we
need selective

04:37.310 --> 04:46.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service since 1994. And so my
strong view
is that we need to ask the big
questions and

04:46.486 --> 04:50.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figure out whether we need it.
If so, for
what purpose? What would happen
if we did

04:50.690 --> 04:53.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away with it? If we do have it,
who's going
to be involved?

04:53.560 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S. has
not had an
actual military draft since
1973.

04:57.864 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate today confirmed Eric
Fanning to
be the secretary of the Army,
the first openly

05:03.170 --> 05:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gay leader of any military
service. He was
approved on a unanimous voice
vote eight months

05:09.242 --> 05:12.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after President Obama nominated
him for the
job.

05:12.145 --> 05:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of Mexico has
proposed legalizing
gay marriage. Enrique Pena Nieto
signed initiatives

05:17.951 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to add the provision to the
Mexican Constitution
and the national civil code. The
country's

05:23.290 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court has ruled it's
unconstitutional
to ban same-sex marriages, but
not all Mexican

05:29.029 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states have legalized the
practice.

05:31.598 --> 05:36.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Racial segregation is getting
worse in America's
public schools. The Government
Accountability

05:36.369 --> 05:41.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Office reports black and
Hispanic children
are increasingly concentrated,
with few, if

05:41.775 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any, white classmates. Those
schools also
offer fewer math, science and
college prep

05:46.813 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classes and have higher rates of
suspension
and expulsion.

05:50.517 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A separate report today focused
on the state
of black America. We will look
at that later

05:55.589 --> 05:57.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street sold off today
on growing
expectations of a new interest
rate hike.

06:00.660 --> 06:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 180
points to close just under
17530. The Nasdaq

06:05.498 --> 06:10.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fell 59 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 19.

06:10.837 --> 06:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a spike in
violence that's claimed nearly
200 Iraqi's

06:15.275 --> 06:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives; the deepening divide in
the Democratic
base; Muslim students speak out
as they struggle

06:20.513 --> 06:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fit in; why higher graduation
rates don't
equal higher incomes for black
Americans;

06:26.820 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

06:37.998 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another day of extreme violence
hit Baghdad
today, as at least 77 people
were killed and

06:42.969 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
140 wounded in a series of
bombings across
the city.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

06:48.775 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The capital
city's largely
Shiite neighborhoods were ground
zero for

06:53.847 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this latest carnage. The worst
killing came
in the Shaab district, where a
roadside bomb

06:58.785 --> 07:00.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
detonated at a crowded
marketplace.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people rushed to help those
victims,
a suicide bomber then attacked.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WATHIQ HASHIM, Iraq (through
translator):
An explosion took place here,
killing a woman,

07:08.595 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her brother and her niece. Some
other people
who came to shop were either
killed or wounded.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What crime have innocent people
committed?

07:15.635 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was much
the same in
the sprawling Sadr City
district. A car bomb

07:21.241 --> 07:26.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
left mangled, burned-out
vehicles at an outdoor
market, while a suicide bomber
targeted a

07:26.212 --> 07:28.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearby eating place.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): This
is the second
blast in Sadr city. One is here
and the other

07:31.818 --> 07:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blast was outside a restaurant.
We are fed
up with this violence. The city
has been the

07:35.955 --> 07:37.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scene of daily explosions.

07:37.824 --> 07:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In all, bombs
ripped through
four different locations across
Baghdad today,

07:42.562 --> 07:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shaab and Habibiya in the north,
as well as
nearby Sadr City, and the Dora
neighborhood

07:47.701 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the southern side. They're
the latest in
a surge of attacks in and near
Baghdad that

07:53.006 --> 07:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have claimed more than 200 lives
in the last
week alone.

07:56.943 --> 08:01.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iraqi officials say ISIS
militants are responsible
and that they're using the
bombings to try

08:01.481 --> 08:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to compensate for ground they
have lost on
the battlefield.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And American officials echo that
belief.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: The
United States strongly condemns
the barbaric

08:10.023 --> 08:15.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorist attacks in Iraq today
that deliberately
and specifically targeted
civilians.

08:15.695 --> 08:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Washington,
State Department
spokesman Mark Toner says it's
clear the battle

08:19.699 --> 08:23.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is far from over against ISIS,
known in Arabic
as Da'esh.

08:23.136 --> 08:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER: These attacks are
the latest reminder
of the danger that this group
continues to

08:28.475 --> 08:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pose to all Iraqis, and the
importance of
Iraqi leaders from all
communities to continue

08:35.715 --> 08:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work together, so that
progress against
Da'esh can continue to be made.

08:40.854 --> 08:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In all, the
Iraqi government
estimates that ISIS still
controls 14 percent

08:45.358 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the nation's territory.
That's down from
40 percent back in 2014, when
the militants

08:50.730 --> 08:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
made a lightning advance.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as Iraqi forces gain ground
in the north
and west, backed by U.S.
airstrikes, the new

08:57.737 --> 09:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violence around Baghdad has put
added strain
on those forces. It could open
the possibility

09:03.777 --> 09:08.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Iraqi army units are pulled
from the
front line fighting ISIS to help
secure the

09:08.748 --> 09:10.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capital.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any such move could undercut
Iraq's ability
to fight ISIS in the north,
especially as

09:14.254 --> 09:19.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iraqi military pursues its
new offensive
to retake Mosul, the nation's
second largest

09:19.459 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

09:24.164 --> 09:34.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We turn to the
race for
the White House.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders and
Hillary Clinton will face off in
primaries

09:38.445 --> 09:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight in Kentucky and Oregon.
But over the
weekend, Clinton and Sanders
supporters were

09:43.283 --> 09:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at odds in Nevada at the state's
Democratic
Convention, potentially
signaling a greater

09:48.087 --> 09:49.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
divide in the party.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to help break down the
divide, Susan
Page, Washington bureau chief at
USA Today,

09:53.626 --> 09:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and from Las Vegas, Jon Ralston,
host of "Ralston
Live."

09:57.630 --> 10:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Page, let's start with --
we're having
this conversation because it was
important,

10:01.601 --> 10:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but even just today, there were
a flurry of
communications throughout the
Democratic Party

10:07.073 --> 10:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the tone and tenor of what
the candidates
should be doing, what their
supporters should

10:11.110 --> 10:13.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be doing. What happened?

10:13.079 --> 10:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, we saw the Democratic
national chairman,

10:14.914 --> 10:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, put
out a statement
saying the campaigns need to
address this,

10:17.650 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is unacceptable, it's
troubling, what
happened in Las Vegas.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you had Bernie Sanders
put out a
statement that was pretty
defiant. He said

10:24.190 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was against violence, of
course, but he
basically continued his kind of
bill of particulars

10:29.195 --> 10:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about grievances about how the
DNC and others
are treating him and his
supporters and not

10:34.367 --> 10:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
treating them fairly, he says.

10:36.202 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we had Harry Reid, the
leader of
the Democrats in the Senate,
decry that Sanders

10:41.140 --> 10:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hadn't done more to address this
in a serious
way. The concern is not just
what happened

10:44.978 --> 10:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend in Las Vegas.
The concern
is, is this a precursor to a
divided Democratic

10:50.149 --> 10:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party as they head into the
national convention
in Philadelphia?

10:52.352 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon Ralston,
fill us in
on what happened over the
weekend in the great

10:55.989 --> 10:57.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state of Nevada.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON, "Ralston Live":
Yes, it wasn't
such a great state over the
weekend, I guess.

11:01.227 --> 11:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a raucous convention. All
conventions
are raucous to some extent, but
the Bernie

11:06.733 --> 11:12.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders folks went into that
convention determined
to cause trouble because they
thought that

11:12.405 --> 11:17.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the state party, which
essentially is Harry
Reid, was being unfair to them.

11:17.110 --> 11:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They filed a lawsuit beforehand.
Reid tried
to tamp it down, got Bernie
Sanders to put

11:22.348 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a unity statement. But that
was just a
fool's errand. It had no chance
of working.

11:27.720 --> 11:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the problem for the
Bernie Sanders
folks, they had no perspective
on this, is

11:33.126 --> 11:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they lost. They lost the
caucus on February
20. They managed to flood some
county conventions,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they didn't get their people
out.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't fill out the close
to 500 delegate
slots for the state convention.
They were

11:46.606 --> 11:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outnumbered, got overruled in
the changes
they were trying to make. And
the real irony

11:51.644 --> 11:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here is, this was only over a
few delegates
that wouldn't have mattered.

11:55.315 --> 12:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Susan said is the most
important
point: How much of a harbinger
is this of

12:00.486 --> 12:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's to come in Philadelphia
in July? I
know a lot of people like to
think of Nevada

12:05.658 --> 12:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as some kind of alien world, but
I think Nevadans
are pretty much like people
everywhere else.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that could be a real problem
for the Democrats
in Philadelphia.

12:12.398 --> 12:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Susan, we were
expecting
perhaps a contested convention
on the Republican

12:17.303 --> 12:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, the unexpected to happen,
and now Donald
Trump seems to be walking slowly
towards what

12:22.275 --> 12:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might be a coronation. Right?

12:24.110 --> 12:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this -- is this -- what we
saw were videos
from cell phones of people,
Bernie Sanders

12:30.149 --> 12:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters yelling, recount,
recount in Nevada.
Is this what we're likely to see
in Cleveland?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It's interesting.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The divisions are much more
serious in the
Republican Party, even though
there is no

12:39.659 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question about Donald -- there
is longer any
question that Donald Trump is
going to be

12:43.262 --> 12:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to nominee. There are real
questions about,
what does the Republican Party
stand for going

12:46.833 --> 12:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward? And he has not been
endorsed by the
top Republican official in the
country yet.

12:51.337 --> 12:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are real divisions in
the Republican
Party, but there are real
divisions in the

12:55.742 --> 13:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic Party as well. Some
of them go
to policy. You know, there's
some policy differences

13:00.513 --> 13:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders,
but a lot of them go to kind of,
who do you

13:05.518 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to get things done? Do you
want the most
experienced candidate? That
would be Hillary

13:09.088 --> 13:10.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do you want somebody who
describes himself
as a revolutionary, who is going
to really

13:13.793 --> 13:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shake things up? And Bernie
Sanders has captured
the energy of this party.
Hillary Clinton

13:18.965 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has won a majority of the votes
in the primaries.
We shouldn't forget that. She's
very, very

13:22.769 --> 13:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely to be nominated as the
nominee at the
convention.

13:26.939 --> 13:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bernie Sanders is the guy
who has the
enthusiasm and the energy, and
especially

13:31.110 --> 13:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with young voters, so he's not a
force to
be denied at this point. And I
think the Clinton

13:35.081 --> 13:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign is still figuring out
how to deal
with that and how to emerge with
a united

13:39.285 --> 13:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party to deal and face Donald
Trump.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon Ralston,
we have had
folks from both the campaigns on
the program,

13:45.258 --> 13:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, you know what, this will
sort itself
out. This is part of the
process.

13:48.194 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of this is structural?
Right now,
Bernie Sanders supporters still
see Hillary

13:52.832 --> 13:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the immediate competitor,
whereas Hillary
kind of sees -- she has sort of
pivoted and

13:58.004 --> 14:01.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sees Donald Trump as the
eventual competitor
and that's where she's focusing
on?

14:01.541 --> 14:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Yes, I think it's a
question
of depth, as opposed to breadth,
in this sense.

14:06.846 --> 14:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think this has anything
to do with
policy, what we saw in Nevada
and what's going

14:11.250 --> 14:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on across the country among the
Bernie Sanders
supporters. Sanders tapped into
something

14:15.955 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, there's no
doubt. You can
call it anti-establishment. You
can say that

14:20.093 --> 14:23.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's millennials getting
involved and wanting
to make change.

14:23.096 --> 14:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we saw in Nevada and
what I think
you're seeing now is frustration
and anger

14:27.400 --> 14:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a process that they see as
slanted against
them and their man. And that is
very, very

14:33.306 --> 14:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult to control once it's
unleashed.

14:35.742 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you see that Bernie
Sanders now
doesn't think -- doesn't think
he should control

14:40.480 --> 14:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it at this point, because, as
you may have
seen earlier, he put out that
defiant statement

14:45.351 --> 14:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about what happened in Nevada.

14:47.253 --> 14:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure he's going to
be able to
control it in July either, even
if he is standing

14:51.958 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up on stage in Philadelphia
holding arm in
arm with Hillary Clinton
declaring unity.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure he can control it.
The question,
though, is how broad is it?

15:01.067 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think some of these feelings
are very deep,
but it is 10 percent of Bernie
Sanders supporters,

15:05.404 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
20, 30? We won't know that until
late July.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how long
does it take
for them to bury the hatchet,
whichever way

15:12.011 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it goes? They have been pretty
tense over
the past few weeks and months.
It's not just

15:16.482 --> 15:20.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one convention, one week. They
can say, we're
all good, let's go ahead and
attack Donald

15:20.887 --> 15:22.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know it's going
to take some
time. As you say, you're not
going to turn

15:24.490 --> 15:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a dime and have the Bernie
Sanders supporters
say, OK, we're OK with Hillary
Clinton.

15:28.427 --> 15:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, in the exit
polls just a week
ago in West Virginia, about four
in 10 of

15:33.032 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders voters in West
Virginia said
they would vote -- if Bernie
Sanders wasn't

15:37.303 --> 15:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nominee, if Hillary Clinton
turned out
to be the nominee, they would
vote for Donald

15:40.740 --> 15:42.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump in November.

15:42.575 --> 15:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's a number that I
think probably
gets reduced if Bernie Sanders
endorses Hillary

15:47.713 --> 15:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, is enthusiastic about
her as I think
a lot of people expect him to
ultimately be.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it takes some time to
persuade people
who are now battling with one
another that

15:56.122 --> 15:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they ought to join forces and be
on the same
side.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon, how much
of it -- in
the people that you have spoken
to, how much

16:01.360 --> 16:05.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of it is about the two
candidates? As you
said, it's not so much about the
policy right

16:05.898 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Yes, I do think it
becomes very
personal.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, campaigns get
very intense.
I think this started almost as a
lark with

16:13.806 --> 16:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some people who were supporting
Bernie Sanders
as a so-called protest against
the anointment

16:19.979 --> 16:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Hillary Clinton. But now it's
become more
real, as he did better than
people thought

16:24.350 --> 16:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was going to do, as he's won
all of these
late states.

16:27.753 --> 16:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I do think there is a
real anger percolating
out there among the Sanders
folks that, wait

16:33.459 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a second, he's being cheated.
Now, that's
not what happened in Nevada, no
matter how

16:37.129 --> 16:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're portraying it. And the
fact that Sanders
was unwilling to say, you know,
I lost fair

16:43.469 --> 16:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and square, and -- than play
into what his
campaign out here is saying
happened, I think

16:47.573 --> 16:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's a very, very bad sign.

16:49.575 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, I do -- I have very
little confidence
that what he has unleashed can
be so easily

16:56.182 --> 17:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controlled, no matter how
skillful Hillary
Clinton or Debbie Wasserman
Schultz or any

17:00.086 --> 17:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the rest of the Democratic
establishment
thinks they are.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jon
Ralston of
"Ralston Live" joining us from
Nevada, and

17:06.792 --> 17:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Page of USA Today, thanks
so much.

17:09.228 --> 17:14.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

17:14.867 --> 17:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: a look
at the growing
problem of harassment
Muslim-American students

17:23.910 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
often face in public schools.

17:26.145 --> 17:30.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Surveys by the Center on
American-Islamic
Relations, a civil rights group,
suggest that

17:30.182 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some 50 percent of Muslim
students have been
bullied by their peers. One hot
spot has been

17:35.087 --> 17:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
St. Cloud, Minnesota, a small
city 90 minutes
west of Minneapolis.

17:38.925 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Tulenko of Education Week
reports on
the controversies there and how
the school

17:42.795 --> 17:44.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
district responded.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our education
series Making the
Grade, which airs Tuesdays on
the "NewsHour."

17:48.234 --> 17:54.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Hafsa Abdi, who's
18-years-old,
remembers well the day four
years ago when

17:54.740 --> 17:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she was first bullied for being
Muslim.

17:56.976 --> 18:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAFSA ABDI, Student: The last
day of by eighth
grade year, I was just going
home, and then

18:01.681 --> 18:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this boy -- I think he was a
year younger
than me -- he pulled off my
hijab. And at

18:05.718 --> 18:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time, I was wearing a longer
one, so it
was more easy to kind of like
pull off from

18:10.089 --> 18:11.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the back.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I also had like a pin
underneath
to hold it in place. And then
that kind of

18:14.393 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came loose. So, like, at the
time I was just
trying to think of like five
different things

18:18.664 --> 18:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at one time, like trying to get
the pin to
not stab me in the neck, and
then turn around

18:22.368 --> 18:24.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to see who this kid is.

18:24.203 --> 18:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In high school,
the bullying
continued, especially when she
and other Muslim

18:28.641 --> 18:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
students would gather to pray.

18:30.443 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAFSA ABDI: Mostly, the
upperclassmen, they
would come into the bathroom
sometimes and

18:35.514 --> 18:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start fighting with the Somali
girls that
were trying to wash for prayer,
and then when

18:40.386 --> 18:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it gets reported, nothing would
happen.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: What would they
say?

18:43.556 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAFSA ABDI: So they'd be like,
oh, well, why
are you making the bathroom
dirty, you stinky

18:47.593 --> 18:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalian or you terrorist or
stuff like that,
or go back to where you came
from.

18:51.731 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Where Hafsa comes
from is Minnesota.
She was born here, after her
parents fled

18:57.703 --> 19:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalia to escape civil war.
Thousands of
other East African refugees have
also come

19:04.343 --> 19:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to St. Cloud, changing the face
of this mostly
white, mostly Catholic small
city.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIE JETT, Superintendent, St.
Cloud Area
School District: My job is to
make sure that

19:11.550 --> 19:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all children, whether it's their
children,
whether it's somebody brand-new
to the country,

19:16.489 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have the best tools
available to
be successful here in America,
here within

19:20.593 --> 19:22.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our community.

19:22.361 --> 19:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: For superintendent
Willie Jett,
educating the new arrivals
required changes

19:26.532 --> 19:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the board.

19:28.334 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIE JETT: What we have had to
do is start
from ground zero. You're trying
to make sure

19:32.538 --> 19:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, A, all the different
languages within
school are welcomed.

19:37.510 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're trying to make sure that
you have interpreters.
You're making sure that you're
revamping teaching

19:42.314 --> 19:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff and support staff and the
way that you
hold conferences, the way that
you send messages

19:47.920 --> 19:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home. It's not what it was 20,
30, 40 years
ago, even 10 years ago.

19:53.025 --> 19:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But all this
change, in and
out of schools, has stirred
resentment.

19:58.431 --> 20:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: There is a lot of racial
prejudice
in our area.

20:02.668 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: At this local
coffee shop, the
divisions in the community were
plain to see.

20:07.840 --> 20:13.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: They think they're
Americans, but when
our forefathers come over, they
blended in

20:13.279 --> 20:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with everyone else. And these
people...

20:17.116 --> 20:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This is America. They
should be talking
English. But you walk downtown,
and they're

20:22.688 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always talking their language.
How in the
hell are we supposed to get to
know them if

20:26.492 --> 20:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we don't know what the hell
they're saying?

20:28.160 --> 20:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I have not had a difficulty
with the
Somali community. We talk about
ourselves

20:33.499 --> 20:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being American. I don't think
we're very welcoming.

20:36.702 --> 20:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Similar tensions
had been building
in the high school, until they
came out online.

20:42.208 --> 20:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAFSA ABDI: They would take
pictures of us.
The one that I can think of most
popular is,

20:48.080 --> 20:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was this girl who was in a
wheelchair
because she broke her leg, and
she was in

20:51.517 --> 20:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lunch line waiting. And this
senior boy
who went here last year, he took
a picture

20:55.588 --> 21:00.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of her and captioned it,
"Handicapped and
ISIS too."

21:00.426 --> 21:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he put it on his
Snapchat story.
So, his Snapchat story is
available for everyone

21:04.196 --> 21:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see. It spread within like 10
minutes,
and the whole school knew about
it.

21:09.335 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Reaction was
swift. Muslim students
walked out of St. Cloud Tech in
spring 2015.

21:19.078 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports of harassment emerged in
other cities
throughout summer and fall of
last year, especially

21:24.517 --> 21:29.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the massacres in San
Bernardino and
Paris, and following candidate
Donald Trump's

21:29.288 --> 21:31.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
call to ban Muslims from
entering the country.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I have had mothers write and say
"My heart

21:34.994 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cries every night thinking how
our daughter
might be treated at school."

21:39.698 --> 21:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: The president
addressed the
problem at his first ever visit
to a mosque

21:43.836 --> 21:45.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in February.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: We are one
American family.
And when any part of our family
starts to

21:48.207 --> 21:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel separate or second-class or
targeted,
it tears at the very fabric of
our nation.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

21:56.415 --> 22:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We're coming together to
create a difference
in your school, so everybody in
the school

22:01.086 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels safe and welcomed.

22:02.855 --> 22:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Back in St. Cloud,
they have
used the year since the walkout
to speak out

22:06.592 --> 22:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against harassment by training
this specially
chosen group of students to go
out and begin

22:12.264 --> 22:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a dialogue with the bullies.

22:14.033 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UBAH NOOR, Student: We're trying
to include
people, and we're not going to
sit here and

22:17.436 --> 22:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, no, your opinion is wrong,
you shouldn't
feel this way and that way about
a culture.

22:20.573 --> 22:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're trying to educate them, so
that -- in
hopes that they would open up
their minds

22:24.510 --> 22:26.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and, I guess, change.

22:26.745 --> 22:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: And how they'd go
about changing
minds could be seen in
activities like this

22:31.784 --> 22:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one, in which the students
arranged themselves
according to how far they were
born from St.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cloud.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Staff member Sebastian
Witherspoon is one
of the group's founders.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you want them to learn?

22:44.096 --> 22:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN WITHERSPOON, St. Cloud
Area School
District: Difference is OK. If
you're from

22:47.866 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalia, if you're from Duluth
as a black
male, if you're from
Robbinsdale, whatever,

22:51.003 --> 22:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is beauty in difference.
There's beauty
in coming from different places,
being different

22:55.941 --> 22:57.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
culture, have different
ethnicities.

22:57.743 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's -- to me, that's --
there's education
to me, is having all these
people who have

23:02.681 --> 23:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a variety of experiences and us
learning from
that to enrich our lives.

23:06.819 --> 23:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Students are also
organizing
a cultural carnival, featuring
food, music,

23:12.124 --> 23:16.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and clothing from their home
countries. But
in some groups, there are
worries about who

23:16.762 --> 23:18.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will come.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: The people who don't
want to be there
are the people that need to be
there. I mean,

23:21.300 --> 23:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel like the people who need
the conversation
aren't the ones that are
actually coming.

23:24.970 --> 23:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: There could be
another approach,
which the president had seemed
to use, and

23:29.041 --> 23:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we brought it up with Hafsa.

23:30.909 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hafsa, I'm wondering maybe the
better approach
would be to educate those
bullies about what

23:37.583 --> 23:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it means to be an American.

23:39.451 --> 23:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAFSA ABDI: Mm-hmm. I do feel
like it comes
from the stereotype of what an
American looks

23:45.457 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like. So, a lot of people feel
someone who
looks like me can't be an
American, because

23:50.429 --> 23:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my skin color or like a hijab
that I'm
wearing, and that makes me not
American.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I feel like really actually
do need to
understand the actual definition
of what it

23:59.405 --> 24:00.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is to be an American.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But others in the
group weren't
so sure.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What about the notion of
America?

24:05.444 --> 24:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UBAH NOOR: I feel like we have
been teaching
what our country has been
founded on since

24:09.915 --> 24:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elementary school with social
studies, with
U.S. history, with government.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been constantly talking
about what
this country is founded on with
liberty, justice,

24:17.790 --> 24:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the pursuit of happiness,
but it's not
sticking to people. So, we need
to find a

24:22.194 --> 24:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different approach to this.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So, one year from
the walkout,
how much has changed?

24:26.865 --> 24:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASEY HILDEN, Student: I have
seen, like,
Muslim people and St. Cloud
natives become

24:33.472 --> 24:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on better terms a little bit,
but it's not
been like super noticeable.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UBAH NOOR: There are other
students that are
stepping out of their way to --
if a Somali

24:41.814 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kid is walking in the hallway
and somebody
says something to them, they
might step in

24:46.018 --> 24:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be like, hey, that's not
funny. And I
have noticed like that happen
every once in

24:50.422 --> 24:53.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
awhile, and I feel like,
gradually, it's changing.

24:53.192 --> 24:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: It's a start on
what's likely
a long-term project.

24:57.529 --> 25:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In St. Cloud, Minnesota, I'm
John Tulenko
of Education Week, reporting for
the "PBS

25:05.738 --> 25:08.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

25:08.841 --> 25:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

25:15.781 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
Episcopal
Church's first African-American
presiding

25:20.486 --> 25:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bishop explains why acting like
Christ would
change the nation's politics;
plus, an unusual

25:26.825 --> 25:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sanctuary for an endangered
butterfly.

25:29.895 --> 25:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the National Urban
League has
released the 40th edition of its
annual State

25:34.867 --> 25:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Black America Report. It's
designed to
provide a snapshot of where
African-Americans

25:39.371 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are relative to whites.

25:41.407 --> 25:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the most recent
report's calculations,
across multiple facets of life,
African-Americans

25:46.078 --> 25:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience equality at a rate of
72 percent,
compared to white Americans, who
score 100

25:51.517 --> 25:53.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to explain is Marc Morial,
president
and CEO of the National Urban
League.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start with that 72
percent number.
How do you get there? What does
that mean?

25:58.791 --> 26:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC MORIAL, President, National
Urban League:
What it means is, if you compare
things like

26:02.761 --> 26:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unemployment, home ownership,
high school
graduation rates, college
attainment rates,

26:09.668 --> 26:17.209 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
median income,
African-Americans, on average,
achieve 72 percent that of where
whites are.

26:17.242 --> 26:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are collective numbers. We
also do the
same comparison for Latinos.
Latinos are at

26:23.315 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 77 percent, whites being,
of course,
100 percent. So, it's designed
to make our

26:29.521 --> 26:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussion about persistent
racial inequality
precise, based on numbers, based
on facts,

26:36.662 --> 26:38.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and based on clarity.

26:38.497 --> 26:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we report this information
every year.
This is the 40th year that we
have done it.

26:42.768 --> 26:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we not only report the
information, Hari,
but we also propose solutions.

26:46.638 --> 26:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
indicators or
one of the factors is income
inequality, the

26:51.710 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gap there. One of the largest
income disparities
that you point out, at least
between black

26:54.980 --> 26:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and white families, is in the
Minneapolis
metro area.

26:57.683 --> 27:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The average household income for
a black family
there is just over a third, 37.8
percent,

27:02.988 --> 27:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the average household income
for a white
family. How does this happen?

27:06.391 --> 27:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC MORIAL: This happens
because the better-paying
jobs, the higher-level jobs go
to whites,

27:13.799 --> 27:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and African-Americans are stuck
in lower-paying
jobs on an overall basis.

27:18.971 --> 27:25.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we see this glaring
disparity in places
like Minneapolis. It's also
present in places

27:25.077 --> 27:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like San Francisco, where there
is a tremendous
amount of success, a highly
educated work

27:29.548 --> 27:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force. African-Americans are
far, far behind.

27:33.285 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that what this means is
that, in a
city like Minneapolis or a city
like San Francisco,

27:38.490 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they won't sweep these numbers
under the rug,
they won't pretend that they
don't exist,

27:42.728 --> 27:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they will recognize and see
it as a challenge
for the civic, business and
political leadership

27:47.966 --> 27:51.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those communities to try to
address these
disparities.

27:51.637 --> 27:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These disparities exist in
virtually every
major American metropolitan
area. It is just

27:57.376 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a question of to what degree.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
interesting things
that you mentioned earlier today
was that

28:01.547 --> 28:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was actually an era in the
United States
where African-Americans were
considered three-fifths

28:06.451 --> 28:08.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a person, right?

28:08.453 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here you have this snapshot
of how African-Americans
are doing over the last 40
years. And looking

28:14.493 --> 28:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back across this, at income
inequality, I'm
struck by the fact that, in
1976, the average

28:20.232 --> 28:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black family nationwide earned
59 percent
of what a white family did. Now,
40 years

28:25.671 --> 28:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, it hasn't gotten much
better, 60 percent.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's behind the stagnation?

28:30.342 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC MORIAL: Notwithstanding the
political
progress, the progress that's
been made in

28:34.613 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms of high school graduation
rates, number
of African-Americans who have
attained college

28:39.451 --> 28:46.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and great individualized
success, this is
a persistent, structural,
locked-in economic

28:46.725 --> 28:48.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

28:48.460 --> 28:53.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe, Hari, that we
highlight it
because it defines the pressing
challenge

28:53.165 --> 28:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the American future. For
Latinos -- and
Latinos and African-Americans
are almost a

28:58.604 --> 29:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third of the population in this
country -- Latinos
don't fare much better than
African-Americans.

29:05.744 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an important challenge
for America's
political business and civic
leaders, to figure

29:11.750 --> 29:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, to concentrate on how to
end these persistent
economic inequities in the
United States.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is a
little bit of
an upside in some of these
numbers.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Higher educational achievement,
that's an
movement. Forty years ago, 6.6
percent of

29:25.797 --> 29:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black people had a bachelor's
degree or more.
That's 43 percent of the number
of whites

29:30.402 --> 29:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with those degrees. But, today,
that percentage
is up to 63 percent.

29:33.972 --> 29:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what led to the increase?
And how is it
affecting the black community?

29:38.143 --> 29:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC MORIAL: So, I think those
increases were
a result of policies that began
in the 1960s

29:43.315 --> 29:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the 1970s, the Pell Grant
program, affirmative
action, and higher education
admissions, the

29:50.322 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desegregation of schools, and
the focus on
educational -- and improving
educational standards.

29:55.761 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of what we have done in the
educational
arena, where there's been a
focus on civil

30:00.065 --> 30:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights and economic injustice,
if you will,
has begun to make a difference.
We see it

30:06.672 --> 30:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indeed in the numbers. But it
has not -- I
repeat -- has not significantly
translated

30:12.611 --> 30:14.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the economic arena.

30:14.546 --> 30:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is why the Main Street
Marshall Plan,
which reflects our plan to
address this, suggests

30:21.019 --> 30:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a commitment of a trillion
dollars over five
years to begin to address some
of these deep

30:26.958 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inequities, is our effort to
say, let's not
get bogged down in just an
analysis and a

30:32.631 --> 30:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
diagnosis of the problem.

30:34.599 --> 30:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's also focus and figure on
how to change
it. Now, this is what we also
saw in the numbers.

30:41.306 --> 30:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From 1963 to 1976, that 13-year
period during
the years in the war on poverty
and at the

30:50.048 --> 30:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
height of the post-civil rights
era, we actually
made tremendous change in
America.

30:55.320 --> 31:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The poverty rate went down.
Income inequality
narrowed. But then, at 1976, it
got stuck.

31:03.161 --> 31:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the disparities of '76 have
become the
disparities of 2016. Now, we
don't know the

31:09.468 --> 31:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effect of the recession, if we
had not had
the 2008-2009 recession, if, in
fact, the

31:17.476 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenges or the disparities
would be less.
We're not sure of that fact.

31:21.947 --> 31:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is, the
disparities
exist. It presents the challenge
for this

31:27.219 --> 31:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nation for our 21st century.

31:29.054 --> 31:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right. You
can go online
to read the Main Street, new
Marshall Plan,

31:33.692 --> 31:35.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so to speak.

31:35.093 --> 31:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you very much more joining
us, Marc
Morial.

31:41.032 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARC MORIAL: Thanks, Hari.
Appreciate it.

31:47.606 --> 31:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Most
Reverend Michael
Curry became presiding bishop of
the Episcopal

31:54.079 --> 31:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Church last November, becoming
the head of
one of the United States' oldest
denominations

31:58.416 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a time of conflict and
change.

32:00.452 --> 32:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The church, like most mainline
Protestant
denominations, has been facing
declines in

32:04.322 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
membership for decades.

32:06.324 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff sat down with
Bishop Curry to
learn how he is leading a church
facing these

32:10.996 --> 32:12.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenges.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bishop Michael
Curry, thank
you for talking to us.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY, Presiding
Bishop, Episcopal Church: Thank
you.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
congratulations on your
position.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY: Thank
you for that.

32:18.703 --> 32:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
first, how would
you describe the place that the
Episcopal

32:23.041 --> 32:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Church occupies in the broad
religious profile
that we have the United States
now?

32:28.747 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY: The
Episcopal Church probably
represents a moderate

32:32.284 --> 32:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voice, a centrist voice in the
religious landscape.

32:37.122 --> 32:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're a tradition that has
historically been
able to live with differences.
And I think

32:43.161 --> 32:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now we're seeing the live that
out in some
new ways that -- to be a church
that really

32:47.299 --> 32:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can embrace diverse, not only
theological
traditions or liturgical and
worship styles

32:53.939 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and approaches, but people of
all stripes
and types.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's -- I think that's the
Episcopal
Church and the Anglican way at
its best.

33:01.680 --> 33:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're now six
months into
this position. How has the fact
that you are

33:07.185 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first black presiding bishop
of the Episcopal
Church of the United States, a
descendant

33:13.391 --> 33:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of slaves, how has that affected
what you
have been able to do so far?

33:18.964 --> 33:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY: Certainly,
that has affected, only in the
sense that

33:24.202 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is a first. Beyond that, I
have a funny
feeling I was probably elected
for a variety

33:29.541 --> 33:31.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of reasons.

33:31.343 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect that my election was a
moment of
hope that we could begin to help
the Episcopal

33:38.817 --> 33:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Church and Episcopalians begin
to focus outward
in some new ways, outward in
ways that actually

33:45.390 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
share the message of Jesus of
Nazareth, which
is fundamentally a message of
love of God

33:51.196 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and love of neighbor.

33:53.064 --> 33:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a game-changer, in
and of itself,
the various forms and ways we're
divided between

33:58.103 --> 34:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other, whether it is racial
or socioeconomic
or political or religious or
tribal or national

34:06.111 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or on and on and on, helping

become instruments of God's work

in this world.

34:14.653 --> 34:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That really does have something
to do with
helping the world stop living a
nightmare

34:21.726 --> 34:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and start living something
closer to God's
dream. And that's worth doing.
And I have

34:28.300 --> 34:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a feeling that's why I got
elected.

JUDY WOODRUFF: You have spoken a
great deal
and preached about social
justice in its many

34:36.074 --> 34:37.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different forms.

34:37.876 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

see as maybe
this developing, evolving vision
and mission

®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY: Scholars,
sometimes, when they look at the
origins of

34:48.620 --> 34:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christianity, they often use the
phrase the
Jesus movement as a way of
describing what

34:53.224 --> 34:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jesus of Nazareth actually was
doing in the
earliest days in Palestine, that
the Jesus

34:59.230 --> 35:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement in the first and second
and third
centuries was a movement of
people who gathered

35:03.868 --> 35:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the teachings of Jesus of
Nazareth.

35:06.738 --> 35:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their gathering around and
committing
themselves to that way of life
that Jesus

35:10.976 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
talked about became
transformative for themselves
and for the world. And, as a
result, the earliest

35:16.815 --> 35:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian communities were
communities where
both slave and free coexisted
and lived together,

35:22.854 --> 35:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where men and women, where Jew
and Greek or
Gentile coexisted and lived
together.

35:31.029 --> 35:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the earliest Christian
movement.
And I'm committed to helping the
Episcopal

35:36.301 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Church become a Jesus movement
today that
helps the society live into a
vision.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's the
practical effect
of that? I mean, how would
people's lives

35:45.543 --> 35:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change as a result of that,
ideally?

®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL
CURRY: I
think dramatically.

35:49.547 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine if just Episcopalians
were practically
living their daily lives as
reflections of

35:55.754 --> 36:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way Jesus of Nazareth lived
his, loving
in the same way that Jesus did
and does, giving

36:01.659 --> 36:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the same way, forgiving,
doing justice,
caring, living compassionate
lives.

36:07.365 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have a funny feeling
Episcopalians could
be transformative both in our
interpersonal

36:12.303 --> 36:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationships and in our social
and political
relationships. What would happen
if Christians

36:17.976 --> 36:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just acted like Christians? It
would change
our politics. It would change
our social order.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could change our global
community.

changing?

of which side of the aisle
you're on -- this

36:30.889 --> 36:36.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't a partisan statement --
imagine our
politics if we began to engage
one another

36:36.795 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not from the perspective of my
unenlightened
self-interest, but from the
perspective of

our interests, the common good,
the common
wheel.

36:46.037 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine our global politics.
Imagine our economic
relationships. It's
world-changing. And I

36:53.078 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen to believe that the way
of Jesus of
Nazareth -- I'm not talking
about everybody

36:56.514 --> 37:00.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
having to become an
Episcopalian, although
that would be nice -- but that's
not what

37:00.118 --> 37:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm really talking about.

37:01.886 --> 37:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm talking about a way of
living that is
deeply grounded in the kind of
love that is

37:07.358 --> 37:13.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not a greeting card for
Valentine's Day, but
that is a way of living in this
world and

37:14.032 --> 37:15.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
engaging it.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, Isaiah got caught up
like in the
spirit, like a Episcopalian in a
Baptist church,

37:18.436 --> 37:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
got caught up in the spirit.

Sunday morning
is the most segregated time and
place in American

life, in church service in this

®MDNM /THE MOST REVEREND MICHAEL

think the church can create
space for authentic

37:37.755 --> 37:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ethnic congregations that
minister to a particular
need, especially at a particular
time.

37:43.328 --> 37:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it must also move into
inhabiting or creating
space for congregations where
people of different

37:49.601 --> 37:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
races and ethnic backgrounds and
socioeconomic
classes actually come together,
because, ultimately,

37:55.907 --> 38:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I do pray for the day
when those of
us who have the same commitment
to follow

38:04.916 --> 38:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way of Jesus of Nazareth can
actually
find that that is our primal
commitment, and

38:10.155 --> 38:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, in Christ, there is no
hindrances.

38:12.924 --> 38:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

west, in him,
no south nor north.

38:16.094 --> 38:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

pray for
that day and have worked for
that day, but

38:20.598 --> 38:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that, between here and
there, we have
to approximate it as best we
can.

JUDY WOODRUFF: We have learned
just recently
that Pope Francis is saying that
he is open

38:32.510 --> 38:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the idea of a commission to
study permitting

inform what the

we finally get to the point of
saying, who

38:48.960 --> 38:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has God called to be a bishop or
a priest
or a deacon, and we're going to
follow that

38:54.632 --> 39:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading, what we have found over
time is,
guess what? A priest is a
priest. A deacon

39:01.906 --> 39:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a deacon. A bishop is a
bishop.

39:03.775 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may be black, white, red,
yellow or brown.
They may be a Republican or a
Democrat. They

39:06.878 --> 39:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may be a man or a woman. They
may be gay or
straight, bisexual, transgender.
They may

39:11.282 --> 39:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a whole host of things, but
they're a priest.
They're a bishop. They're a
deacon.

39:16.588 --> 39:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been our experience for
not everyone,
but for most of us. And the
church has been

39:22.760 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enriched when all voices are
there, when we're
all there together. We got a
better shot of

39:29.133 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making it together than we do
when we're all
apart.

So, I -- you know, my Catholic
brothers and
sisters, you have to make your
decision as

39:37.475 --> 39:44.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

have made ours,
and we have been blessed.

A recent U.N. report warned some
40 percent
of pollinators, birds, bees and
butterflies,

40:37.201 --> 40:41.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Joint Base Lewis-McChord near
Seattle, Washington,

40:55.019 --> 41:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not a place you would expect
to be ideal

species. But it

41:00.591 --> 41:02.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

years ago, this beautiful insect
was on the

41:07.031 --> 41:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brink of extinction; 99 percent
of its native
prairie habitat in the Pacific
Northwest and

41:12.970 --> 41:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

only location

41:18.776 --> 41:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it could be found was here on
the artillery
range.

41:21.312 --> 41:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why? Well, it turns out that
bombs actually
benefit this butterfly.

individual butterfly

41:28.219 --> 41:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has an artillery shell land
on you, it's
bad, but if you zoom out from
that small-scale

41:35.226 --> 41:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact, and look at the way that
the training
ignites fires across the
landscape, and improves

41:42.667 --> 41:47.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the habitat across the
landscape, overall,
it is likely good for the
butterfly population.

41:47.205 --> 41:53.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dan Grosboll is an
insect biologist
at the base who has to be very,
very careful

41:53.478 --> 41:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he's out looking for
butterflies amid
artillery shells.

41:56.614 --> 42:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN GROSBOLL: They have a very
brief adult
life span. And the rest of the
life span,

42:00.284 --> 42:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the whole rest of the year,
they're eggs or

scientists are now working to
boost the numbers

42:07.525 --> 42:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of butterflies here, but there's
only so much
they can do when this land is
needed for other

purposes.

support troops training, so the
troops are

42:21.005 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ready to go and fight. The fact
that we also
can provide habitat for
endangered species

42:27.245 --> 42:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a really good thing, but it's
important
that all of the preservation of

sought out help

happen to have

a lot of time on their hands.

team of inmates
at the Mission Creek Corrections
Center for

women walked into a greenhouse,
known as the
Butterfly Lab, and quickly got
to work. The

43:02.113 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greenhouse, which sits just
outside the walls
of the minimum-security prison,
was built

43:06.717 --> 43:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five years ago with funding from

will get bred to females of this
line, so
we continue to move through that
circle, so

43:51.729 --> 43:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we never breed the same
line to itself.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: And why is that
important?

43:57.268 --> 44:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN CHRISTOPHER: For genetic
reasons. We
want to have as much genetic
diversity, and

44:02.073 --> 44:04.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not have the chance of
interbreeding.

44:04.175 --> 44:09.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The women, who are
called butterfly
technicians, are raising the
insects throughout

44:09.947 --> 44:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their multiple life stages, so
they can be
released back into the wild. It
takes a lot

44:15.019 --> 44:16.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of patience, and a loving touch.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: And that's honey solution
on the Q-tip.

44:19.891 --> 44:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: And they have been
very successful.
More than 30,000 Taylor's
checkerspots have

44:25.429 --> 44:30.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been raised for release by this
facility and
the Oregon Zoo, which has a
similar breeding

44:30.468 --> 44:31.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

44:31.402 --> 44:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I have gone one, two eggs
for sure.

44:36.407 --> 44:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: On the day we visited,
Cynthia Fetterly
(ph) and Jessica Stevens (ph)
were working

44:40.978 --> 44:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together on a very delicate
project, harvesting
the tiny eggs that a female
Taylor's checkerspot

44:47.018 --> 44:48.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had recently laid.

44:48.819 --> 44:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The one I just got done
finished doing
was from the wild, and we
weren't sure if

44:53.090 --> 44:56.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were going to be getting any
eggs off of
them because they already look
like they have

44:56.394 --> 45:00.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been pretty spent. So, getting
that big cluster
of eggs was really exciting.

45:00.498 --> 45:06.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very rewarding, and it's
hard to explain
when you can actually help bring
back an endangered

45:07.004 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
species. It's very humbling to
be able to
do that.

45:10.274 --> 45:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The butterfly breeding
program at
Mission Creek is part of a
larger effort in

45:14.145 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington state called the
Sustainability
in Prisons Project to connect
inmates with

45:19.050 --> 45:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science and nature projects
while they are
serving time. It's a joint
endeavor by the

45:22.987 --> 45:25.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Washington Department of
Corrections and the
Evergreen State College.

45:25.756 --> 45:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLI BUSH, Sustainability in
Prisons Project:
So, we have programs all across
the state.

45:28.893 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelli Bush is the program
manager for the
project, and she says the
benefits go beyond

45:33.464 --> 45:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the prison walls.

45:35.199 --> 45:38.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLI BUSH: It seems to be
changing lives,
not just the incarcerated
individuals, but

45:38.436 --> 45:44.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
corrections staff, and
biologists, that everyone
involved seems to be feeling
good about the

45:44.342 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work and the contributions that
are being
made through these efforts.

45:46.811 --> 45:51.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY LINDERS, Washington
Department of Fish
and Wildlife: Oh, yes, here,
they're on this

45:51.415 --> 45:56.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. When the larvae hatch,
they will actually
just start feeding on those
leaves that it's

45:56.454 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

45:58.289 --> 46:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: One of those who is
benefiting from
the butterfly technicians' hard
work is Mary

46:01.058 --> 46:07.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Linders, a state biologist who
has been spearheading
efforts to increase the
butterfly's habitat,

46:07.098 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and numbers, around Puget Sound.

46:09.634 --> 46:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says, initially, she wasn't
sure how it
would be to work with inmates.

46:13.604 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY LINDERS: It's very
detail-oriented work.
You really need a lot of
consistency in the

46:19.210 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that are actually working
on it, so
it was a risk. But it has proved
to be a tremendous

46:25.483 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success. The folks at the prison
have done
just a fabulous job of running a
top-notch

46:30.855 --> 46:32.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
facility.

46:32.590 --> 46:36.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Linders and a group of
scientists
and volunteers recently gathered
to release

46:36.661 --> 46:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
captive raised caterpillars in a
wildlife
area near Olympia, Washington.

46:43.334 --> 46:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time since the
program began,
they were joined by two inmates
who had raised

46:48.739 --> 46:50.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many of those insects.

46:50.641 --> 47:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY LINDERS: Bugs are -- we
have bugs in
the car. Do you guys want to
help get them

47:01.018 --> 47:01.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out?

47:01.585 --> 47:02.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, absolutely.

47:02.286 --> 47:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY LINDERS: There's your baby.

47:04.088 --> 47:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: After getting a
tutorial from Linders
about where and how to place the
bugs...

47:06.957 --> 47:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY LINDERS: What you're going
to do is release
these in groups of two to five.
So, you can

47:11.996 --> 47:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go ahead and even just brush
them right off
the lid.

47:14.598 --> 47:19.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: ... inmates Michelle
Dittamore and
Eva Ortiz began to release their
fuzzy friends,

47:19.904 --> 47:21.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with mixed emotions.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE DITTAMORE, Butterfly
Technician:
I feel like it's a lot like your
teenager

47:23.407 --> 47:27.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
flying the coop to go to
college, and you're
just like, I have literally
bathed you, I

47:28.012 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have dressed you, I have done
your laundry,
I have packed your lunch.

47:30.948 --> 47:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have to have faith that
there's been
so many generations of just
instinct bred

47:36.087 --> 47:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into these little guys that
they're just -- they're
going to get down there, and
they're just

47:39.423 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to know what to do.

47:41.258 --> 47:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Also helping out at
the release,
Carolina Landa. Landa was
released from the

47:45.162 --> 47:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correctional facility last year
after serving
time for a drug offense.

47:49.366 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she's now enrolled in the
Evergreen State
College environmental science
program, a big

47:53.971 --> 47:57.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
change of direction she
attributes to her
time spent with the butterflies.

47:57.808 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINA LANDA, Evergreen State
College: Here
is an endangered species, and
the fact that

48:02.580 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were saying, yes, we trust
you, yes,
we believe that you can do this
work, and

48:07.785 --> 48:13.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that very much played a big
factor in also
me believing in myself, right,
to start that

48:13.324 --> 48:15.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
path.

48:15.059 --> 48:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The combined efforts
of all the
various individuals and groups
are paying

48:18.162 --> 48:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off. At this release site, the
butterfly population
has doubled since last year to
several thousand.

48:25.302 --> 48:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at Joint Base Lewis-McChord,
the population
has just been deemed to be
self-sustaining,

48:29.406 --> 48:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a significant milestone for the
species.

48:33.010 --> 48:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back at the prison greenhouse,
Susan Christopher
says she's learned some valuable
lessons from

48:37.648 --> 48:39.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the butterflies.

48:39.517 --> 48:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN CHRISTOPHER: When I
watched the butterflies
struggling to come out of their
cocoon out

48:42.186 --> 48:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their chrysalis, it really
makes me realize
that, yes, we all do need to
struggle to get

48:49.260 --> 48:51.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to where we need to be.

48:51.061 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Christopher and her
colleagues are
now gearing up for a busy summer
caring for

48:54.632 --> 48:57.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some very hungry caterpillars.

48:57.067 --> 49:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Washington
state.

49:04.942 --> 49:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And finally
tonight, our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our

49:17.988 --> 49:20.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eye that might be of interest to
you, too.

49:20.658 --> 49:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the waters near Caesarea,
Israel, two casual
scuba divers made the discovery
of a lifetime

49:25.462 --> 49:31.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last month when they spotted a
bronze statue.
The duo had stumbled upon the
remains of a

49:31.936 --> 49:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,600-year-old Roman shipwreck
and the largest
cache of underwater artifacts
found in Israel

49:36.807 --> 49:38.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 30 years.

49:38.742 --> 49:42.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They alerted local
archaeologists, who later
recovered bronze busts, oil
lamps and thousands

49:42.146 --> 49:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of coins bearing the faces of
Roman emperors
from the wreckage.

49:49.720 --> 49:55.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we mark the passing of the
world's longest
serving symphony musician.
Bassist Jane Little

49:55.392 --> 50:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first debuted with the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra
in 1945, when she was just 16.
Little was

50:01.832 --> 50:08.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still performing with the
organization 71
years later, when she collapsed
on stage Sunday

50:08.672 --> 50:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the evening's encore of
"There's No
Business Like Show Business."
She later died

50:13.677 --> 50:18.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a local hospital. Jane Little
was 87 years
old.

50:18.415 --> 50:23.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, tonight on "Frontline," a
revealing
documentary about the rise of
Islamic State

50:23.354 --> 50:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militants. "The Secret History
of ISIS" takes
a critical look at decisions
taken by the

50:28.525 --> 50:34.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. and its allies and how they
may have
fomented sectarian tensions
among Iraqis,

50:34.365 --> 50:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowing extremist leader Abu
Bakr al-Baghdadi
to recruit thousands and take up
arms.

50:39.670 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Back in Raqqa,
Baghdadi was pursuing
a new opportunity, the expansion
of ISIS into

50:48.312 --> 50:50.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

50:50.114 --> 50:52.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD CLARKE, Former U.S.
Counterterrorism
Official: At this very time that
al-Baghdadi

50:52.449 --> 50:58.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is building his organization in
Syria, the
Baghdad government, the Shia
government and

50:59.023 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-Maliki, starts virtually
assaulting the
Sunni homeland.

51:05.129 --> 51:10.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In the years since the
American
troops had left, Iraq's prime
minister, Nouri

51:10.367 --> 51:14.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-Maliki, a Shia, had initiated
a crackdown
on the Sunni population.

51:14.872 --> 51:19.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS, Brookings
Institution: The
Sunni-Arab tribes in Iraq had
become disillusioned

51:19.143 --> 51:24.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the Shia-dominated
government in Baghdad,
so there was widespread
disaffection among

51:24.348 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tribes. They began to engage
in a series
of protests against the regime.

51:29.486 --> 51:34.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMA SKY, Author, "The
Unraveling": These
protests were violently crushed,
and in such

51:34.658 --> 51:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an environment, that enabled
Islamic State
of Iraq to rise up out of the
ashes and say,

51:41.231 --> 51:45.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will protect Sunnis from
Maliki.

51:45.502 --> 51:52.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: It was the moment
al-Baghdadi had
been waiting for.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD CLARKE: Where had the
Sunnis to go?
There's only one place they can
go? And it

51:56.914 --> 52:02.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is that residual of the
insurgency that is
now run by al-Baghdadi.

52:02.286 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: In early 2014,
Baghdadi's forces
began the campaign the take
Iraq.

52:08.425 --> 52:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEXTER FILKINS, Author, "The
Forever War":
The Iraqi army, which was built
at the incredible

52:12.162 --> 52:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expense -- I don't even know
what the final
price tag was, $30 billion --
largely by the

52:18.802 --> 52:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, paid for by the
American taxpayer,
you know, all their equipment,
everything,

52:22.606 --> 52:24.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it all came apart.

52:24.441 --> 52:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In no time at all,
they rolled over
Fallujah, Ramadi, then the
biggest prize yet,

52:32.716 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
