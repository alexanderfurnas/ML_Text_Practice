JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
an experiment in rethinking
public housing that encourages

00:05.033 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
healthier living by
changing the larger
environment for residents.

00:09.766 --> 00:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown
reports from Denver.

00:12.033 --> 00:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At age 71, Noel
Taylor says she's become more
active and health-conscious

00:18.866 --> 00:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than ever before.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOEL TAYLOR, Denver: Every
year, I improve my diet,
I improve my exercise.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Her
change in behavior didn't
happen by accident.

00:28.866 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Four years ago, here in
downtown Denver, Taylor
joined an experiment in
making healthy living

00:35.133 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
part of the design
and daily life of a
public housing project.

00:38.966 --> 00:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Among the amenities here,
access to a garden plot.

00:42.366 --> 00:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NOEL TAYLOR: I noticed,
all summer long, I
was getting healthier.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The more of my own
vegetables I was eating,
the more energy I had.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's made a huge difference.

00:52.866 --> 00:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this sounds
all too good to be true.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NOEL TAYLOR: I know.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:57.033 --> 00:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And there's more.

00:59.066 --> 01:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Denver Botanic Gardens
hosts a farmers market giving
away free produce to residents.

01:04.866 --> 01:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We're going to talk about
how to shop healthy on a budget.

01:06.866 --> 01:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another group
offers classes on healthy
recipes and shopping.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Now we will take
your blood pressure.

01:12.233 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a
clinic on the ground
floor of one building,
public health physicians

01:16.033 --> 01:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schedule regular visits
to do routine checkups.

01:19.533 --> 01:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a light rail stop, both
for easy transportation and to
get residents out of their cars.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Do the other side now.

01:28.333 --> 01:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Plus,
bike rentals and a nearby
shop to teach kids how
to maintain their bikes.

01:34.466 --> 01:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the architecture and public
art was designed to encourage
residents to get outside and

01:39.433 --> 01:41.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take a walk.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO, Director,
Denver Housing Authority: We
really wanted this to look like

01:42.700 --> 01:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a neighborhood,
not a development.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ismael Guerrero,
director of the Denver Housing
Authority, says that, 10

01:48.900 --> 01:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, this was a high-crime
neighborhood, with 250 units
of rundown public housing.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Something had to be done.

01:57.866 --> 02:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: What we
learned in early conversations
with residents in particular

02:00.500 --> 02:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, they didn't just want
a new unit to move into.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted a better
quality of life.

02:06.333 --> 02:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we really started expanding
our perspective on what we
were trying to accomplish here.

02:10.700 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The result
completed earlier this summer
is the Mariposa development, a

02:17.700 --> 02:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mixture of 800 apartments and
town homes, one-third public
housing, a third subsidized,

02:21.966 --> 02:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a third rented
at market value.

02:24.766 --> 02:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overall cost was
$150 million; $60 million
came from federal, state
and local government

02:31.366 --> 02:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs, with the rest coming
through private investment.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Already, Mariposa is
becoming a model for
rethinking public housing.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: Part of it is
physical health, and part of
it is what we call neighborhood

02:44.033 --> 02:45.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
health.

02:45.033 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How healthy is the place?

02:47.033 --> 02:48.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it safe?

02:48.466 --> 02:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are there healthy
activities for you to do?

02:50.333 --> 02:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there healthy food
in the neighborhood
for you to go and eat?

02:53.766 --> 02:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a healthy economy
where people can get jobs
and start a business?

02:56.933 --> 03:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Osage
Cafe, located in one of the
apartment buildings, is designed

03:01.766 --> 03:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to meet some of those needs.

03:04.033 --> 03:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to the food, it
provides culinary training and
internships for young people

03:08.733 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the neighborhood, like
20-year-old Israel Trejo.

03:12.066 --> 03:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISRAEL TREJO, Denver: And I
think that's where I discovered
I had a passion for cooking.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What
did it give you?

03:16.666 --> 03:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISRAEL TREJO: It gave me
the entire world, basically.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Like, with the skills
that I have learned now,
I could go anywhere.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I could go be anything.

03:25.300 --> 03:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trejo now has
a job at one of Denver's top
restaurants, and plans to

03:29.000 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operate his own food truck soon.

03:30.933 --> 03:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA RODRIGUEZ, Denver:
Are you looking forward to
helping me grow some fruits and

03:35.100 --> 03:37.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vegetables?

03:37.066 --> 03:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Angela Rodriguez,
a single mother of two teens,
dreams of one day buying

03:40.700 --> 03:42.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her own home.

03:42.733 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a full-time job at a
nearby community college, but
Denver's booming housing market

03:48.166 --> 03:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makes ownership difficult.

03:50.266 --> 03:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lives in a subsidized town
home at Mariposa, which she
says is very different from the

03:55.100 --> 03:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
old-style projects
she grew up in nearby.

03:57.433 --> 04:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA RODRIGUEZ: As a new
style of public housing, it did
take me a little bit of time

04:01.966 --> 04:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the adjustment.

04:04.366 --> 04:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When new tenants are
mingling with other tenants
that come from different
walks of life, it's

04:09.733 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helping us to develop into new
perspectives of modern living.

04:13.066 --> 04:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rodriguez
uses public transportation,
has taken up gardening,
and has fully embraced

04:19.266 --> 04:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the culture of health
that is promoted here.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But is Mariposa working?

04:24.533 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's too early for
definitive answers.

04:27.100 --> 04:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to a 2015 study by the
Denver Public Health Department,
about half the residents

04:33.933 --> 04:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had participated in
health-related activities
over the previous three years.

04:39.700 --> 04:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the study also showed the
amount of exercise residents
pursued had changed little.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just over a third said they
exercised five times a week.

04:47.433 --> 04:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About the same amount said they
exercised one to four times
a week, and 26 percent said

04:53.300 --> 04:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they rarely or never exercised.

04:55.333 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Smoking rates decreased, but
only slightly, from 30 percent
of residents down to 24 percent.

05:02.266 --> 05:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these so-called active
staircases, designed
with a bit of whimsy...

05:05.900 --> 05:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: It's a way
to engage kids, and actually
now the adults enjoy it.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... to
lure residents away
from using the elevator.

05:12.366 --> 05:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, so far, they're
not having a big impact.

05:15.033 --> 05:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MICKIEWICZ, Denver
Public Health: We actually did
observational counts, where

05:18.566 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we sat there and we counted
people who used the stairs vs.
people who used the elevator,

05:23.533 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we compared it
against a control
staircase in the Mariposa
redevelopment, and we found

05:30.966 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
absolutely no difference.

05:33.266 --> 05:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Theresa
Mickiewicz, an epidemiologist
with Denver Public
Health, is overseeing a

05:37.033 --> 05:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
study of the development.

05:39.066 --> 05:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while major improvements in
health remain to be seen, she
believes something important

05:43.766 --> 05:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is happening here, and
she expects the numbers
to reflect that soon.

05:47.533 --> 05:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MICKIEWICZ: While
maintaining my objectivity
as an evaluator, do
I think that there is

05:53.400 --> 05:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
value in this type of project?

05:55.900 --> 05:57.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say yes.

05:57.900 --> 06:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Individually, these components
have been shown in the evidence,
in literature, to improve

06:03.100 --> 06:05.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health outcomes.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The city
of Denver is so confident
in this new model,
it's about to embark on

06:08.900 --> 06:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a similar development
that will be three times
larger than Mariposa.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That construction is expected
to begin later next year.

06:17.566 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown,
reporting from Denver.
