JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a different
look at the
war in Afghanistan, through the
lens of inspiring

00:10.410 --> 00:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young women, making history by
way of education.

00:14.047 --> 00:18.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, we brought you the
story of the
Zabuli girls school about 100
miles north

00:18.652 --> 00:23.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Kabul. Just before Christmas,
the first
class graduated.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beth Murphy of The GroundTruth
Project has
their story.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY, The GroundTruth
Project: Winter
in Afghanistan signals that the
school year

00:30.764 --> 00:37.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ending. In this village, this
unprecedented
graduation comes at a difficult
time in the

00:37.037 --> 00:38.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN, Founder, Zabuli
Education Center:
Today is a very special day for
us. It is

00:42.709 --> 00:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond my thoughts, beyond my
dreams that
we will be sitting here with our
first graduating

00:49.549 --> 00:50.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

00:52.419 --> 00:57.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: This is the first
time girls
in this village have ever
graduated from high

00:57.324 --> 01:04.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
school. When the Zabuli
Education Center opened
in 2008, the villagers wanted it
to be a boys

01:04.431 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school. But attitudes here have
changed.

01:09.836 --> 01:19.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: This is our first
young woman who
get married and she is still in
school. And

01:19.880 --> 01:26.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: This is our first
young woman who
get married and she is still in
school. And

01:26.653 --> 01:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she wants to continue her
education.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34.795 --> 01:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): And
thanks to the
people of this village, who
really supported

01:44.137 --> 01:48.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and helped the school. Without
your help,
this wouldn't be possible.

01:48.208 --> 01:54.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN (through translator):
And, also,
you really helped us. Without
your help, this

01:55.015 --> 01:56.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't be possible.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MUHAMMAD MALANGATAYE,
Afghanistan (through
translator): It is my duty, and
I feel a strong

02:00.053 --> 02:05.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility. These are our
students, and
they are like my daughters.
Coming to this

02:05.125 --> 02:10.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ceremony will help convince them
to continue
their education, and also help
to convince

02:10.163 --> 02:11.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their parents.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BETH MURPHY: This first
graduation followed
many of the traditions you would
expect, parents

02:15.869 --> 02:18.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overcome with pride and lots of
time spent
reminiscing.

02:18.505 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: You have opened a
door that, at
one time, I couldn't even
imagine. This is

02:25.178 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: You have opened a
door that, at
one time, I couldn't even
imagine. This is

02:45.198 --> 02:47.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
truly a dream come true.

02:48.001 --> 02:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Highlights from
their high school
years include field trips to
Kabul, videoconference

02:53.607 --> 02:59.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
calls with girls in
Massachusetts, where Razia
called home in the U.S., and the
groundbreaking

02:59.413 --> 03:06.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Razia Jan Institute, that
will allow
them to go to college right in
their own village.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Despite the successes,
challenges remain.

03:08.989 --> 03:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: When we started,
there was great
hope that things will get
better. But within

03:15.395 --> 03:22.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these eight years, things have
gone worse.
Many schools have been burned.
Many girls

03:22.302 --> 03:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been poisoned. Believe me,
we are very
cautious. We can't put our
guards down.

03:27.874 --> 03:33.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: 2015 has not been a
good year
for Afghanistan. According to a
new Pentagon

03:33.480 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report, things have gotten worse
since Afghan
forces took over the U.S. and
NATO-led mission

03:38.151 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one year ago. Taliban attacks in
Kabul alone
jumped nearly 30 percent.

03:44.624 --> 03:48.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROUALLAH SAHIB, Mayor of Deh
Sabz District
(through translator): The
security of this

03:48.628 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
village is better than a lot of
places, because,
here, we support the government
and police.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are supporting them. The
international
community and Obama decided to
get out of

03:57.637 --> 04:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. They decided to
leave. At the
time, ISIS wasn't in Afghanistan
and the Taliban

04:03.110 --> 04:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was weak. But now ISIS is here,
and the Taliban
is getting stronger.

04:07.481 --> 04:14.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Stronger and more
deadly, 54
people dead after a 24-hour
Taliban assault

04:14.554 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Kandahar Airport, an
attack that was
staged from a nearby school, and
then another

04:21.695 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): There
was an explosion
here. It was really powerful.
And right after

04:26.466 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the blast, this area was
shaking.

04:28.335 --> 04:34.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Amidst all the
danger, graduation,
a pocket of relative peace and a
success to

04:34.174 --> 04:40.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
celebrate, it's the kind of
investment the
U.S. wants to protect and a
reason for troops

04:40.380 --> 04:44.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to remain on the ground.

04:44.251 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration made an
about-face on pulling
U.S. troops, a recognition that
there's no

04:49.823 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end in sight to increased
threats from insurgent
and terrorist groups.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama announced the
change in October.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I have decided to maintain our
current posture

05:00.667 --> 05:08.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan
through most
of next year, 2016. This modest,
but meaningful

05:08.141 --> 05:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extension of our presence, while
sticking
to our current narrow missions,
can make a

05:15.549 --> 05:17.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real difference.

05:17.384 --> 05:22.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROUALLAH SAHIB (through
translator): Without
their help, we will have more
terrorists here.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regional security and world
security will
be at risk. We need them to be
here.

05:26.493 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: America has and other
international
countries have invested so much
here. It is

05:36.503 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really something that they
cannot lose completely,
because there are such great
other supreme

05:46.213 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
powers that will come in a very
passive way,
like Russia and China.

05:52.786 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think America will never
leave. America
is going to be always. I think
there is a

05:59.226 --> 06:04.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great interest of America in
this country
for their own security.

06:04.764 --> 06:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
