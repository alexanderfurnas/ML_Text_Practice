OF KAISER HEALTH NEWS.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS

04:51.524 --> 04:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO

04:53.860 --> 04:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCRIBE IT AS OBAMACARE

04:54.994 --> 04:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLODING.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE'RE CLEARLY SEEING THAT

04:58.064 --> 04:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A DISPARITY IN HOW MUCH

04:59.999 --> 05:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOICE CONSUMERS HAVE WHEN THEY

05:02.168 --> 05:04.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO TO THESE EXCHANGES.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> INSURERS HAVE BEEN VERY

05:05.138 --> 05:06.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY

05:06.606 --> 05:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE'S BEEN A

05:09.208 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF DISCUSSION ON CAPITOL

05:10.443 --> 05:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILL ABOUT REPEALING AND

05:11.577 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACING THE LAW.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FELL APART THIS WEEK IN THE

05:14.013 --> 05:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BEEN CONCERN ABOUT

05:16.049 --> 05:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP

05:17.383 --> 05:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION WOULD FUND THESE

05:18.618 --> 05:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COST-SHARING SUBSIDIES THAT HELP

05:20.553 --> 05:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WITH THEIR

05:21.621 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERN

05:24.257 --> 05:25.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM INSURERS ABOUT TOUGH

05:25.558 --> 05:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL

05:26.759 --> 05:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATE, THIS REQUIREMENT THAT

05:28.461 --> 05:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE

05:29.762 --> 05:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR PAY A FINE.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT

05:32.865 --> 05:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECTIVELY, INSURERS ARE

05:34.400 --> 05:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING WORRIED, AND SOME ARE

05:35.902 --> 05:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDING NOT TO GO INTO SOME

05:37.170 --> 05:39.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKETS OR LEAVE OTHER MARKETS

05:39.072 --> 05:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR RAISE THEIR PRICES TO TRY TO

05:40.573 --> 05:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPENSATE FOR THAT UNCERTAINTY.

05:42.408 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: I REMEMBER

05:42.709 --> 05:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE A.C.A. FIRST PASSED,

05:44.110 --> 05:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE BIG, SORT OF

05:46.512 --> 05:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPROMISES TO THE INSURANCE

05:48.348 --> 05:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDUSTRY WAS SAYING, "HEY, THIS

05:49.982 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WILL BE IN

05:51.017 --> 05:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE.

05:51.784 --> 05:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO HAVE

05:52.785 --> 05:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURANCE.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

05:54.587 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND NEW

05:55.755 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUSTOMERS."

05:56.489 --> 05:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE THOUGHT HAS BEEN ALSO

05:59.092 --> 06:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY

06:00.493 --> 06:01.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE INSURERS, AND THEY HAVE

06:01.594 --> 06:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOTTEN IN, BUT THEY KNEW

06:02.562 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIALLY, THE SICKEST PEOPLE

06:04.097 --> 06:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD COME IN FIRST.

06:05.465 --> 06:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY

06:06.599 --> 06:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPENSIVE.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN

06:09.035 --> 06:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT THE PRICE

06:10.837 --> 06:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PREMIUMS.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE HAVE OPTED, RATHER,

06:14.107 --> 06:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TO ENROLL AND SIMPLY PAY

06:15.908 --> 06:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, OF

06:20.213 --> 06:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, WE KNOW HAS BEEN A

06:21.381 --> 06:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIGHTNING ROD ON CAPITOL HILL.

06:22.348 --> 06:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS HATE IT.

06:23.349 --> 06:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAY AMERICANS SHOULDN'T BE

06:24.517 --> 06:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRED TO PURCHASE INSURANCE

06:25.918 --> 06:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR BE TOLD WHAT INSURANCE TO

06:26.719 --> 06:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUY.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT HAS BEEN A FOCAL POINT OF

06:28.988 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS EVER SINCE THE AFFORDABLE

06:30.223 --> 06:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE ACT WAS CREATED.

06:31.524 --> 06:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: INSURANCE

06:32.592 --> 06:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE

06:33.726 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.

06:34.894 --> 06:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THINKING A COUPLE OF

06:35.795 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OUT.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

06:38.097 --> 06:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE SEEN THEM START TO MAKE

06:39.732 --> 06:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVES REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS

06:41.000 --> 06:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO WIN THIS WHITE HOUSE.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, THEY LOOKED AT THE

06:43.469 --> 06:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKET, AS YOU MENTIONED, SOME

06:44.437 --> 06:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE IN, AND SOME ARE OUT.

06:45.805 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AGAIN, WE GET BACK TO THE

06:46.706 --> 06:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCERTAINTY.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS A MARKETPLACE WHERE THEY

06:49.275 --> 06:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO BE?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL THIS MARKETPLACE BE

06:51.577 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTED BY THE TRUMP

06:52.812 --> 06:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION?

06:53.713 --> 06:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS

06:54.881 --> 06:56.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BE

06:56.582 --> 06:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLEMENTED AND OVERSEEN BY THE

06:58.684 --> 06:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT

06:59.952 --> 07:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS JUST BEEN AT THE FOCAL POINT

07:01.721 --> 07:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS ENTIRE THING, WHERE THE

07:02.855 --> 07:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURERS ARE INVOLVED.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, WHAT ABOUT

07:05.258 --> 07:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID EXPANSION OR AT LEAST

07:06.325 --> 07:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SUBSIDIES, AND HOW MUCH THE

07:08.394 --> 07:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ANY SORT

07:09.896 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A REPLACEMENT WILL PAY?

07:11.531 --> 07:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT CAN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

07:12.532 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, SINCE THINGS

07:15.168 --> 07:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE FALLEN APART ABOUT THIS ON

07:16.569 --> 07:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPITOL HILL, THE MEDICAID

07:18.204 --> 07:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPANSION, WHICH 31 STATES

07:20.072 --> 07:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBRACED, IS STILL THERE.

07:22.842 --> 07:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY COULD STILL COUNT ON

07:23.976 --> 07:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ENROLLMENT.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR NOW, THE SUBSIDIES

07:26.712 --> 07:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER,

07:28.047 --> 07:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUND ABOUT EIGHT OUT OF TEN

07:29.215 --> 07:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFICIARIES, ARE STILL THERE.

THIS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL

18:43.222 --> 18:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY HAVE?

18:44.323 --> 18:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE CONSTITUTION HAS

18:46.325 --> 18:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE ARTICLE THAT GIVES VERY

18:47.860 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS

18:49.495 --> 18:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BODY DOES.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT SAYS ALMOST NOTHING,

18:52.231 --> 18:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT CAN

18:53.332 --> 18:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION, AND IT

18:54.833 --> 18:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT BE CHALLENGED OR

18:56.235 --> 18:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERRULED BY ANY OTHER

18:57.469 --> 18:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH MEANS THAT NEITHER THE

19:00.139 --> 19:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURTS, NOR ANY EXECUTIVE BRANCH

19:03.342 --> 19:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERS, OR ANYONE ELSE, CAN TELL

19:05.677 --> 19:06.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ASSEMBLY NOT TO DO

19:06.545 --> 19:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING.

19:06.912 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST TIME THIS WAS DONE IN

19:07.880 --> 19:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1999, THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR

19:09.882 --> 19:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATE TO REWRITE THE

19:10.949 --> 19:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION.

19:12.217 --> 19:13.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE CONSTITUTION ALREADY

19:13.719 --> 19:15.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVES QUITE A BIT OF GENEROUS

19:15.053 --> 19:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE POWER TO THE

19:16.421 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT, BUT THEY COULD, FOR

19:17.823 --> 19:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, DISSOLVE THE

19:19.391 --> 19:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION-RUN CONGRESS.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY COULD FIRE THE PROSECUTOR,

19:23.729 --> 19:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR, WHO HAS

19:25.030 --> 19:26.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF

19:26.031 --> 19:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MADURO GOVERNMENT.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT EFFECTIVELY CREATES A

19:29.935 --> 19:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPERBODY, THAT WILL HAVE

19:32.838 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNLIMITED POWERS, WITH VERY

19:34.840 --> 19:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCLEAR CONSEQUENCES AS TO WHAT

19:36.275 --> 19:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD MEAN.

19:37.042 --> 19:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS COULD

19:37.409 --> 19:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY KEEP MADURO IN POWER

19:38.677 --> 19:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEFINITELY, KIND OF SLIDING

19:41.113 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM DEMOCRACY INTO A

19:43.315 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DICTATORSHIP.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD

19:45.584 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY DO.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE CURRENT ELECTORAL

19:48.120 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHEDULE HAS MADURO'S TERM

19:50.689 --> 19:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENDING IN EARLY 2019, AND THE

19:52.791 --> 19:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE IN

19:54.326 --> 19:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATE 2018.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

19:56.595 --> 19:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD DO IS, NOT ONLY ALTER THE

19:57.796 --> 19:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME FRAME FOR WHEN THE

19:59.164 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS WOULD HAPPEN, BUT THEY

20:00.666 --> 20:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD ALSO ALTER THE WAY THE

20:01.967 --> 20:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUAL VOTES ARE TAKING PLACE.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH, IF YOU NOTE, IN THIS

20:05.137 --> 20:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, THIS IS BEING--

20:07.005 --> 20:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE SEATS ARE BEING

20:08.140 --> 20:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRIBUTED BY MUNICIPALITY,

20:09.775 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH BASICALLY OVER-REPRESENTS

20:11.310 --> 20:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RURAL AREAS, AND IN EFFECT,
