President Trump
welcomes Egyptian president to
the White House,

00:10.410 --> 00:14.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the administration signals
new U.S. priorities.

00:14.481 --> 00:19.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Monday: As the
Trump family's
role expands in the White House,
we look at

00:19.253 --> 00:22.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump's
places in
the new administration.

GLENN THRUSH, The New York

White House, the Obama White
House were stocked

00:26.360 --> 00:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with experienced people who had
careers as
public servants.

00:30.998 --> 00:34.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Trumps came in with the
promise to
change that paradigm.

00:34.334 --> 00:40.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And combating India's
trash problem
-- how one company is trying to
reduce the

00:40.240 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
huge landfills that are wreaking
havoc on
India's most populous cities.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's

Judy Woodruff is on assignment
tonight.

01:04.097 --> 01:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stage is now set for what's
likely to
be a bitter showdown on the
Senate floor over

01:09.136 --> 01:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Supreme Court nominee Neil
Gorsuch.

01:11.038 --> 01:16.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He cleared the Judiciary
Committee today,
but it came as Democrats secured
41 votes

01:16.743 --> 01:18.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against him.

01:18.245 --> 01:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means Republicans won't get
the votes
they need to break a filibuster.

01:22.516 --> 01:27.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Lindsey Graham warned
that his
side will change Senate rules to
allow confirmation

01:27.721 --> 01:28.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a simple majority.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:30.624 --> 01:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Senate
traditions are going to change
over this man,

01:34.962 --> 01:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based on the times in which we
live.

01:36.863 --> 01:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I find it ironic and sad
that we're going
to change rules over somebody
who's lived

01:44.972 --> 01:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such a good life, who's been
such a good judge
for such a long time.

01:50.911 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Democrats, like
Patrick Leahy,
said Gorsuch is too
pro-corporation and too

01:56.450 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conservative.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.119 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont: I
cannot vote
solely to protect an institution
when the

02:02.356 --> 02:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights of hardworking Americans
are at risk,
because I fear that the Senate I
would be

02:09.262 --> 02:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defending no longer exists.

02:11.999 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I must first and foremost vote
my conscience
both today and later this week.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Republican leaders
say a confirmation
vote will come by Friday.

02:25.145 --> 02:30.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump welcomed his
Egyptian counterpart,
Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to the
White House today.

02:30.250 --> 02:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration had
kept El-Sisi
at arm's length over human
rights abuses.

02:35.022 --> 02:39.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump hailed the
Egyptian leader,
and the two men talked about
fighting terrorism

02:39.993 --> 02:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and helping Egypt's faltering
economy.

02:41.962 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have a full report on
the changing
relationship after the news
summary.

02:46.700 --> 02:51.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

of others.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A second bomb was defused
nearby.

02:55.575 --> 03:00.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators are treating it as
a terrorist
attack, possibly linked to
Islamist militants.

03:00.580 --> 03:06.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amateur video captured the scene
moments after
the blast, with people rushing
to safety.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Witnesses told of chaos and
shock.

03:08.321 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

we were climbing
out, the train carriage
collapsed, all of

03:13.260 --> 03:14.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything went black.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I turned back and looked,
there was a
huge number of people lying
there.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were dead bodies.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was scary.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we left, they took out
several people
covered in blood.

03:25.238 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Russian President
Vladimir Putin
was in St. Petersburg at the
time.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hours later, he laid flowers at
the scene.

03:32.913 --> 03:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, President Trump
called the

thing.

In Colombia, the death toll from
a devastating

03:43.690 --> 03:49.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened late Friday in the
southern city
of Mocoa, after more than five
inches of rain

03:49.296 --> 03:51.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fell in one night.

03:51.364 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Workers are using heavy
machinery to clear
the thick mud and debris, so
rescue crews

03:55.936 --> 03:57.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can search for victims.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say deforestation
helped cause the
disaster.

04:01.908 --> 04:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

to South Carolina.

04:08.148 --> 04:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The same system generated

Masters golf tournament.

have announced
a $14 million initiative to
fight fake news.

04:29.536 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It follows allegations of
rampant Russian
disinformation during last
year's presidential

04:34.508 --> 04:36.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

Judy Woodruff spoke exclusively
today with
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg as
part of a

04:40.380 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
longer interview to air later on
the "NewsHour."

04:43.817 --> 04:50.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How concerned are
you that
Facebook was used this way by an
adversary

04:50.690 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country?

04:52.459 --> 04:55.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, Facebook:
There are
investigations of what happened
in the U.S.

04:55.662 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections that I think was going
on for a
long time.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
False news is a problem across
the board.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it comes from all kinds of
sources.

05:04.538 --> 05:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know it's bad for our
communities and
our governments and our
citizens.

05:08.375 --> 05:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it fair to say
that Facebook
underestimated the ability of a
foreign government

05:15.282 --> 05:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do something like this?

05:17.184 --> 05:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: We know that
seeing accurate
news on Facebook is really
important to people

05:21.821 --> 05:23.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all sides.

05:23.623 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter who you are, seeing
the accurate
story and seeing a diversity of
opinions is

05:28.662 --> 05:30.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really important.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know we have a
responsibility, along with
news rooms and classrooms and
academic and

05:34.801 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other companies, to make sure
people see accurate
news.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're working on a lot of
different levels.

05:39.606 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it fair to say
Facebook
was caught off-guard by this, by
the magnitude

05:43.243 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this?

05:44.711 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: As we have
grown, so much
has changed in the world.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So much has changed about the
way people share
with their friends.

05:51.618 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much has changed about the
way people share
with their families, and the way
people share

05:56.756 --> 06:00.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
articles and the kind of
articles people are
writing has changed.

06:00.327 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's up to us to work with
everyone involved,
so that we can make sure people
see accurate

06:05.899 --> 06:09.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news on Facebook, because that's
what they
want and that's what we want.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say
you're moving
to disrupt the financial
incentive, how are

06:13.340 --> 06:14.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you doing that?

06:14.674 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: A lot of false
news is financially
motivated.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are trying to make money
off this.

06:20.180 --> 06:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are making sure that
people who
are doing false news can't
participate in

06:25.485 --> 06:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our advertising network, so that
they can't
get money from our ads for doing
this.

06:29.856 --> 06:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also making sure that
people writing
these articles can't use our ad
system to

06:34.094 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advertise their content and get
more traffic.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

that's a record

07:38.925 --> 07:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

08:31.878 --> 08:33.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
You have a great friend and ally
in the United

08:35.315 --> 08:37.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States and in me.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Trump made
it clear he's
rebooting the U.S.-Egypt
relationship to focus

08:41.821 --> 08:43.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on fighting terrorism.

08:43.590 --> 08:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I just want to let
everybody
know, in case there was any
doubt, that we

08:47.427 --> 08:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are very much behind President
El-Sisi.

08:49.729 --> 08:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's done a fantastic job in a
very difficult
situation.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are very much behind Egypt
and the people
of Egypt.

08:57.637 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Egyptian
leader, facing
an Islamist insurgency in Sinai,
welcomed

09:02.575 --> 09:04.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's words.

09:04.310 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, Egyptian
President:
Since we met last September, I
have had a

09:10.517 --> 09:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deep appreciation and admiration
of your unique
personality, especially as
you're standing

09:16.756 --> 09:21.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very strong in the
counterterrorism field.

09:21.327 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your excellency, very strongly
and very openly,
you will find Egypt and myself
always beside

09:29.602 --> 09:31.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you in this.

09:31.704 --> 09:38.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Then Commanding
General El-Sisi
first assumed the presidency in
2013, when

09:38.411 --> 09:44.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he ousted the elected president,
Mohammed
Morsi, after mass protests
against Morsi's

09:44.050 --> 09:46.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rule.

09:46.586 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A harsh crackdown ensued on the
now-banned
Muslim Brotherhood, opposition
figures, journalists

09:53.026 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and others, leaving more than
1,000 dead.

09:55.695 --> 10:03.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tens of thousands more,
including some Americans,
were imprisoned, and many NGOs
have been banned.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
El-Sisi won his own election in
2014.

10:06.973 --> 10:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But President Obama shunned him,
and froze
military aid to Egypt for two
years.

10:12.378 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump made no public
mention of
human rights, noting only that
there are -- quote

10:17.750 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "a few things" -- unquote --
that Washington
and Cairo don't agree on.

10:22.489 --> 10:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a break with Mr. Trump's
track record
so far, they didn't hold a joint
news conference,

10:28.127 --> 10:31.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
precluding any unwelcome
questions on the
subject.

10:31.664 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later, White House Press
Secretary Sean Spicer
wouldn't say whether human
rights came up

10:36.970 --> 10:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the private discussions.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
That's best discussed privately
in terms of

10:41.708 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how we address areas that need
to be discussed
like that in order to make
progress on them.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that should be a
huge surprise.

10:48.882 --> 10:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Egypt currently
receives
$1.3 billion in annual U.S.
military assistance.

10:55.388 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unclear if that will
survive the White
House call for deep cuts in
foreign aid.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

11:03.897 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, how much of a
foreign policy
shift does today's meeting
represent?

11:09.035 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to Michele
Dunne.

11:11.070 --> 11:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has had a 17-year career at
the State
Department, where she focused on
Middle East

11:15.775 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's now director of the Middle
East Program
at the Carnegie Endowment for
International

11:20.446 --> 11:21.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Peace.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michele, thanks so much for
joining us.

11:23.249 --> 11:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By deemphasizing human rights
and trying to
-- as he -- as the
administration officials

11:28.688 --> 11:33.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are saying, reboot this
relationship, what
is President Trump trying to
accomplish?

11:33.159 --> 11:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is he trying to get out of
this?

11:35.061 --> 11:36.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHELE DUNNE, Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace: Well, I think what
President Trump

11:36.996 --> 11:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants is to construct a kind of
alliance of
Sunni Arab leaders, because Sisi
is one of

11:43.102 --> 11:44.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
several.

11:44.804 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was the -- the Iraqi prime
minister
was here in Washington very
recently, as was

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the deputy crown prince of Saudi
Arabia.

11:51.077 --> 11:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then right after President
Sisi will be
the king of Jordan.

11:54.047 --> 12:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that President Trump
has the idea
of sort of rallying Sunni Arab
leaders to

12:01.454 --> 12:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be used in various ways, whether
against ISIS,
against Iran, possibly in some
sort of peace

12:07.627 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effort toward Israel.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that's how he sees
Egypt fitting
in.

12:11.831 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And is he trying to
deemphasize
at least the public comments and
rhetoric

12:17.370 --> 12:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on human rights in order to
focus on this
fight on ISIS?

12:20.106 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE DUNNE: Well, yes,
clearly, that's
the case.

12:22.709 --> 12:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want to point out, John,
that's not
really new.

12:26.112 --> 12:30.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When I think back to the
beginning of President
Obama's presidency, when Mubarak
was still

12:30.450 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in power in Egypt, Obama did
something very
similar.

12:33.853 --> 12:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama thought that George W.
Bush had been
too critical of Mubarak on human
rights and

12:39.592 --> 12:41.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he had wrecked the
relationship.

12:41.294 --> 12:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Obama sort of reset the
button with Mubarak
back at that time.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not unusual for a new
president to do
this.

12:49.535 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think, though, that
President Trump
is going to figure out in time
is that the

12:54.140 --> 13:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation inside Egypt, human
rights abuses
at a very high level, much
higher than under

13:00.113 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mubarak, political repression
and a really
disastrous economic situation,
all of these

13:06.319 --> 13:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are really going to affect what
kind of an
ally Egypt can be to the United
States and

13:11.858 --> 13:17.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what kind of things we can do
together against
these regional problems such as
terrorism.

13:17.063 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Last week,
administration officials
in preparation for this visit
were telling

13:21.100 --> 13:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us that they felt that it was
better to talk
about human rights questions
privately and

13:28.041 --> 13:29.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discreetly.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that was the way they
felt they
could get the best results, best
chances for

13:32.612 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
success.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think about that?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE DUNNE: Well, we will
see.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say it's been tried
before and that
the two previous administrations
did try raising

13:40.920 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
things privately and,
eventually, out of frustration,
went a little bit more public.

13:45.925 --> 13:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even in both of the last
administrations,
they ended up withdrawing,
withholding or

13:51.030 --> 13:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspending certain kinds of aid
specifically
out of concerns about human
rights issues,

13:56.569 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they saw, at the end of
the day, that
that wasn't separate from the
stability of

14:00.473 --> 14:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Egypt or Egypt's role in the
region, that
it was all tied up together.

14:03.876 --> 14:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senators Lindsey
Graham and John
McCain have talked about putting
restrictions

14:09.115 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on aid to Egypt because of human
rights.

14:13.619 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think Congress will step
in and maybe
tie the president's hands a bit?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE DUNNE: Well, yes,
absolutely.

14:19.559 --> 14:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress has a lot to say,
particularly when
it comes to assistance, and some
of the senators

14:25.198 --> 14:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you mentioned and others have
already sent
a signal.

14:27.734 --> 14:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They put out a letter shortly --
a resolution,
rather, shortly before Sisi's
visit.

14:33.606 --> 14:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them have made press
statements
about there's a big crackdown on
NGOs in Egypt

14:38.745 --> 14:40.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

14:40.646 --> 14:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have indicated that
they will continue
to seek conditions on aid and
possibly even

14:46.452 --> 14:48.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a cutting of aid.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, John, I thought
one of the
most interesting things that
happened today

14:50.623 --> 14:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during this visit was an unnamed
administration
officials told a news service
that President

14:58.097 --> 15:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sisi, you know, has come seeking
an increase
in aid, and he's going to be
disappointed.

15:03.202 --> 15:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, talk about
that.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is President El-Sisi
looking for out
of this relationship?

15:08.441 --> 15:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE DUNNE: Well, look,
President El-Sisi,
as I mentioned, he faces a
difficult situation

15:13.312 --> 15:14.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inside of Egypt.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's much less popular than he
was.

15:17.383 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are starting to talk
about even whether
the military leadership is
pleased with him,

15:22.021 --> 15:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether they will want him to
run for president
again next year when his term
ends.

15:26.058 --> 15:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think he's looking to show
Egyptians
and especially show the Egyptian
military

15:31.397 --> 15:35.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that he can keep the
relationship with the
United States solid, he can keep
the aid coming

15:35.902 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we saw from the Trump
budget, they're
considering cutting a lot of
this aid or converting

15:41.607 --> 15:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it to loans, instead of grants.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that wouldn't serve Sisi's
purpose at all.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Trump administration is
putting out
hints that it may be going in
that direction.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michele Dunne, thanks
so much for
coming in and talking with us
about this.

15:54.754 --> 15:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHELE DUNNE: Thanks, John.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a pleasure.

15:56.756 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks.

16:07.733 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner, President Trump's
senior adviser
and son-in-law, was in Iraq
today.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was invited on the trip by
Joint Chiefs
chairman General Joseph Dunford.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The trip marks his first visit
to Iraq.

16:19.612 --> 16:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was joined by Tom Bossert,
the president's
homeland security adviser.

16:23.482 --> 16:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the three met with Iraqi and
American
officials to assess the fight
against ISIS.

16:28.354 --> 16:34.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The trip highlights the
expanding West Wing
role of both Kushner and his
wife, Ivanka

16:34.360 --> 16:35.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

16:35.361 --> 16:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Trump White House is a
family affair.

16:38.297 --> 16:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senior adviser and son-in-law
Jared Kushner
has emerged as a key West Wing
figure.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This week, his ever-expanding
role is on display.

16:46.806 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to his Iraq trip,
he's a key planner
of President Trump's upcoming
summit with

16:52.478 --> 16:54.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Xi Jinping.

16:54.547 --> 16:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His wife, Ivanka Trump, is now
an official
member of the White House staff
and assistant

16:59.886 --> 17:01.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the president.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House officials say she
will focus on
issues like women's economic
empowerment and

17:05.491 --> 17:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting more women into science
and technology.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier, she said she would pass
up an official
role.

17:11.697 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: People think that
you're going to
be part of the administration,
Ivanka.

17:15.034 --> 17:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVANKA TRUMP, Daughter of Donald
Trump: I'm
-- no, I'm going to be a
daughter, but I have

17:20.239 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said throughout the campaign
that I am very
passionate about certain issues
and that I

17:25.111 --> 17:26.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to fight for them.

17:26.913 --> 17:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there are a lot of things
that I feel
deeply, strongly about, but not
in a formal

17:31.684 --> 17:33.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
administrative capacity.

17:33.519 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Married in 2009, the
couple were
key members of the campaign's
inner circle.

17:37.256 --> 17:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Jared is a very successful real
estate person,

17:41.427 --> 17:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I actually think he likes
politics more
than he likes real estate.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm excited.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he's very good at politics.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Their increased
visibility comes
as the young administration has
run into significant

17:51.704 --> 17:53.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurdles.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH, The New York
Times: The reason
why I think they are starting to
increase

17:54.907 --> 17:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their footprint in the West Wing
and East
Wing is pretty simple.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is going wrong.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are a lot of power
vacuums.

18:02.915 --> 18:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question, I think, what do
these New Yorkers
bring to the table?

18:07.987 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Ivanka and Jared are not
people who have
had a lot of experience.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't have a lot of passion
for public
policy.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They just don't have a history
of that.

18:17.029 --> 18:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ethics watchdogs say
their unpaid
government service may be filled
with conflicts.

18:21.968 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Newly released financial
disclosure forms
show that Ivanka Trump has a
stake in the

18:26.172 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.,
of as much
as $25 million.

18:31.544 --> 18:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The couple still benefits from
their $740
million real estate and
investment business.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her jewelry and clothing lines
are currently
held in trust.

18:41.220 --> 18:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Ivanka Trump
said: "I have
been working closely and in good
faith with

18:45.658 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House counsel and my
personal counsel
to address the unprecedented
nature of my

18:50.930 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role."

18:52.431 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former associates say Kushner
could be a secret
weapon for Mr. Trump.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN KURSON, New York Observer:
One of his
greatest strengths is how much
people underestimate

18:58.938 --> 19:00.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

19:00.706 --> 19:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only is he young, and
soft-spoken, and
polite and very good-looking,
but he also

19:05.978 --> 19:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carries himself in a way that
sort of allows
people to think they're going to
potentially

19:13.652 --> 19:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get something over on him, and
then the next
thing they know, he's done just
fine for himself

19:18.858 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and his stakeholders.

19:20.826 --> 19:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even before last
week's announcement,
Ivanka Trump was granted a
high-level security

19:25.097 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearance and had a seat at the
table with
world leaders.

19:29.035 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The couple and their three
children live in
a rented $5.5 million D.C.
mansion, where

19:34.073 --> 19:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their neighborhoods include
former President
Barack Obama and Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson.

19:39.912 --> 19:44.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Like his father-in-law,
36-year-old Kushner
was born into a real estate
family and took

19:44.984 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the business into Manhattan.

19:46.886 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took over his family's
company after his
father was jailed for tax
evasion and other

19:51.757 --> 19:53.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
offenses.

19:53.592 --> 19:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He graduated from Harvard and
got a joint
law and business degree from New
York University.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also owned The New York
Observer.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When he joined the
administration, he resigned
from all professional roles and
announced

20:03.803 --> 20:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he would sell the paper to a
family trust.

20:06.672 --> 20:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like her father, Ivanka Trump,
who is 35,
graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania's

20:11.544 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wharton School of Business.

20:13.579 --> 20:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a brief stint as a model,
she joined
the Trump organization,
eventually becoming

20:17.783 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an executive vice president.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is their first foray into
politics and
government.

20:23.155 --> 20:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH: The Bush White
House, the Obama
White House were stocked with
experienced

20:27.226 --> 20:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who had careers as public
servants.

20:30.763 --> 20:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Trumps came in with the
promise to
change that paradigm and make
the White House

20:36.168 --> 20:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
function more along the lines of
a business.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, remember, these are not
enormously successful
businesspeople.

20:42.274 --> 20:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As their profiles and
influence
rise, so do reports of tensions
with chief

20:47.146 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategist Stephen Bannon and
some of the
populist conservatives in the
West Wing.

20:52.284 --> 20:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House officials deny any
friction, calling
Kushner the ultimate team
player.

20:57.623 --> 21:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Outside critics noted that
Ivanka and Kushner
were on a family ski trip when
the president's

21:02.528 --> 21:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempt to repeal and replace
the Affordable
Care Act faltered.

21:06.499 --> 21:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House officials say it was
not an issue
either of them was working on.

21:11.370 --> 21:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kushner's also been caught up in
the investigation
of ties between the Trump circle
and Russia.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's agreed to meet with the
Senate Intelligence
Committee about arranging
meetings with Russian

21:20.146 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officials during the transition.

21:23.149 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether President Trump's bet on
his family
pays off is an open question.

21:27.453 --> 21:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given how close they are to Mr.
Trump, White
House officials say they are
crucial to the

21:32.691 --> 21:38.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president's success.

21:38.564 --> 21:45.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

21:45.204 --> 21:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
solutions to
India's growing garbage problem;
in search

21:49.775 --> 21:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a fairer America, a selection
from the
"NewsHour" bookshelf; and we
visit an Irish

21:55.047 --> 21:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poet's monthly variety show.

21:57.349 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, for more on Jared
Kushner's role
in the White House, the fight
over Supreme

22:02.354 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and
the week ahead
for President Trump, it's time
for Politics

22:07.293 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

22:12.364 --> 22:17.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just heard a little
discussion about
the role that Jared Kushner and
Ivanka Trump

22:18.003 --> 22:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are playing in the West Wing.

22:19.772 --> 22:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you make of this, of
this sort of
increased role for this very
young couple?

22:24.577 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
and Jared Kushner especially has
sort of an

22:28.113 --> 22:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
amorphous and growing portfolio.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's liaising with the Mexican
government.

22:33.552 --> 22:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's preparing for the visit
from President
Xi from China.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's off in Iraq.

22:39.024 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's supposed to lead this
task force,
SWAT team to potentially
completely reshape

22:44.597 --> 22:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the federal government and find
deficiencies.

22:46.498 --> 22:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a lot and it's a unique
role.

22:49.535 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, unlike other
advisers who are
jockeying for a position in this
White House,

22:55.708 --> 22:56.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's hard to fire your
son-in-law.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would be a little awkward.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He probably still could do that.

23:00.946 --> 23:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, every president
does get to
come in with someone or multiple
people who

23:05.751 --> 23:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the closest to them who they
trust to
only be looking out for them.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a vicious town.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot of knives are out.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need someone that always has
your back.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama had Valerie
Jarrett, who came
from Chicago.

23:18.530 --> 23:19.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She was for him.

23:19.965 --> 23:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She stayed with him throughout
the entire
course of his presidency.

23:24.203 --> 23:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She didn't have a portfolio
quite as big as
his, but it was a pretty diverse
portfolio.

23:28.107 --> 23:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you would see her show up in
places that
were important to the president,
always looking

23:31.644 --> 23:33.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out for the president's
interests.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question in my mind is not
so much what
are they doing, but can they do
something,

23:37.249 --> 23:38.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

23:38.984 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we going to see success or
any change
or anything come out of this big
portfolio?

23:45.190 --> 23:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where I would be
spending a lot
more time focusing, not so much
the fact that

23:49.328 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he went to Iraq, but is there
going to be
a change in the way that the
administration

23:54.667 --> 23:56.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deals with Iraq?

23:56.435 --> 23:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there going to be a way that
is going to
be different about what happens
with China

23:59.271 --> 24:01.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or these other measures of this
portfolio?

24:01.807 --> 24:05.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is much more significant
than the fact
that he's actually sitting
there.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And he was invited
by the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
which gives

24:08.847 --> 24:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an indication that the chairman
of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff might feel that
this is a

24:12.618 --> 24:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good way to get a message to the
president,
that, if he can deliver
information to a person

24:18.057 --> 24:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has the president's ear,
that is a way
of getting into that inner
circle.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And having him go out
there, he
is essentially serving as the
president's

24:25.397 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eyes and ears.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, the Joint Chiefs gets
to sit with
Jared Kushner, the person the
Times Square

24:31.770 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closest to the president, for 16
straight
hours.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a lot of time to do some
lobbying.

24:36.642 --> 24:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, now the -- Neil
Gorsuch cleared
the Senate Judiciary Committee,
but we have

24:42.815 --> 24:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really set the stage for this
fight over filibusters,
over how many votes it takes to
get a Supreme

24:48.520 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Court nominee.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How ugly is this going to get,
Tam?

24:51.957 --> 24:55.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The Senate is
already on a path
to the nuclear option.

24:55.794 --> 25:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They started on that path when
Harry Reid
and the Democrats decided to do
the nuclear

25:01.266 --> 25:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
option for other presidential
appointees,
other judicial nominations, up
to, but not

25:07.573 --> 25:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including the Supreme Court.

25:09.375 --> 25:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they said they had to do
that because
of the observation of Mitch
McConnell, who

25:13.712 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was then in the minority.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, we were headed here.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a collision course.

25:20.419 --> 25:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were going to get there
eventually,
whether it was this nominee or
the next nominee.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

25:25.457 --> 25:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would argue it has been a
collision
course that has been set even
far before 2013,

25:30.562 --> 25:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hollowing out of moderates
in Congress,
the fact that there are no
longer Southern

25:37.369 --> 25:40.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats, Northeastern
Republicans, folks
who are willing to cross party
lines.

25:40.606 --> 25:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole reason you have the
60-vote threshold
was really to build consensus.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is no ability to build
consensus.

25:48.247 --> 25:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no reward you get as a
politician
now to crossing party lines, to
being a bipartisan

25:54.787 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal-maker.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it brings you two
things, one, a
likely primary challenge from
your left or

25:59.792 --> 26:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your right, and it ensures that
you have a
harder time raising money from
the donors

26:04.363 --> 26:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are excited about the
polarization and
the partisanship.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I totally agree we were
headed here anyway.

26:09.568 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it were not with Gorsuch, it
would be if,
in the next two years, we had
another Supreme

26:13.305 --> 26:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court opening, we would have
seen that fight
there.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I think all bets are off.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is this going to
change the Senate,
or is the Senate already
changed?

26:22.948 --> 26:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think this is
where the Senate
has been going.

26:26.285 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't see this -- look, the
real change
would be if we do see more and
more opportunities

26:33.025 --> 26:37.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for getting rid of the
filibuster in traditional
legislative business.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it feels as if we're headed
there, too.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That it just
started to snowball.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are a lot of
institutionalists in the
Senate, senators who are very
sad about this.

26:45.504 --> 26:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was a tiny effort at a
nuclear disarmament,
and it really didn't go
anywhere.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you want to know what
this can do,
look at President Trump's
Cabinet picks.

26:56.949 --> 27:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the first president
post-nuclear option
to name his Cabinet.

27:02.087 --> 27:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And someone like Betsy DeVos
simply wouldn't
have been confirmed if there had
been the

27:07.426 --> 27:08.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
filibuster.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody like a Scott Pruitt at
the EPA wouldn't
have been confirmed.

27:12.397 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Simply, there wouldn't have been
60 votes
for those people.

27:15.834 --> 27:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president didn't have to
find consensus
candidates because he knew that
he only needed

27:21.106 --> 27:22.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
51 votes.

27:22.875 --> 27:27.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: In the grand
tradition of Friday
night document dumps, we got the
financial

27:27.079 --> 27:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disclosure forms for the Trump
administration.

27:30.582 --> 27:31.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did we find?

27:31.583 --> 27:32.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did we learn?

27:32.718 --> 27:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I don't know that we
learned anything
new.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We learned that there are some
really wealthy
people that are in this
administration.

27:36.922 --> 27:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You pointed out in your piece
the connection
of the Kushners with the Trump
properties.

27:42.861 --> 27:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think for folks who
already believe
that there is too much of a
connection between

27:49.368 --> 27:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump business and Trump
administration,
those came true in this.

27:55.941 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, at the end of the
day, for Democrats
and those who are opposed to
Donald Trump,

28:00.312 --> 28:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea that just because you
have wealthy
people in your administration is
going to

28:03.682 --> 28:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make people fear that those
folks aren't going
to look out for the interests of
non-wealthy

28:08.587 --> 28:10.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people isn't on mark.

28:10.355 --> 28:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we have to wait and
see is, what
do their policies do for people
who don't

28:15.260 --> 28:16.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have all of this money?

28:17.029 --> 28:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If indeed, at the end of the
day, what we
find is the policies that Trump
are putting

28:20.265 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward or passing only benefit
a small section
of America, those who are the
wealthiest,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then that argument will hold
water.

28:27.272 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they pass middle-class tax
cuts, if they
do things to help lower-income
Americans,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is going to be harder to make
that argument.

28:33.745 --> 28:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And people who
wanted to make
the argument could point to the
health care

28:36.615 --> 28:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill that cut taxes on the
wealthy and would
have cut Medicaid substantially.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Had many people
saying, wait,
the president ran as a populist.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is this health care bill?

28:46.258 --> 28:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But people earned a
lot of money
last year in the Trump
administration.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There were a lot of big
paychecks.

28:54.299 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One aide got a free wedding
dress from a reality
TV show.

28:59.171 --> 29:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are just sort of -- I don't
know that
there's any grand policies
things you can

29:03.642 --> 29:05.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
glean from these things.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're just sort of very
interesting little
nuggets about the people that
he's chosen

29:08.747 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be in the White House.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: This is an
administration like
no other.

29:12.250 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, what supporters of
President Trump will
say is that's what he ran for.

29:16.622 --> 29:17.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what he said.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said, I'm a super rich guy.

29:19.658 --> 29:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other rich people have run for
president before,
and they sort of ran away from
their wealth

29:23.128 --> 29:24.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or didn't flaunt it.

29:24.896 --> 29:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, I'm a rich guy, I'm
going to bring
my rich friends, and we're going
to change

29:29.534 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the government.

29:30.535 --> 29:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And we will see how
they do.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

29:33.138 --> 29:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, thanks
joining us, Politics Monday.

29:36.508 --> 29:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

29:42.180 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now: a look at how
the world's
second most populous country is
trying to

29:50.022 --> 29:51.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with pollution.

29:51.857 --> 29:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro looks
at how Delhi, India, is trying
to cope with

29:56.862 --> 30:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tons of municipal waste in a
city of more
than 20 million.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred's report is part of our
Breakthrough
series.

30:04.236 --> 30:11.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In India's
capital, new
housing sprawls as far as the
eye can see,

30:11.109 --> 30:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a symbol of the world's fastest
growing major
economy.

30:14.846 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There also are towering symbols
of the environmental
cost of all this.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just look for the birds.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under thousands of hovering
vultures are the
city's landfills.

30:27.859 --> 30:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of three covering
some 70 acres
in a low-income area called
Ghazipur.

30:34.166 --> 30:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm standing near the top of the
Ghazipur
landfill site, an accumulation
by now of more

30:39.171 --> 30:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 10 million tons of waste.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's more than 10 stories high.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Behind me, it towers over the
surrounding
skyline.

30:47.312 --> 30:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And trucks are all around here,
bringing in
an additional 2,000 tons of
unsorted garbage

30:53.952 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHESH BABU, Business Owner: You
can't dump
more in that mountain there.

30:57.989 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Mahesh Babu
heads an infrastructure
company that's been contracted
by Delhi's

31:02.794 --> 31:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government to tackle a trash
problem that
he says is a crisis at many
levels.

31:07.766 --> 31:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: Keep in mind Delhi
is on the
seismic zone.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, you are really...

31:13.405 --> 31:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: If you had
an earthquake
here, God forbid.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAHESH BABU: Yes.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have an earthquake, you will
have that
mound just sliding down.

31:19.044 --> 31:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And even
without an earthquake,
he says the festering garbage is
toxic.

31:24.349 --> 31:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Methane from the dump explodes
daily in dozens
of spontaneous fires that spew
toxins into

31:30.322 --> 31:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the air, while a stew of heavy
metals and
organic and inorganic pollutants
washes into

31:36.061 --> 31:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the soil when it rains and into
Delhi's main
river.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: Yes, the dark
liquid right here
is what we call leachate.

31:43.168 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Babu showed
me a sample
of this so-called leachate.

31:47.239 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: What we do is
basically treat
it, so that it removes all the
toxic impurities.

31:53.445 --> 32:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But of the
millions of
tons that are not treated yet,
this is the

32:00.552 --> 32:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stuff that's going into the
Yamuna River.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: Especially during
monsoon.

32:04.422 --> 32:09.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
centerpiece of his
company's approach is a year-old
$60 million

32:09.094 --> 32:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power plant that converts waste
to energy,
which is sent to the electric
grid.

32:14.065 --> 32:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is ramping up to burn 2,000
tons of trash
per day, which means the city
may not need

32:19.638 --> 32:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to add to the landfill, though
it won't immediately
reduce its size.

32:23.508 --> 32:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: India has close to
50 cities
which are more than a million
people.

32:27.913 --> 32:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, waste energy of this kind
makes a lot
of sense in those kind of
settings.

32:32.484 --> 32:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This isn't
the first attempt
at creating energy from waste.

32:36.755 --> 32:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And previous ones haven't
worked, says Delhi-based
environmental activist Sunita
Narain.

32:42.027 --> 32:46.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNITA NARAIN, Environmental
Activist: The
key reason for failure has been
the inability

32:46.698 --> 32:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sort and segregate the waste
which is then
used for incineration.

32:52.404 --> 32:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if you don't sort and
segregate adequately,
you both have very toxic
emissions that come

32:59.110 --> 33:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the plant, but you also
have very poor
quality of fuel that is
generated.

33:04.549 --> 33:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ideally that
kind of sorting
should happen in homes,
organics, metals,

33:09.754 --> 33:11.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
paper and plastics.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Narain says there's a
cultural hurdle.

33:13.692 --> 33:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Waste has been the domain of
people on the
lowest rung of the age-old
social hierarchy,

33:18.697 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or caste system, not the middle
classes who
generate most of it.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUNITA NARAIN: We are a
caste-ist society.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we would like to treat waste
as somebody
else's problems.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You get it out of your home, and
then somebody
else deals with it.

33:32.377 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The state is never asking us to
segregate.

33:36.047 --> 33:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it doesn't put the onus and
the responsibility
on households.

33:39.818 --> 33:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Instead, the
government
pays a higher rate for
electricity coming

33:43.822 --> 33:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the Ghazipur plant, so
workers can
be hired to segregate the refuse
when it gets

33:48.560 --> 33:49.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

33:49.828 --> 33:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once sorted, Babu says,
there's plenty
of added value.

33:53.331 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: We're looking at
converting biodegradables
into organic fertilizer.

33:57.936 --> 34:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The combustibles, we convert
into energy.

34:01.239 --> 34:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the idea is really to glean
as much value
as possible from this.

34:05.677 --> 34:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In time, he
says, there
are plans by his company and
others to chip

34:10.081 --> 34:15.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
away at the landfill and
actually reduce its
size, repurposing some of the
waste as road

34:15.654 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction material, for
instance.

34:18.690 --> 34:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the plant, combustible trash
is dried and
incinerated.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Babu says the effluent passes
through sophisticated
filters and scrubbers.

34:26.631 --> 34:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: Our particulate
matter is less
than 10 parts per million, which
is the standard

34:31.236 --> 34:33.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Europe.

34:33.138 --> 34:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, because we're located so
close to these
houses here, the idea is to
ensure that whatever

34:37.809 --> 34:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes out of our stack is
absolutely clean
and clear.

34:41.279 --> 34:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Neighbors
invited to the
power plant say they have
already seen an

34:45.050 --> 34:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improvement since it became
operational, a
massive buffer between their
homes and the

34:49.888 --> 34:51.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dump site.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Before, you got
out of the house and looked at a
huge pile

34:55.026 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of garbage.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now we look at this.

34:57.662 --> 35:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
really was
unbearable during the rainy
season.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was so smelly and dirty.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we can even have the door
open and sit
outside.

35:06.938 --> 35:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But for
another nearby
community, the power plant
represents a threat.

35:11.609 --> 35:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of so-called rag
pickers forage for
plastics, glass and any reusable
items they

35:17.315 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can sell, risking their health
and the wrath
of authorities to eke out a
livelihood.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not legally supposed to
be here.

35:25.890 --> 35:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them, the company has set up
a preschool
and an arts and craft center.

35:32.664 --> 35:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The petals of discarded flowers
from a nearby
florist are used to create
greeting cards

35:37.435 --> 35:38.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other artwork.

35:38.870 --> 35:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mahesh Babu hopes more rag
pickers will choose
the new alternative.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says helping these
marginalized people
is in his company's interest.

35:47.712 --> 35:51.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHESH BABU: We believe that,
unless they
are mainstreamed, the
profitability of the

35:51.983 --> 35:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
main project is always under a
cloud.

35:55.053 --> 36:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everywhere possible, we have
tried to integrate
people into our mainstream
project itself,

36:01.026 --> 36:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that then they have a sense
of ownership.

36:03.661 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, we have a number of
people who
will and try to bring the
project to a halt.

36:07.665 --> 36:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they are part of the
project, the chances
of success increase
exponentially.

36:12.137 --> 36:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In the long
term, he and
environmentalists agree that
projects like

36:17.342 --> 36:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this have to succeed, and that
will require
a broad cultural shift.

36:22.213 --> 36:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country has no more room to
bury its trash,
Babu says, and runs of risk of
being buried

36:28.319 --> 36:29.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by it.

36:29.687 --> 36:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in New Delhi.

36:33.458 --> 36:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Fred's reporting is a
partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

36:38.263 --> 36:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

36:45.070 --> 36:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: a new book by the one-time
manager of
John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign
in West Virginia,

36:56.147 --> 37:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a founder of the Peace Corps and
the editor
of the storied Washington
Monthly.

37:00.952 --> 37:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charles Peters takes on modern
America in
"We Do Our Part: Toward a Fairer
and More

37:06.257 --> 37:07.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Equal America."

37:07.992 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here again is Judy Woodruff, who
sat down
with Peters recently and asked
him, why this

37:12.564 --> 37:14.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
book, why now?

37:14.432 --> 37:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS, Author, "We Do
Our Part: Toward
a Fairer and More Equal
America": I was terribly

37:16.234 --> 37:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned about the things that
had taken
us apart, from a country that
was relatively

37:24.843 --> 37:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together during the time I was
growing up.

37:27.512 --> 37:33.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Franklin Roosevelt era, I
would say, lasted
roughly until 1965.

37:33.985 --> 37:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only were incomes becoming
more equal,
but the country was becoming
more equal, in

37:41.426 --> 37:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sense that blacks were
achieving legal
rights that they had never
known.

37:47.065 --> 37:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our Jewish prejudice was
radically diminished
by the mid-'60s.

37:52.237 --> 37:56.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And our Catholic prejudice
almost disappeared.

37:56.207 --> 38:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was a country that seemed
to be coming
together.

38:01.346 --> 38:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then just a few years later,
the Vietnam
War began to split us apart.

38:06.718 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You launched a
magazine in
the late 1960s, you said,
because you wanted

38:11.289 --> 38:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at what the federal
government was
doing right, and what it was
doing wrong,

38:15.160 --> 38:16.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how it could do better.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you soon expanded that to
look at the
whole country.

38:18.663 --> 38:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS: We felt we had
to get into
those broader cultural issues.

38:24.702 --> 38:31.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the main thing that happened
was the snobbery
that began with the anti-war
movement.

38:31.442 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was, I think, one of two
really bad things
that happened to divide the
country.

38:38.416 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other was the growth of
greed and the
conspicuous consumption that
fueled the greed.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Snobbery.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

38:46.758 --> 38:50.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not a word
that's thrown
out a lot.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you --
who do you
mean by what happened?

38:53.198 --> 38:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS: In the anti-war
movement,
there was a feeling that the
people who were

38:58.303 --> 39:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the war were morally
superior to those
who were for the war.

39:04.275 --> 39:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I was against the war, but
I understood
there were an awful lot of good
people who

39:10.515 --> 39:12.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
believed in the war.

39:12.417 --> 39:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when I began to worry
about what was
going wrong with the anti-war
movement, even

39:18.122 --> 39:20.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
though I was part of the
anti-war movement.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You point out a
number of ways
in which the country, for all of
its progress,

39:23.895 --> 39:24.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has gone downhill.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And another way
is, you cite
the greed that you saw crop up
among people

39:29.567 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington who came here
originally to
do public service, but then that
changed.

39:35.039 --> 39:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS: Even though it
contained that
element of snobbery, that was
also a beautiful

39:40.612 --> 39:43.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
element of idealism in the
anti-war movement.

39:43.615 --> 39:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that gradually changed in
the '70s.

39:46.951 --> 39:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think part of it was simply
these people
were getting older.

39:50.755 --> 39:51.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The V.W.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Beetle was no longer the
adequate car.

39:53.625 --> 39:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had to get the station
wagon, and then
they had to get the house.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But then they got the house.

40:00.198 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they got -- it had to
be a larger
house, and it had to have a
workout room,

40:04.769 --> 40:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it had to have a home
office, and it had
to have walk-in closets and
state-of-the-art

40:09.607 --> 40:11.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bathroom and kitchen.

40:11.676 --> 40:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, suddenly, people were into
thinking they
needed a lot of money.

40:16.114 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they forgot about the
wages paid
to the worker.

40:20.818 --> 40:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They became concerned with
increasing their
dividends, meaning increasing
profits.

40:27.191 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they read about a plant
closing,
well, that might increase
profit, you know?

40:33.064 --> 40:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got to watch those
wages, because
wages take away from profit.

40:38.503 --> 40:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You see running
through this
entire book, Charlie Peters, a
cautionary

40:43.908 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tale, especially for Democrats,
I think, who
have argued that they are the
party of the

40:50.381 --> 40:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working people, that they are
the party of
equal rights, equal access, of
tolerance.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

40:59.023 --> 41:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
something
was eating away at that from the
inside.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

41:03.261 --> 41:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shame of that is, in many
ways, the Democrats
were becoming more inclusive,
more generous.

41:09.801 --> 41:14.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were including the causes
of gays.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were including the cause of
immigrants.

41:17.809 --> 41:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're far more generous
towards those
people than the Republicans in
general.

41:24.615 --> 41:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there was much that was
going on that
was in the best of the
Democrats.

41:32.590 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this failure on wages, the
failure to
concern themselves with the
interest of the

41:40.365 --> 41:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worker, this is where the
liberals failed.

41:42.567 --> 41:48.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of the theme
of the book,
it seems to me, is how the
Democratic Party

41:48.206 --> 41:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has let you down, that you
thought there was
-- that the party could do
better than it's

41:53.311 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS: It's let the
country down
in that respect.

41:56.848 --> 42:01.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I am still a Democrat, proud
to be a Democrat.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I -- on the whole, we're on the
right side.

42:05.089 --> 42:11.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in these two ways of getting
too involved
with making money ourselves --
we're too involved

42:11.329 --> 42:14.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in thinking we're a little bit
better than
the other guy.

42:14.966 --> 42:19.971 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
When they were
environmentalists, they didn't
think, whose jobs are this going
to cost?

42:20.004 --> 42:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they worked for a certain
trade policy,
they didn't think, who is this
going to cost,

42:24.475 --> 42:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what can I do to help those
people this
is going to hurt?

42:28.646 --> 42:30.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's an
indictment of Hillary
Clinton.

42:30.648 --> 42:31.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PETERS: Yes.

42:31.816 --> 42:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Unfortunately, yes.

42:33.618 --> 42:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key symbolic thing that is
going to happen
now is what Barack Obama decides
to do with

42:37.955 --> 42:39.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest of his life.

42:39.590 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he decides to just concern
himself with
getting rich, it will be
terrible.

42:45.096 --> 42:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need a symbolic leader to
say, stop, I
want to get off the greed and
conspicuous

42:52.837 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consumption that are sinking
this country.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're 90.

42:56.808 --> 43:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The book is a story of the last
half-century
or more in Washington and of
this country,

43:01.479 --> 43:04.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"We Do Our Part: Toward a Fairer
and More
Equal America."

43:04.649 --> 43:10.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Charlie Peters, thank you very
much.

43:10.788 --> 43:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLES PETERS: Thank you, Judy.

43:15.893 --> 43:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Next: It's called a
picnic, but
instead of hotdogs and potato
salad, this

43:22.800 --> 43:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one features poetry and music.

43:25.336 --> 43:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown met up with its
creator and
master of ceremonies, poet Paul
Muldoon.

43:31.809 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There was music
from the Irish
musical duo the lost Brothers,
storytelling

43:44.789 --> 43:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from novelist Nicholson Baker.

43:46.491 --> 43:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLSON BAKER, Novelist: I was
in a laundromat.

43:47.492 --> 43:50.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was a laundromat in
Marseille, France.

43:50.094 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Marseille.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you hear that?

43:52.296 --> 43:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a mattress of a word.

43:54.932 --> 43:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EILEEN MYLES, Poet: This one's
basically talking
to my computer.

43:59.103 --> 44:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And there was
poetry by Eileen
Myles.

44:02.006 --> 44:03.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EILEEN MYLES: You.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all these years, you
should know my
font.

44:06.210 --> 44:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You should know the numbers go
in the middle.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What'd I say?

44:12.216 --> 44:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Muldoon's Picnic
is an old-fashioned
variety show, the brainchild of
poet Paul

44:17.522 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muldoon, held monthly at the
Irish Art Center
in Manhattan.

44:20.324 --> 44:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON, Muldoon's Picnic:
While our
drugs of choice were run from
Istanbul through

44:25.196 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a girl called Joyce, whose real
name was Mule.

44:28.966 --> 44:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what's your
role here?

44:31.402 --> 44:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're sort of the impresario?

44:33.304 --> 44:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: Sort of impish
impresario.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Impish, yes.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL MULDOON: Of course,
everyone is stuck
in their own little world these
days.

44:40.845 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has to do with people
making their own
amusement, or at least opening
themselves

44:46.918 --> 44:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the possibility, I suppose,
of amusement
being of a somewhat more direct
nature, you

44:56.761 --> 45:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, the poem, the short story,
the song.

45:00.765 --> 45:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Muldoon is an
Irish-born, renowned
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet,
Princeton Professor,

45:07.371 --> 45:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poetry editor of "The New
Yorker," and front
man for the band Rogue Oliphant.

45:12.243 --> 45:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Picnic revives a popular New
York vaudeville
variety show from the 1880s.

45:17.815 --> 45:23.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it begins with an even older
tradition
of poetry as an oral art form to
be performed.

45:23.287 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: Certainly, in the
Irish tradition,
there is no distinction, for
example, between

45:29.360 --> 45:30.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the poem and the song.

45:30.895 --> 45:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the great poems in the
Gaelic tradition
were, coincidentally, songs.

45:37.168 --> 45:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's the
difference between
writing lyrics for a song and
writing a poem?

45:44.175 --> 45:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: They're akin as
activities,
but they're distinct.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're both using words,
obviously.

45:51.549 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the song lyric is missing
something.

45:58.222 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's missing an element, which
will bring
it to its -- what it most may be
in the world.

46:06.364 --> 46:08.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the music.

46:08.065 --> 46:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to try to write a song lyric
is difficult
for me, and I think many people,
because,

46:14.905 --> 46:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I'm writing a poem, my
impulse is to
be perfect, is to achieve
perfection.

46:19.477 --> 46:20.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which means what?

46:21.012 --> 46:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: Which means that
it is unassailable.

46:23.681 --> 46:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is -- there is not a word out
of place
in it.

46:27.718 --> 46:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And it doesn't
need music to
complete it.

46:30.421 --> 46:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: It doesn't need
music, because
some wise wag once said it
brings its own

46:35.426 --> 46:37.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
music.

46:37.328 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Muldoon's poetry
is famously
filled with its own music,
metaphors and allusions.

46:42.466 --> 46:46.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A new selected poems was
recently published.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked what effect he strives
for.

46:48.773 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: Contrary to what I
think many
people feel, many people feel
art is about

46:55.613 --> 46:58.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
salve, about peace.

46:58.282 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I myself am looking for
something quite different.

47:02.787 --> 47:04.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm looking for trouble.

47:04.955 --> 47:06.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm looking for...

47:06.257 --> 47:08.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: No rest, not
rest, trouble.

47:08.793 --> 47:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL MULDOON: Well, you know,
trouble is the
mode of the world.

47:14.098 --> 47:18.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the mode of the world, and
to be equal
to the mode of the world, I
think, in a strange

47:18.669 --> 47:28.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, to be able to represent
unrest, and to
be able to bring together the
elements, the

47:28.279 --> 47:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chemical components that, when
they combine,
do have some kind of combustion.

47:36.087 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And at Muldoon's
Picnic, you
can get your poetry with a
musical performance.

47:44.395 --> 47:50.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Irish Art Center in
Manhattan, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

47:50.835 --> 47:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The next performance
of Muldoon's
Picnic will be held in New York
a week from

47:57.541 --> 47:59.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tonight, on April 10.

47:59.376 --> 48:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that
caught our eye that may be of
interest to

48:13.557 --> 48:15.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

48:15.359 --> 48:20.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An image of a man listening to a
gramophone
in his bombed-out Aleppo home
recently went

48:20.231 --> 48:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
viral, captured by Agence
France-Presse photographer
Joseph Eid while on assignment
in Syria.

48:26.537 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We recently spoke to him via
Skype about the
photo and about the man at its
center.

48:31.942 --> 48:38.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH EID, Agence
France-Presse: Well, Mr.
Mohammed, his full name, it's
Mohammed Mohiedin

48:38.215 --> 48:39.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Anis.

48:39.216 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they call him Abu Omar.

48:40.985 --> 48:47.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw that this is a very
educated person,
he speaks five languages, he
five years of

48:47.725 --> 48:52.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medicine in Spain, and he
inherited a great
wealth from his parents.

48:52.596 --> 48:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's one of the richest, very
wealthy people
of Aleppo.

48:56.333 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Omar has a very strong
inclination
to collect old and vintage cars,
especially

49:03.107 --> 49:06.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American-made ones from the '40s
and '50s.

49:06.911 --> 49:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he told us that how he lost
everything
now and how he was willing to
restart again

49:11.682 --> 49:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from ashes, how an old man, a
70-year-old
man, that he is willing to go
back again and

49:18.589 --> 49:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reopen his firm and to
restore his house
and to fix his cars, that he
calls they are

49:25.329 --> 49:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
injured and they are crying now,
they are
weeping.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we went also up to the
master bedroom.

49:32.570 --> 49:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we were there, we barely
could walk amongst
the rubble there inside.

49:38.209 --> 49:39.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we asked him.

49:39.777 --> 49:40.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's still living there.

49:40.778 --> 49:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's still sleeping amongst the
rubble.

49:43.080 --> 49:44.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's amazing.

49:44.448 --> 49:45.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't believe.

49:46.016 --> 49:49.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yusef (ph), the videographer,
asked him, the
phonograph is still operating?

49:49.787 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "Well, it's the only
thing that still
operates here."

49:53.390 --> 49:55.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, he said: "Wait.

49:55.726 --> 49:56.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will show you.

49:56.861 --> 49:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will let you listen to one of
my favorite
discs."

49:58.929 --> 50:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he ended up explaining
about the song,
he just -- like, he was
transferred.

50:06.670 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was puffing on his pipe and
looking out
from the window.

50:12.343 --> 50:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he put his one leg over one
another, and
just like he was by himself
listening to the

50:18.916 --> 50:22.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
music, without taking notice
that we are around
him.

50:22.553 --> 50:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That moment, like, I was like
electroshock.

50:25.122 --> 50:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he didn't notice that I was
taking pictures
of him.

50:27.658 --> 50:30.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was like in another era.

50:30.094 --> 50:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went back to his old good
times, I think.

50:35.799 --> 50:41.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The destruction, the rubble, the
windows,
and the light even which struck
from the left,

50:41.906 --> 50:43.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was so dramatic, you know?

50:44.008 --> 50:48.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it touched me, and I took
the image.

50:48.112 --> 50:53.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are fed up from violence,
from killing,
from beheading, from ISIS.

50:53.717 --> 50:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been hearing it on a
daily basis.

50:56.687 --> 51:03.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think this image that it
shows the human
being in Syria, and it gives
also a message

51:03.928 --> 51:05.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of hope.

51:05.596 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told us: "No matter what
happens to me
or to Syria, I'm not leaving
here.

51:11.669 --> 51:14.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's here where I born, and I'm
not leaving."

51:14.471 --> 51:19.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the strong thing about
it, is determination
to live.

51:19.510 --> 51:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tonight on PBS,
"Independent Lens"
presents a film about the
horrific 2012 mass

51:26.450 --> 51:29.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in
Connecticut.

51:29.653 --> 51:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took the lives of 20 school
children and
six educators.

51:33.791 --> 51:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newtown uses never-before-heard
testimonies
from parents, siblings,
teachers, and first-responders

51:40.464 --> 51:45.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they talk about their grief,
anger and
disbelief in the months and
years after the

51:45.903 --> 51:48.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media left their small town.

51:48.806 --> 52:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We just kind of waited,
and then they
brought the children out, and it
was heartbreaking

52:00.784 --> 52:01.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to see them.

52:01.919 --> 52:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were all holding hands in a
line.

52:07.858 --> 52:18.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw Michail (ph) come,
and, true to
his personality, I think he was
skipping and

52:18.202 --> 52:19.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
holding somebody's hand.

52:19.269 --> 52:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he said; "Mom, I didn't cry.

52:23.340 --> 52:28.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't cry."

52:29.013 --> 52:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his teacher came behind, and
she had a
wild look on her face, and he
said, "They

52:35.786 --> 52:36.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heard it all."

52:36.854 --> 52:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She said, "They heard it all.

52:42.059 --> 52:43.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They heard the guns.

52:43.394 --> 52:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They heard the screaming, but
they heard it
all."

52:46.530 --> 52:53.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: "Newtown" premieres
tonight on
most PBS stations.

52:53.570 --> 52:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now, we recently
caught up with Bill Nye, The
Science Guy,

52:58.075 --> 53:00.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of a major conference of
science teachers.

53:00.778 --> 53:04.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talks about encouraging
students' passion
for learning and much more.

53:05.015 --> 53:10.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can watch that interview on
our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:10.254 --> 53:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:12.022 --> 53:16.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, we will have a look
at the legal
and ethical issues surrounding
the use of

53:16.493 --> 53:18.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cameras in the classroom.

53:18.495 --> 53:21.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would they better protect
special needs students
and teachers?

53:21.732 --> 53:22.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

53:22.900 --> 53:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
