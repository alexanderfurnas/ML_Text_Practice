JUDY WOODRUFF: After days of
setbacks, a Cabinet
nominee dropping out, a resigned
national

00:07.608 --> 00:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security adviser, and a court
rejection of
his travel ban, President Trump
went on the

00:12.813 --> 00:14.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
offensive today.

00:14.748 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At a 77-minute-long news
conference, he rejected
charges of ties between his
campaign and Russia,

00:21.588 --> 00:26.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
blasted the intelligence
community for leaks,
and repeatedly attacked the news
media.

00:26.226 --> 00:31.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said he inherited
a mess at
home and abroad, but he
dismissed the notion

00:31.531 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a White House in turmoil.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I turn on the TV, open the
newspapers and

00:36.270 --> 00:38.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see stories of chaos.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Chaos.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yet it is the exact opposite.

00:42.209 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This administration is running
like a fine-tuned
machine, despite the fact that I
can't get

00:52.185 --> 00:54.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my Cabinet approved.

00:54.488 --> 00:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me list to you some of the
things that
we've done in just a short
period of time.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just got here.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I got here with no Cabinet.

01:03.196 --> 01:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, each of these actions is
a promise
I made to the American people.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I will go over just some of
them.

01:09.870 --> 01:15.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a lot happening next
week and
in the weeks --in the weeks
coming.

01:15.342 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We've withdrawn from the
job-killing disaster
known as Trans-Pacific
Partnership.

01:20.714 --> 01:25.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to make trade deals,
but we're
going to have one-on-one deals,
bilateral.

01:25.986 --> 01:30.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've undertaken the most
substantial border
security measures in a
generation to keep

01:30.857 --> 01:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our nation and our tax dollars
safe, and are
now in the process of beginning
to build a

01:36.163 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
promised wall on the southern
border.

01:38.498 --> 01:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The price is going to come down
just like
it has on everything else I have
negotiated

01:43.270 --> 01:44.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the government.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are going to have a wall
that works.

01:46.873 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to have a wall
like they have
now, which is either nonexistent
or a joke.

01:51.645 --> 01:56.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've begun preparing to repeal
and replace
Obamacare.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obamacare is a disaster, folks.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's disaster.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I know you can say, oh,
Obamacare.

02:02.489 --> 02:09.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they fill up our alleys
with people
that you wonder how they get
there, but they

02:09.997 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not the Republican people
our that representatives
are representing.

02:14.634 --> 02:21.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we've begun preparing to
repeal and replace
Obamacare, and are deep in the
midst of negotiations

02:21.875 --> 02:28.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a very historic tax reform to
bring our
jobs back, to bring our jobs
back to this

02:28.382 --> 02:29.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country, big league.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's already happening, but big
league.

02:31.985 --> 02:37.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have kept my promise to the
American people
by nominating a justice of the
United States

02:37.624 --> 02:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court, Judge Neil
Gorsuch, who is
from my list of 20, and who will
be a true

02:44.765 --> 02:51.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defender of our laws and our
Constitution,
highly respected, should get the
votes from

02:51.271 --> 02:52.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Democrats.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You may not see that.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he'll get there one way or
the other.

02:56.343 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This last month has represented
an unprecedented
degree of action on behalf of
the great citizens

03:02.783 --> 03:03.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of our country.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Again, I say it.

03:05.519 --> 03:12.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There has never been a
presidency that's done
so much in such a short period
of time.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have not even started the
big work
yet.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That starts early next week.

03:16.997 --> 03:21.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
also faced
repeated questions about Russian
contacts

03:21.168 --> 03:27.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with officials in his campaign
and about firing
National Security Adviser Mike
Flynn.

03:27.107 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported
this evening
Flynn denied to the FBI last
month that he

03:32.379 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussed lifting sanctions with
the Russian
ambassador, but intercepted
communications

03:38.151 --> 03:39.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indicate he did.

03:39.686 --> 03:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a
fine person,
and I asked for his resignation.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He respectfully gave it.

03:47.994 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a man who there was a
certain amount
of information given to Vice
President Pence,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who is with us today.

03:56.837 --> 04:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was not happy with the way
that information
was given.

04:01.441 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't have to do that,
because what he
did wasn't wrong -- what he did
in terms of

04:08.582 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the information he saw.

04:11.451 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was wrong was the way that
other people,
including yourselves in this
room, were given

04:16.857 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that information, because that
was classified
information that was given
illegally.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the real problem.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: What will you do on
the leaks?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You've said twice today...

04:26.366 --> 04:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, we're looking
at them very
-- very, very serious.

04:28.135 --> 04:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have gone to all of the folks
in charge
of the various agencies, and
we're -- I have

04:33.707 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually called the Justice
Department to
look into the leaks.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are criminal leaks.

04:39.746 --> 04:44.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're put out by people either
in agencies
-- I think you'll see it
stopping because

04:44.918 --> 04:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now we have our people in.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, again, we don't have
our people
in because we can't get them
approved by the

04:49.823 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Did you direct Mike
Flynn to discuss
sanctions with the Russian
ambassador...

04:54.327 --> 04:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I didn't.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: ... prior to your...

04:56.596 --> 04:57.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I didn't.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: ... inauguration?

04:58.665 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I didn't.

04:59.666 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: And then fired him...

05:00.734 --> 05:01.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:03.170 --> 05:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I fired him
because of what
he said to Mike Pence.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very simple.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mike was doing his job.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was calling countries and his
counterparts.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it certainly would have been
OK with me
if he did it.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would have directed him to do
it if I thought
he wasn't doing it.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't direct him, but I would
have directed
him because that's his job.

05:18.952 --> 05:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: During the campaign,
did anyone
from your team communicate with
members of

05:23.390 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russian government or
Russian intelligence?

05:24.524 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if so, what was the nature
of those conversations?

05:27.494 --> 05:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I can tell
you, speaking
for myself, I own nothing in
Russia.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have no loans in Russia.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have any deals in
Russia.

05:40.106 --> 05:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Putin called me up
very nicely to
congratulate me on the win of
the election.

05:45.312 --> 05:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then called me up extremely
nicely to congratulate
me on the inauguration, which
was terrific.

05:51.918 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But so did many other leaders,
almost all
other leaders from almost all of
the countries.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's the extent.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia is fake news.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia -- this is fake news put
out by the
media.

06:03.363 --> 06:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The false reporting by the
media, by you people,
the false, horrible, fake
reporting makes

06:09.803 --> 06:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it much harder to make a deal
with Russia.

06:13.773 --> 06:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And probably Putin said, you
know -- he's
sitting behind his desk, and
he's saying,

06:19.179 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, I see what's going on
in the United
States.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I follow it closely.

06:23.817 --> 06:28.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be impossible for
President
Trump to ever get along with
Russia because

06:28.722 --> 06:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all the pressure he's got
with this fake
story, OK?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Is Putin testing you,
do you believe,
sir?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't think
so.

06:35.895 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Putin probably assumes
that he can't
make a deal with me anymore
because politically

06:40.100 --> 06:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be unpopular for a
politician to
make a deal.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't believe I'm saying I'm a
politician,
but I guess that's what I am
now.

06:45.805 --> 06:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, look, it would be much
easier for
me to be tough on Russia, but
then we're not

06:49.476 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to make a deal.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I don't know that we're
going to make
a deal.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We might.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We might not.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it would be much easier for
me to be so
tough -- the tougher I am on
Russia, the better.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you know what?

07:00.553 --> 07:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to do the right thing for
the American
people.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to be honest, secondarily, I
want to do
the right thing for the world.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: I was just hoping that
we could
get a yes-or-no answer on one of
these questions

07:12.399 --> 07:14.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involving Russia.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you say whether you are
aware that anyone
who advised your campaign had
contacts with

07:18.071 --> 07:19.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia during the course of the
election?

07:19.806 --> 07:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I told you,
General Flynn
obviously was dealing.

07:22.976 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's one person.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he was dealing, as he should
have been.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: During the election?

07:26.713 --> 07:27.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: No.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody that I know of.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nobody...

07:30.083 --> 07:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So you're not aware of
any contact
during the course...

07:30.884 --> 07:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Look, look,
look...

07:31.685 --> 07:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: ... of the election?

07:33.053 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How many times do
I have to
answer this question?

07:33.920 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Can you just say yes
or no?

07:34.688 --> 07:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know you have to get up and
ask a question.

07:36.723 --> 07:37.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so important.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But Russia is a ruse.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have nothing to do with
Russia.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haven't made a phone call to
Russia in years.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't speak to people from
Russia.

07:45.865 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not that I wouldn't.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just have nobody to speak to.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I spoke to Putin twice.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He called me on the election.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I told you this.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he called me on the
inauguration, a few
days ago.

07:56.109 --> 08:03.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We had a very good talk,
especially the second
one, lasted for a pretty long
period of time.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure you probably get it
because it was
classified.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm sure everybody in this
room perhaps
has it.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we had a very, very good
talk.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have nothing to do with
Russia.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the best of my knowledge, no
person that
I deal with does.

08:16.763 --> 08:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump also
defended his
ban on travelers from seven
mostly Muslim

08:22.736 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nations.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been blocked in federal
court.

08:25.438 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Justice Department
announced that
the order will be rescinded.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said that a new
one is coming,
and he addressed the fate of
immigrant children

08:33.913 --> 08:37.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shielded from deportation under
the so-called
DACA program.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you
about the travel
ban.

08:40.954 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a very smooth rollout of
the travel
ban.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we had a bad court.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Got a bad decision.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had a court that's been
overturned.

08:49.596 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, may be wrong, but I think
it's 80 percent
of the time, a lot.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had a bad decision.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to keep going with
that decision.

08:56.469 --> 09:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to put in a new
executive order
next week some time.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we had a bad decision.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what I wanted to do was do
the exact
same executive order, but said
one thing.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said this to my people.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Give them a one-month period of
time.

09:12.619 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But General Kelly, now Secretary
Kelly, said,
if you do that, all these people
will come

09:19.125 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a month, the bad ones.

09:21.027 --> 09:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do agree there are bad
people out there,
right, that not everybody that's
like you.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have some bad people out
there.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Kelly said you can't do
that.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was right.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as he said it I said,
wow, never thought
of it.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said how about one week?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said, no good.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You got to do it immediately,
because, if
you do it immediately, they
don't have time

09:39.746 --> 09:40.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come in.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, nobody ever reports that.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's why we did it
quickly.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Can you give us
more details
on the executive order you plan
for next week?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Even its broad outlines?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Will it be
focused on specific...

09:50.790 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's a very fair
question.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: .. countries?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in addition, on the DACA
program for
immigration.

09:54.727 --> 09:55.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Right.

09:55.728 --> 09:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: What is your
plan?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you plan to continue that
program or to
end it?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
show great heart.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DACA is a very, very difficult
subject for
me, I will tell you.

10:04.337 --> 10:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, it's one of the most
difficult subjects
I have, because you have these
incredible

10:08.274 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids, in many cases, not in all
cases.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some of the cases, they're
having DACA,
and they're gang members, and
they're drug

10:14.747 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dealers, too.

10:16.182 --> 10:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have some absolutely
incredible kids,
I would say mostly.

10:21.354 --> 10:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were brought here in
such a way -- it's
a very -- it's a very, very
tough subject.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to deal with DACA
with heart.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to deal with a lot of
politicians,
don't forget, and I have to
convince them

10:32.665 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that what I'm saying is -- is
right.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I appreciate your
understanding on that.

10:38.671 --> 10:45.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the DACA situation is a
very, very -- it's
a very difficult thing for me,
because, you

10:45.912 --> 10:47.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know, I love these kids.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love kids.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have kids and grandkids.

10:50.884 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I find it very, very hard
doing what the
law says exactly to do, and you
know, the

10:56.456 --> 10:57.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law is rough.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not talking about new laws.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm talking the existing law is
very rough.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very, very rough.

11:03.329 --> 11:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as the new order, the new
order is
going to be very much tailored
to the -- what

11:08.768 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I consider to be a very bad
decision.

11:10.837 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we can tailor the order to
that decision
and get just about everything,
in some ways

11:15.708 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're tailoring it now to
the decision,
we have some of the best lawyers
in the country

11:20.780 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working on it.

11:22.582 --> 11:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the new executive order is
being tailored
to the decision we got down from
the court.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

11:32.125 --> 11:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Russia and
other topics,
the president's scorn of news
coverage was

11:35.562 --> 11:37.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on full display.

11:37.330 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He insisted news organizations
are giving
a skewed, negative view of his
actions and

11:41.768 --> 11:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are woefully out of touch with
the country.

11:44.103 --> 11:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Many of our
nation's reporters
and folks will not tell you the
truth, and

11:51.778 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will not treat the wonderful
people of our
country with the respect that
they deserve.

11:55.415 --> 12:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope, going forward, we
can be a little
bit -- a little bit different,
and maybe get

12:01.354 --> 12:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
along a little bit better, if
that's possible.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe it's not, and that's OK,
too.

12:05.692 --> 12:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, much of the media
in Washington,
D.C., along with New York, Los
Angeles, in

12:10.697 --> 12:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular, speaks not for the
people, but
for the special interests and
for those profiting

12:18.204 --> 12:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off a very, very obviously
broken system.

12:23.443 --> 12:31.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The press has become so
dishonest that, if
we don't talk about it, we are
doing a tremendous

12:31.517 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disservice to the American
people.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tremendous disservice.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to talk about it, to
find out what's
going on, because the press
honestly is out

12:38.725 --> 12:39.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of control.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The level of dishonesty is out
of control.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will tell you something.

12:43.329 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will be honest, because I sort
of enjoy
this back and forth, and I guess
I have all

12:47.533 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my life, but I have never seen
more dishonest
media than, frankly, the
political media.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought the financial media
was much better,
much more honest.

12:55.208 --> 13:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will say that I never get
phone calls
from the media.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: You said that the
leaks are real,
but the news is fake.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I guess I don't understand.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems that there's a
disconnect there.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the information coming from
those leaks
is real, then how can the
stories be fake?

13:11.491 --> 13:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The reporting is
fake.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look, look...

13:13.493 --> 13:14.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:14.494 --> 13:15.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know what it
is?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the thing.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The public isn't -- you know,
they read newspapers,
they see television, they watch.

13:20.466 --> 13:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't know if it's true or
false, because
they're not involved.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm involved.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've been involved with this
stuff all my
life.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I'm involved.

13:29.976 --> 13:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I know when you're telling
the truth or
when you're not.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just see many, many untruthful
things.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will tell you what else I
see.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I see tone.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know the word tone.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The tone is such hatred.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm really not a bad person, by
the way.

13:45.258 --> 13:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, but the tone is such -- I do
get good
ratings, you have to admit that
-- the tone

13:50.530 --> 13:52.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is such hatred.

13:52.298 --> 13:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at your show that goes
on at 10:00
the evening.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just take a look at that
show.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a constant hit.

13:59.639 --> 14:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The panel is almost always
exclusive anti-Trump.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The good news is, he doesn't
have good ratings.

14:05.311 --> 14:09.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the panel is almost
exclusive anti-Trump.

14:09.315 --> 14:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the hatred and venom coming
from his mouth,
the hatred coming from other
people on your

14:15.688 --> 14:16.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
network.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, I will say this.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm actually having a very good
time, OK?

14:19.325 --> 14:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they will take this news
conference -- don't
forget, that's the way I won.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, I used to give you a
news conference
every time I made a speech,
which was like

14:25.531 --> 14:26.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

14:26.933 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, they will say, Donald
Trump rants
and raves at the press.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not ranting and raving.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm just telling you.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, you're dishonest
people.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But -- but I'm not ranting and
raving.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love this.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm having a good time doing it.

14:39.112 --> 14:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, tomorrow, the headlines are
going to
be, Donald Trump rants and
raves.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, I want to see an honest
press.

14:46.753 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I started off today by
saying that it's
so important to the public to
get an honest

14:51.457 --> 14:52.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
press.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The press -- the public doesn't
believe you
people anymore.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, maybe I had something to do
with that.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they don't believe you.

14:59.866 --> 15:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were straight and really
told it like
it is, as Howard Cosell used to
say, right?

15:06.405 --> 15:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, he had some questions
also.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, if you were straight, I
would be your
biggest booster.

15:12.578 --> 15:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be your biggest fan in
the world,
including bad stories about me.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if you go -- as an example,
you're CNN.

15:20.286 --> 15:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's story after story
after story
is bad.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I won.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I won.

15:28.127 --> 15:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
went on to say,
"This is going to be a bad
question," before

15:31.764 --> 15:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling on reporter April Ryan
of American
Urban Radio Networks.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN, American Urban Radio
Networks:
When you say the inner cities,
are you going

15:38.971 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- are you going to include the
CBC, Mr. President,
in your conversations with your
-- your urban

15:43.643 --> 15:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agenda, your inner city agenda,
as well as...

15:45.578 --> 15:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Am I going to
include who?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: Are you going to
include the Congressional
Black Caucus and the
Congressional...

15:49.782 --> 15:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I tell you what.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you want to set up the
meeting?

15:52.785 --> 15:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: ... Hispanic Caucus?

15:53.786 --> 15:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Do you want to set
up the meeting?

15:54.787 --> 15:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: No -- no -- no.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not...

15:56.789 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Are they friends
of yours?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: I'm just a reporter.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, then, set up
the meeting.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: I know some of them,
but I'm sure
they're watching right now.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Let's go set up a
meeting.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would love to meet with the
Black Caucus.

16:03.362 --> 16:03.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's great, the
Congressional Black
Caucus.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's great.

16:05.565 --> 16:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually thought I had a
meeting with Congressman
Cummings, and he was all
excited.

16:11.404 --> 16:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then he said: Well, I can't
move.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It might be bad for me
politically.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't have that meeting.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was all set to have the
meeting.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, we called him and
called him.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was all set.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke to him on the phone,
very nice guy.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: I hear he wanted
that meeting
with you as well.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He wanted it.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the
record, the Congressional
Black Caucus says it has been
asking to meet

16:30.289 --> 16:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the president, but never
received a response.

16:33.392 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That leads us to our final
highlight: an exchange
where Mr. Trump was called out
for making

16:38.231 --> 16:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
another false statement.

16:40.099 --> 16:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We got 306,
because people came
out and voted like they've never
seen before,

16:46.205 --> 16:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so that's the way it goes.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess it was the biggest
Electoral College
win since Ronald Reagan.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: You said today that
you had the
biggest electoral margin since
Ronald Reagan

16:53.479 --> 16:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with 304 -- 306 electoral votes.

16:57.617 --> 17:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, President Obama got
365...

17:03.189 --> 17:04.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:04.891 --> 17:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: President Obama 332,
and George
H.W. Bush 426 when he won as
president.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why should Americans trust
you...

17:12.365 --> 17:13.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:13.699 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I was told --
I was given
that information.

17:14.967 --> 17:15.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

17:15.968 --> 17:16.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was just given it.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had a very, very big margin.

17:18.771 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: I guess my question
is, why should
Americans trust you when you
have accused

17:25.144 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the information they've received
of being
fake, when you're providing
information that

17:26.145 --> 17:27.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is...

17:27.546 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't
know, I was given
that information.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was given -- actually, I've
seen that information
around.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was a very substantial
victory.

17:30.816 --> 17:31.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you agree with that?

17:31.817 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: You're the president.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: OK.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And our own
Lisa Desjardins
joins us now from the White
House.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, one of the things that he
said about
General Michael Flynn, that he
wasn't hesitating

17:41.594 --> 17:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fire him, partly because he
had a replacement
in mind.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the latest we know about
that?

17:45.131 --> 17:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

17:46.899 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do have some news, as it
seems we can't
get two minutes today without
more news.

17:51.570 --> 17:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CBS and The Financial Times are
reporting
that General Roger -- Robert
Harward, who

17:56.776 --> 18:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the Trump choice to replace
Michael Flynn
-- he's a U.S. Navy SEAL, former
admiral,

18:02.014 --> 18:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retired admiral -- has declined
to take that
position.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that leaves a major, key
position in the
White House still to be filled.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House seems to be
searching.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have asked the White House
for comment
on that.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have not gotten back to us,
but the reporting,
that Trump's choice to replace
Flynn has declined

18:16.729 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to take the job.

18:18.497 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa, also, at
the top of
this press conference today was
actual news

18:21.334 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president wanted to
make, which was
the nomination of the
replacement candidate

18:25.171 --> 18:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Department of Labor.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another name,
another very
important name that was
overlooked today.

18:29.875 --> 18:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alexander Acosta is the man who
Mr. Trump
would like lead the Labor
Department.

18:35.414 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know a lot about him.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has quite a pedigree.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, he has served himself
as a U.S. attorney.

18:40.653 --> 18:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also was the first Hispanic
to serve as
an assistant attorney general,
covering civil

18:46.058 --> 18:47.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, he was on the National
Labor Relations
Board.

18:49.228 --> 18:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That in particular is important,
because that's
his main qualification, as far
as we know,

18:53.432 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for this labor job.

18:55.201 --> 19:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Currently, he's the dean of the
College of
Law at the Florida International
University.

19:00.573 --> 19:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be first Hispanic on
President Trump's
Cabinet.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're waiting for reaction from
Capitol Hill
to his name.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is well-known here.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing the White House
likes, Hari,
in particular, is that he's gone
through the

19:11.717 --> 19:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmation process before the
Senate three
times.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, one of
the things I
want to follow up on is
something that you

19:17.056 --> 19:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were asking the president today.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's happening, what is the
latest with
the executive order?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, such a
critical piece
of information.

19:23.162 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, as we played for
our audience,
said he will have a new order
out next week.

19:28.768 --> 19:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems that this next order is
an attempt
to almost replicate the past
order, but line

19:34.573 --> 19:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it up so that it passes some
kind of court
muster.

19:38.277 --> 19:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also seems, reading
between the lines
-- and I have one source
indicating that they

19:43.082 --> 19:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not figured out exactly how
to do that
yet.

19:45.418 --> 19:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why it hasn't been
released yet, the
White House still designing this
executive

19:49.488 --> 19:50.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But pay attention to Mr. Trump's
words today,
Hari.

19:52.591 --> 19:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that this is
extreme vetting,
that they had to move up more
quickly because

19:57.830 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Ninth Circuit ruling.

19:59.632 --> 20:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is something they were
looking at
more long-term that they seem to
be incorporating

20:03.669 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into an executive order next
week.

20:05.504 --> 20:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't seem like it's all
the way fully
baked, but it's going to be
significant when

20:09.275 --> 20:10.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it comes.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa, finally,
why did they
have this today?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did they have this press
conference, briefly?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think there
were a lot
of reasons, obviously, just the
headlines

20:16.649 --> 20:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves and the White House
struggling
to respond to them.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wanted to get the president
out himself
to do it.

20:21.487 --> 20:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also a sense in
this White House
that the president does best on
his feet and

20:25.925 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these kind of very engaging
formats.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you could tell, he said
himself, as we
played, he was enjoying the
back-and-forth

20:31.330 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the press.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it was a lot of that.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa
Desjardins joining
us from the White House, thanks
so much.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You got it.

20:37.436 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for two
different viewpoints
on today's news conference, I am
joined by

20:42.441 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kansas Secretary of State Kris
Kobach.

20:45.111 --> 20:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was an adviser to Mr. Trump
during his
presidential campaign and
transition.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Washington Post columnist
Ruth Marcus.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the program to
both of you.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ruth, I'm going to start with
you.

20:57.356 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first sort of
wide-ranging, full-blown
news conference we have seen
from this president

21:02.294 --> 21:03.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in several weeks.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you make of it overall?

21:05.798 --> 21:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS, Columnist, The
Washington Post:
It was, as everybody has been
saying, an extraordinary

21:09.802 --> 21:10.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it had kind of three
audiences.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One audience was the president
himself.

21:17.343 --> 21:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he likes to do this sort
of government
by improv.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did campaign by improv.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now he's doing government by
improv.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could see him enjoying
himself.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it made him feel better.

21:28.621 --> 21:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is a core of Trump
supporters
who, as he said during the
campaign, he could

21:33.759 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are not rattled by anything
they have
seen.

21:39.865 --> 21:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're sticking with him, so
they're happy
to sort of see him back out
there being Trump.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought it was less successful
with the
third audience, which is the
most important.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a bunch of people who
are never
going to be for Trump.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most Democrats, polls show, will
never be
for Trump.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are Trump voters and
others who
are kind of wigglers who I think
would be

21:59.818 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very -- certainly not reassured
by this performance,
not being reassured by hearing
him say, contrary

22:05.958 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to all evidence, that this is a
well-functioning
machine that they're seeing in
the beginning

22:10.329 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this administration.

22:12.198 --> 22:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kansas Secretary
of State Kris
Kobach, was this a reassuring
news conference

22:16.302 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or something else?

22:18.204 --> 22:20.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
I think, to many conservatives,
many Republicans,

22:20.739 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was reassuring, in the sense
that this
was the first time we have seen
a president,

22:24.310 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a conservative president, really
express vocally
at a press conference the bias
he feels and

22:30.950 --> 22:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of us feel has been given
in the coverage
toward the Trump administration.

22:36.422 --> 22:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he's sort of holding the
press' feet
to the fire while he's taking
their questions.

22:41.126 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's combative.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's interesting.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you are going to see a
lot more people
turning in to these press
conferences.

22:47.433 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It used to be that conservatives
who were
in government, like myself, we
would get what

22:51.470 --> 22:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we felt was unfair coverage,
we'd go home,
we would grumble, we would
complain about

22:54.373 --> 22:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, but we actually wouldn't say
anything
to the reporter or to the
reporters while

22:58.210 --> 22:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're asking us additional
questions.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's very confrontational.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's refreshing.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think it actually is going
to be good.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the public is going
to take an
interest in these press
conferences much more

23:08.520 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so than in past presidencies.

23:10.489 --> 23:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, it is the
case this president
goes on about the press
virtually every chance

23:14.960 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he gets.

23:15.961 --> 23:16.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We heard that today.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It took up so much time in his
news conference.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and I know, as somebody --
we have covered
this for a long time.

23:21.600 --> 23:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every president feels that he
has gotten unfair,
dishonest coverage from the news
media.

23:28.507 --> 23:32.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is there something
quantitatively, qualitatively
different about the coverage of
this president?

23:32.878 --> 23:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Absolutely, both
quantitatively
and qualitatively.

23:36.582 --> 23:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other presidents behind the
scenes mutter
epithets about us.

23:40.653 --> 23:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He calls us the lowest form of
human life
to our face.

23:45.257 --> 23:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other presidents tried their
best to go around
the media that they don't think
are expressing

23:51.096 --> 23:52.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their views.

23:52.965 --> 23:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump just is -- is
just very, very
vocal about that and much more
-- spends much

23:59.071 --> 24:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more time being vocal about
that.

24:01.240 --> 24:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question that I have --
certainly, I agree
with Kris that this is must-see
TV.

24:07.346 --> 24:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're interested in ratings,
if that's
the test of a successful
presidency, this

24:11.717 --> 24:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is -- we're doing great here.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think that's the test.

24:15.087 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his basic argument was fake
-- to try
to distract from the Russia
story and the

24:20.859 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other bumps, you're all fake
news.

24:23.429 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it can't simultaneously be
that we're
really upset about leaks and the
news -- that

24:28.200 --> 24:29.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the leaked news is fake.

24:29.601 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's where I thought
his argument
really fell short.

24:32.738 --> 24:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Kris Kobach,
this notion that you can say all
day long

24:39.144 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you're getting dishonest
coverage, go
after the press, but, in the
end, does that

24:43.782 --> 24:44.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
help him govern?

24:45.017 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: Sorry.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I missed -- my earpiece -- I
missed the last
part.

24:49.154 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it help
President Trump
govern by spending so much time
criticizing

24:54.927 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the news media?

24:55.928 --> 24:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: So, that's a great
question.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I think it may.

24:58.831 --> 25:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And time will tell, because we
haven't really
seen a president challenging the
press' coverage

25:03.669 --> 25:05.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right after he gets it.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's remember, it's a mixed
bag.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are some programs.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think "PBS NewsHour" is very
balanced and
plays it down the middle, but
there are other

25:11.710 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
programs that do not.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think we will see if it
helps him
govern.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, the -- let's take
the example
of the travel ban.

25:18.717 --> 25:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that was characterized by
some media
outlets as a Muslim ban, which I
think is

25:23.555 --> 25:24.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an inaccurate term.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think most -- any fair
person would
agree that's inaccurate.

25:27.159 --> 25:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a temporary travel ban on
seven countries,
which have majority Muslim
population, but

25:32.197 --> 25:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are many, many other
countries, the
vast majority of the Muslim
world is not covered.

25:36.502 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's an example where
he then took
the press to task, said, no,
this is not fair

25:41.407 --> 25:42.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

25:42.741 --> 25:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think there has been more
accurate coverage
since then.

25:44.743 --> 25:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it may help him govern, but
I think it's
going to be case by case.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
In some cases, it will.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe, in some cases, it won't.

25:52.017 --> 25:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, clearly,
there were a
number of other questions about
contacts between

25:56.255 --> 25:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign and Russia.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He repeatedly said he wasn't
aware of any
such thing.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that put all those
questions to rest?

26:03.829 --> 26:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: The Trump
administration only
wishes that all those questions
are put to

26:08.167 --> 26:09.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rest.

26:10.002 --> 26:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we know is that he was
briefed about
contacts between the campaign
and intelligence

26:16.275 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

26:17.776 --> 26:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he's not aware of any,
but there are
clearly things out there.

26:24.049 --> 26:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got -- this story about
General Flynn,
who he says was terribly treated
by us in

26:29.922 --> 26:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the news media, yet he fired him
because he
was misleading about these
contacts.

26:35.160 --> 26:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're just beginning to
get the beginnings
of the story about what has
really happened

26:41.733 --> 26:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russia and with General
Flynn and possibly
with the Trump campaign.

26:45.704 --> 26:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Kris
Kobach, again
secretary of state of Kansas,
what about this

26:49.508 --> 26:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russia question, just quickly?

26:51.944 --> 26:57.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We did hear, as Ruth just said,
the president
said, I would have told my
national security

26:57.282 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser to be -- to go ahead and
talk to the
Russian ambassador about
sanctions.

27:02.321 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if that's the case, why was
that something
that we now know -- or
apparently Michael

27:10.395 --> 27:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flynn didn't level with the vice
president
and others about?

27:13.932 --> 27:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I think I heard the
question.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Correct me.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, I apologize for the
earpiece.

27:19.071 --> 27:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think the president is
relating what
he remembers and what he has
understood to

27:24.476 --> 27:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the communications that he's
aware of.

27:27.012 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he was very clear,
and I think
it's correct, that the reasons
for Mr. Flynn's

27:31.450 --> 27:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
departure -- General Flynn's
departure were
a matter of trust, not a matter
of any violation

27:36.488 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of any law or a regulation.

27:38.524 --> 27:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do think this particular
one is being
perhaps blown -- and I think the
president

27:43.161 --> 27:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was frustrated by the press
coverage, which
really seems to be making quite
a mountain

27:46.965 --> 27:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of maybe not a molehill, but
not a mountain,
blowing this particular
personnel question

27:53.539 --> 27:55.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way out of proportion.

27:55.073 --> 27:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he went on
for an hour
and 17 minutes.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Much more to discuss.

28:01.380 --> 28:07.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thank you both for being here,
Ruth Marcus,
Kansas Secretary of State Kris
Kobach.

HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The Senate narrowly confirmed
Congressman

28:20.265 --> 28:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mick Mulvaney to run the White
House Budget
Office.

28:23.268 --> 28:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Tea Party conservative from
South Carolina
was approved 51-49.

28:27.806 --> 28:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator John McCain joined all
48 Democrats
in voting no because of
Mulvaney's support

28:32.844 --> 28:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for defense spending cuts.

28:34.646 --> 28:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new budget chief also favors
trimming
entitlement programs like
Medicare and Social

28:39.952 --> 28:41.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Security.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president's
nominee for
ambassador to Israel says he's
sorry for some

28:44.790 --> 28:46.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his fiery rhetoric.

28:46.658 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Friedman apologized today
for inflammatory
criticism of President Obama and
Hillary Clinton

28:53.332 --> 28:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for calling a liberal Jewish
group -- quote
-- "worse than kapos."

28:57.502 --> 29:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a reference to Jews who
helped the
Nazis.

29:00.706 --> 29:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But several Democratic senators
challenged
Friedman over his language, as
they grilled

29:05.544 --> 29:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him at his confirmation hearing.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:08.647 --> 29:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN (D), Maryland: The
diplomat has
to choose every word that he or
she uses.

29:12.084 --> 29:19.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why should I believe that
these were just
emotional expressions and that
you now understand

29:19.791 --> 29:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the difference between that role
and that
as a diplomat?

29:24.129 --> 29:27.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRIEDMAN, U.S. Ambassador
to Israel
Nominee: If you want me to
rationalize it

29:27.132 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or justify it, I cannot.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These were hurtful words.

29:29.968 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I deeply regret them.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not reflective of my
nature or my
character.

29:36.908 --> 29:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Friedman has
strongly backed
Israeli settlements and opposed
Palestinian

29:42.180 --> 29:43.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statehood.

29:43.882 --> 29:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, he said he'd be
delighted if a
two-state solution can be
achieved.

29:47.586 --> 29:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the head of the Arab
League today
warned against moving the U.S.
Embassy to

29:53.125 --> 29:54.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jerusalem.

29:54.593 --> 29:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it would be explosive
for the situation
in the Middle East.

29:57.496 --> 30:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Islamic State

killing 130

30:02.267 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

30:04.069 --> 30:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Southern Pakistan, a suicide
bomber blew
himself up at a famous Sufi
Muslim shrine.

30:07.572 --> 30:12.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least 75 people died there,
and hundreds
more were wounded.

30:12.110 --> 30:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours earlier, in Iraq, a car
bomb ripped
through a Shiite neighborhood in
Baghdad.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The death toll there was at
least 55.

30:19.051 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Russia, a
Kremlin spokesman
warned today that political
turmoil in Washington

30:24.489 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has put a damper on improving
relations with
U.S.

30:28.460 --> 30:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Vladimir Putin
called for restoring
contacts between U.S. and
Russian intelligence

30:34.099 --> 30:35.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

30:35.967 --> 30:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Defense
Secretary James Mattis said the
U.S. is not

30:40.572 --> 30:42.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ready for any military
collaboration.

30:42.407 --> 30:46.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: Our
political leaders will engage
and try to find

30:46.845 --> 30:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
common ground or a way forward
where Russia,
living up to its commitments,
will return

30:52.217 --> 30:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a partnership of sorts here
with NATO.

30:56.421 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Russia is going to have to
prove itself
first and live up to the
commitments they

31:00.959 --> 31:03.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have made in the Russia-NATO
agreement.

31:03.128 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Mattis said
there is very little doubt that
the Russians

31:08.500 --> 31:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have interfered with elections
in a number
of countries.

31:11.737 --> 31:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Authorities in

31:16.274 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Korean leader's
half-brother.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was attacked Monday at a
Malaysian airport.

31:22.581 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local news accounts say North
Korean agents
poisoned him, but results of an
autopsy have

31:27.018 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not been released.

31:28.653 --> 31:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea's Kim Jong-un is

31:41.099 --> 31:46.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

DAVID LAWRENCE: Churchill blue.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can get this in a misty rose
for the ladies.

PAUL SOLMAN: David Lawrence
manages the Knox

the county

33:34.913 --> 33:36.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coroner.

33:36.581 --> 33:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been seeing a lot of dead
white males
of late, especially ages 45 to
54.

33:41.253 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LAWRENCE: A lot of it due
to alcohol
or drug abuse.

DR.

WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM, Family
Physician: There
has been a Denham practicing
medicine.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Craig Denham wears
multiple hats
too.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM: This small
bag is my
grandfather's medical kit.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A fifth-generation
Kentucky family
physician.

DR.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM: My
great-great-grandfather's.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: He's also medical
director for
the fire department's emergency
service.

DR.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM: In the
past two, two-and-a-half
years, we have had about a 300
percent increase

34:05.343 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the drug-related overdose
ambulance runs.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the prevalence of opiate
addiction in
this area continues to increase.

34:12.450 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BECKY MANNING, Widow: He's like,
mom, it's
nothing that you did.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's me.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Becky Manning's son
got hooked
on drugs.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fortunately, he's still alive.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: Almost 40 now.

34:22.027 --> 34:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But she blames the
drugs in part
for her husband's suicide.

34:24.763 --> 34:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: He just carried
this tremendous
guilt for everything, for our
son doing drugs.

34:31.336 --> 34:36.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then he started getting
depressed, and then
my husband took his own life.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How did he do it?

34:39.477 --> 34:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: He blew his head
off.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I came home to that.

34:43.882 --> 34:47.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Best friend Marcy
Conner's husband
also killed himself.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCY CONNER, Widow: He
developed alcoholism
very young in life.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: An addiction he
shared with lifelong
friends.

34:53.091 --> 34:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: One died with a
heart attack,
but drug use and alcohol use
played all the

34:58.763 --> 35:01.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way through his life.

35:01.066 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another one died of cancer,
drank up to the
very end.

35:07.405 --> 35:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my husband actually had a
G-tube in, a
feeding tube in, and poured
alcohol down his

35:15.046 --> 35:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feeding tube until he died.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BECKY MANNING: Alcohol
poisoning.

35:19.551 --> 35:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: These cases fit a
disturbing
national pattern.

35:23.221 --> 35:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though U.S. life expectancy has
been going
up steadily over the last
century, there's

35:29.594 --> 35:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now been a sudden and dramatic
reversal, for
just one demographic.

35:33.465 --> 35:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE, Economist: White
non-Hispanics
in America, middle-age, are
dying in large

35:38.370 --> 35:39.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
numbers.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON, Economist: It was
certainly
a huge surprise to me.

35:41.606 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economists Angus
Deaton and Anne
Case, who are married, published
their finding

35:45.443 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just after Deaton won the 2015
Nobel Prize
in economics.

35:53.385 --> 36:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The paper showed that, starting
in 1999, the
death rate of middle-aged white
Americans

36:00.325 --> 36:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been going up, instead of
down.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON: We thought we must
have made
an error.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, the whole world is
getting better.

36:06.765 --> 36:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This middle-aged group is the
one that's benefited
most, at least since 1970, from
advances in

36:13.405 --> 36:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the treatment of heart disease,
from people
quitting smoking, all of those
things.

36:17.409 --> 36:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then suddenly for this trend
that's going
down just to reverse out seemed
like it had

36:21.813 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be wrong.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it wasn't wrong.

36:24.649 --> 36:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The big increase
was in what
Case calls deaths of despair,
alcohol-related

36:29.454 --> 36:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
liver disease, suicide, drug
overdose.

36:33.058 --> 36:39.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANNE CASE: People kill
themselves slowly with
alcohol or drugs, or quickly
with a gun.

36:39.964 --> 36:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For people aged 50-55, for
example, those
rates went from 40 per 100,000
to 80 per 100,000

36:47.605 --> 36:50.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the turn of the century.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's people with a high
school degree
or less who are killing
themselves in these

36:53.978 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ways in large numbers.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the group that's getting
hammered.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:58.883 --> 36:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN KUMLER, Mason County
Health Department:
And now the CDC is paying more
attention to

36:59.584 --> 37:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that age group and demographic.

37:01.352 --> 37:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ellen Kumler, a
public health
doctor for Mason County,
Kentucky, says the

37:06.224 --> 37:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest data from the Centers for
Disease Control
pick up where the Case-Deaton
study leaves

37:11.563 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
off.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN KUMLER: When we look at
the suicide
rate, when we look at
unintentional injuries,

37:16.201 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot possibly related to
substance abuse,
as well as liver disease, the
rates of those

37:21.106 --> 37:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issues have actually increased.

37:23.041 --> 37:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Marcy Conner is a
nurse specializing
in substance abuse who has
experienced deaths

37:27.479 --> 37:30.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of despair time and again in her
own family.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: I had a brother
that committed
suicide, also.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And two cousins,
one of them
a nurse.

37:36.421 --> 37:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: And he started
telling me that
his depression medication wasn't
working as

37:42.093 --> 37:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, and pain medication wasn't
working as
well.

37:46.030 --> 37:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he lost his temper at work
one night and
got fired.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Got fired.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: They found him
hanging in his
garage.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the other
cousin?

37:59.944 --> 38:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: She overdosed.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And why so much
drug use and
abuse?

38:05.083 --> 38:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anne Case and Angus Deaton found
something
else in their study.

38:08.119 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE: Since at least the
mid-1990s, people's
reports of pain, of sciatic
pain, of neck

38:14.159 --> 38:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pain, of lower back pain year on
year have
increased.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Our best, strongest pain
medicines are
the opioids.

38:22.233 --> 38:27.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The mid-'90s was
also when the
opioid painkiller OxyContin was
approved by

38:27.839 --> 38:31.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the FDA, and began to be
marketed aggressively
to doctors.

38:31.442 --> 38:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They do not have serious
medical side
effects, and so these drugs,
which I repeat,

38:35.947 --> 38:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are our best, strongest pain
medications,
should be used much more than
they are for

38:40.919 --> 38:42.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
patients in pain.

38:42.921 --> 38:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Within five years,
the drug's
maker, Purdue Pharma, was
earning a billion-dollars-a-year

38:47.992 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
profit on OxyContin, which soon
rose to $3
billion.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As for the lack of serious side
effects?

38:55.633 --> 38:57.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, it did have one.

38:57.502 --> 39:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON: It's basically
heroin in a pill
with an FDA label on the front.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, people get addicted to this.

39:04.042 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON, Recovering
Painkiller Addict:
I started on oxycodone, or
OxyContin, in high

39:08.780 --> 39:09.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Elizabeth Easton is
now in recovery.

39:12.050 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: I unleashed
something horrid
in me many years ago from doing
one -- one

39:17.322 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pill.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went from taking them to
snorting them to,
yes, injecting, which is really,
really horrid.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because you have
got to have
it.

39:25.663 --> 39:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: You have to.

39:26.864 --> 39:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the only thing that makes
you feel normal.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's the farthest thing from
normal.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: It controls your
life.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're a different person.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's what Becky
Manning saw
in her son.

39:37.242 --> 39:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: Seeking and
finding the next
high was his priority, no matter
who he took

39:41.913 --> 39:43.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down with him.

39:43.348 --> 39:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: The brain is
telling you, I
have got to have it again.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I need more.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's where you end up with
that craving.

39:50.255 --> 39:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The craving ends up with, you
know, seeking
supply.

39:53.758 --> 39:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And though lawsuits
and a government
crackdown have helped curb the
supply of OxyContin,

39:59.764 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cheap heroin is more than
filling the void.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM: If you
can't get your
pain pills that you're abusing,
you're going

40:06.371 --> 40:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to find the source somewhere.

40:08.172 --> 40:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so people are turning to the
street drug
heroin, which is more dangerous,
in the sense

40:13.711 --> 40:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you're taking something
made in somebody's
garage vs. something made in a
factory.

40:17.715 --> 40:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUHM, Economist: In
many areas,
it's cheaper to get high on
heroin than it

40:21.352 --> 40:22.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would be to get drunk.

40:22.353 --> 40:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Chris
Ruhm.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUHM: This is a
major health crisis.

40:25.523 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, drug poisonings have
become the biggest
source of preventable premature
death.

40:31.229 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for example, there are more
drug poisoning
deaths than car crash deaths.

40:36.801 --> 40:37.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's quite recent.

40:37.802 --> 40:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And says Dr.
Denham:

40:38.803 --> 40:40.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:40.571 --> 40:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM: I'm seeing
just as many
middle-aged women as I am
middle-aged men.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bucking a
century-long improvement
in white longevity.

40:47.779 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LAWRENCE: People without
jobs and people
kind of just keeping themselves
secluded from

40:55.620 --> 40:57.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

40:57.455 --> 41:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting grimly

41:01.926 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Maysville, Kentucky.

41:03.695 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, next week,
Paul returns
to Maysville to ask the obvious
question:

41:09.267 --> 41:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why the startling increase in
deaths in white
America?

41:15.773 --> 41:27.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Many
restaurants and businesses
were closed today for a national
strike called

41:27.318 --> 41:29.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A Day Without Immigrants.

41:29.253 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The closures were an attempt by
participants
to show how crucial immigrants
are to American

41:33.758 --> 41:35.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

41:35.593 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, as we heard in his
press conference
today, immigration remains a
vital issue to

41:38.629 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

41:40.365 --> 41:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He campaigned promising to
deport millions
and to build a wall on the
Mexican border.

41:44.502 --> 41:49.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, last week, federal
immigration raids
in at least six states arrested
hundreds.

41:49.507 --> 41:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the immigration debate also
plays out
in the nation's so-called
sanctuary cities,

41:53.378 --> 41:58.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where local governments resist
cooperating
with federal immigration
officials.

41:58.282 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham went to
Austin, Texas, for a closer
look.

42:01.085 --> 42:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I, Donald John Trump, do
solemnly swear...

42:05.056 --> 42:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just a few
hours after Donald
Trump was sworn in as president,
another newly

42:10.194 --> 42:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected official, Sheriff Sally
Hernandez
of Travis County, Texas, posted
this video:

42:15.400 --> 42:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY HERNANDEZ, Travis County,
Texas, Sheriff:
I'm Sally Hernandez, your Travis
County sheriff.

42:18.770 --> 42:23.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The video laid
out her department's
policy change, which limits
cooperation with

42:23.508 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agents from ICE, Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

42:27.578 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hernandez says she doesn't want
her deputies
to be seen as ICE agents.

42:31.349 --> 42:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY HERNANDEZ: We in law
enforcement need
the cooperation of our
communities of color.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need them to be running to
us, and not
running away from us.

42:41.726 --> 42:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Travis County,
which includes
Austin, has an estimated 100,000
undocumented

42:47.465 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
immigrants, like Felix Jimenez.

42:50.067 --> 42:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sheriff says people like
Jimenez won't
trust police if they're
constantly afraid

42:55.072 --> 42:56.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of being deported.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Jimenez agrees.

42:58.543 --> 43:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FELIX JIMENEZ, Undocumented
Immigrant (through
translator): We're afraid when
we see a police

43:01.846 --> 43:02.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
officer.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're Hispanic.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We could be stopped for any
reason.

43:06.250 --> 43:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real fear that keeps me
nervous after
a long day is that I may not see
my children

43:10.888 --> 43:13.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I was stopped for only a
small infraction.

43:13.458 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY HERNANDEZ: We cannot
afford to make
our communities less safe by
driving people

43:18.830 --> 43:20.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the shadows.

43:20.665 --> 43:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sheriff
Hernandez won her
election promising to take this
very action,

43:24.268 --> 43:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but her critics have pounced,
saying she's
created Texas' first sanctuary
city, and deriding

43:30.041 --> 43:31.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her as Sanctuary Sally.

43:31.909 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG ABBOTT (R), Texas: We will
ban sanctuary
cities in Texas.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:37.181 --> 43:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Texas Governor
Greg Abbott
accused the sheriff of betraying
her oath,

43:40.251 --> 43:44.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling her argument frivolous,
shortsighted
and dangerous.

43:44.322 --> 43:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In retaliation, the governor
started cutting
$1.5 million in grants to Travis
County.

43:50.194 --> 43:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fund things like drug
courts and domestic
violence prevention.

43:52.964 --> 43:53.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

43:53.965 --> 43:54.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG ABBOTT: We are seeking
fines.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are seeking to withdraw more
state funds.

43:56.934 --> 44:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeking court orders that
compel these
officials like this sheriff to
comply with

44:01.706 --> 44:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the law or possibly go to jail
themselves.

44:04.542 --> 44:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Austin is now
among dozens
of so-called sanctuary cities
across the U.S.

44:09.814 --> 44:14.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While there's no official
definition for a
sanctuary city, the term
generally means local

44:14.719 --> 44:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police aren't turning in every
undocumented
immigrant to federal
authorities.

44:19.857 --> 44:23.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These cities have long drawn the
ire of President
Trump.

44:23.127 --> 44:25.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
During the campaign, he
threatened all of
them.

44:25.863 --> 44:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Block funding for
sanctuary
cities.

44:29.734 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We block the funding.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No more funding.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A promise he
kept soon after
taking office.

44:35.706 --> 44:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But mayors are pushing back.

44:37.642 --> 44:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY WALSH (D), Mayor of
Boston, Massachusetts:
We will not be intimidated by
the threat to

44:41.279 --> 44:43.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fed funding.

44:43.047 --> 44:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: I want
to be clear: We're going to stay
a sanctuary

44:44.115 --> 44:45.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New
York: We
are going to defend all of our
people, regardless

44:48.352 --> 44:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of where they come from and
regardless of
their documentation and status.

44:52.256 --> 44:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back in Texas,
state legislators
are trying to pass a law making
it illegal

44:57.328 --> 45:00.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for any city or county to limit
cooperation
with ICE.

45:00.798 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We are in a dangerous path
as a society,
so that's what this bill does
for

45:05.503 --> 45:09.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Senate Bill 4
would require
counties to determine the
immigration status

45:09.774 --> 45:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of everyone in their custody, as
well as honor
all requests from federal
immigration officials

45:15.379 --> 45:17.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to detain people indefinitely.

45:17.148 --> 45:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We just won't criminals
who are here
illegally and committing crimes
to stay in

45:23.020 --> 45:24.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our state.

45:24.355 --> 45:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Both sides
testified about
the proposed law.

45:26.424 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I do believe your bill is
unconstitutional,
on its face, actually.

45:30.962 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: State Senator
Charles Perry
introduced Senate Bill 4.

45:34.999 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill says state officials
who fail to
comply with the law would face
criminal prosecutions

45:40.204 --> 45:41.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and hefty fines.

45:41.639 --> 45:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES PERRY (R), Texas State
Senator: These
are attention-getters.

45:43.574 --> 45:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are, we're going to be
serious about
uniform, consistently without
prejudice, applying

45:47.678 --> 45:49.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the law to everyone.

45:49.480 --> 45:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how do
local police
interact with federal
immigration officers?

45:53.317 --> 45:57.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, when someone is
arrested in any
location in the U.S., they're
fingerprinted,

45:57.588 --> 46:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their name is checked against
several databases,
and information is shared
electronically with

46:02.159 --> 46:03.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration officials.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE GILMAN, University of
Texas Law School:
There is a federal provision
that requires

46:06.430 --> 46:10.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local jurisdictions to provide
information
to the federal immigration
authorities.

46:10.701 --> 46:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the law
nationwide?

46:11.769 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE GILMAN: That's right.

46:12.803 --> 46:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And everybody is complying with
that.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's really no question about
that.

46:15.906 --> 46:19.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Denise Gilman
is an immigration
law professor at the University
of Texas in

46:19.543 --> 46:21.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Austin.

46:21.412 --> 46:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE GILMAN: The next step
then is, what
does ICE decide to do, the
federal immigration

46:24.982 --> 46:26.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
authorities?

46:26.984 --> 46:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If ICE decides to request that
the local jurisdiction
hold onto somebody for
additional time, they

46:32.790 --> 46:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
file what's called a detainer.

46:34.825 --> 46:38.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the courts and the federal
government
have recognized that that's
really just a

46:38.596 --> 46:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
request to local jurisdictions
to hold...

46:40.865 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's not a
legally binding
contract.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE GILMAN: It's not a legal
binding contract.

46:44.335 --> 46:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If immigration
officials
come to you and ask for and give
you one of

46:48.939 --> 46:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these detainers and say, we'd
like you to
hold these 10 people, why not
just hold all

46:52.943 --> 46:54.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 of them?

46:54.745 --> 46:59.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY HERNANDEZ: We are treating
immigration
like we do any other law
enforcement agency.

46:59.350 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if somebody from another
county calls
me up and says, you have
somebody in your

47:04.789 --> 47:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
custody, hold them for me, I
would ask them,
do they have a warrant?

47:08.693 --> 47:10.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if they have a warrant, we
will hold them.

47:10.795 --> 47:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why is that
warrant important?

47:12.329 --> 47:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY HERNANDEZ: Because that
warrant is based
on probable cause.

47:15.399 --> 47:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sheriff
Hernandez says she
will honor detainer requests in
cases of murder,

47:20.571 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sexual assault and human
trafficking.

47:22.873 --> 47:27.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, she is not legally
required to
hold people without warrants.

47:27.078 --> 47:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other jurisdictions have been
sued for doing
exactly that, for violating
constitutional

47:31.882 --> 47:33.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
due process.

47:33.684 --> 47:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're within the border
of the U.S.,
regardless of where you're from,
where you're

47:36.954 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
born or what your status is, the
Constitution
protects you?

47:39.990 --> 47:41.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE GILMAN: That's right.

47:41.826 --> 47:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And especially when it comes to
fundamental
constitutional principles like
liberty, that

47:45.496 --> 47:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a fundamental constitutional
principle
that is guaranteed to all
persons within the

47:50.000 --> 47:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States, regardless of
immigration status.

47:52.503 --> 47:58.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: SB-4, the law
that would
in effect outlaw sanctuary
cities statewide,

47:58.542 --> 48:02.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has left many immigrant families
like Felix
Jimenez's on edge.

48:02.680 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives with his wife, Brenda,
who is also
undocumented from Mexico, and
their daughter,

48:07.284 --> 48:11.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Evelyn, born in the United
States, and a citizen.

48:11.589 --> 48:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believes undocumented people
need to speak
out.

48:14.458 --> 48:18.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He recently attended this rally
against SB-4.

48:18.262 --> 48:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up until a few months ago, Felix
says he felt
he could call the police for
help, like when

48:22.600 --> 48:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was robbed and left bloody on
the street

48:25.136 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FELIX JIMENEZ (through
translator): I called
the police and they helped me.

48:29.573 --> 48:31.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was hospitalized.

48:31.208 --> 48:32.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had X-rays done.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was in a lot of pain, and it
still hurts.

48:35.646 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if that law existed, I
wouldn't be able
to report the crime because of
my status.

48:39.650 --> 48:45.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what do
you say to someone,
not just Sheriff Hernandez, that
having local

48:45.723 --> 48:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police be a quasi-extension of
immigration
enforcement makes their
communities less safe,

48:53.564 --> 48:54.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not more safe?

48:54.565 --> 48:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES PERRY: Yes.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think, one, that's a
dangerous logic.

48:57.568 --> 49:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're going to not adhere to
the law in
the name of applying the law.

49:02.740 --> 49:06.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, logically, that doesn't
reconcile with
me.

49:06.277 --> 49:10.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last week,
Perry's bill
passed the Texas Senate and will
be debated

49:10.681 --> 49:13.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the House.

49:14.018 --> 49:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Governor Abbott has promised to
sign it.

49:16.353 --> 49:20.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When it passes, Sheriff
Hernandez's department
could be running against the
law.

49:20.858 --> 49:25.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in the meantime, Hernandez
has been getting
what she asked for.

49:25.129 --> 49:30.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ICE officials have been
providing warrants
to hold people, and her office
is honoring

49:30.434 --> 49:31.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

49:31.769 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Austin, Texas.

49:38.242 --> 49:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series.

49:47.885 --> 49:53.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Namwali Serpell is a
Zambian-born writer and
associate professor of English
at the University

49:53.791 --> 49:55.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of California, Berkeley.

49:55.659 --> 50:01.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her first novel, "The Old
Drift," comes out
next year, but, here, she
describes her own

50:01.432 --> 50:03.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

50:03.267 --> 50:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAMWALI SERPELL, Author: There
are all these
different terms for what an
immigrant is in

50:06.370 --> 50:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America, when you have the
permission to stay.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's permanent resident,
there's resident
alien.

50:13.544 --> 50:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immigration officials are really
funny with
me, because they look at my
permanent resident

50:18.916 --> 50:20.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
card.

50:20.718 --> 50:24.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm always very anxious
about this when
I'm at the -- I mean, will they
let me back

50:24.321 --> 50:25.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in?

50:25.522 --> 50:29.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can I still be here?

50:29.360 --> 50:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I teach American literature.

50:33.397 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I start out all of my
courses by saying,
you might be wondering why a
Zambian citizen

50:39.803 --> 50:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a resident alien of the
United States
is teaching you the history of
American literature.

50:44.875 --> 50:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But who better than an outsider
to teach you
about American literature?

50:48.779 --> 50:56.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the great literature of
the U.S. is
told through the story of an
outsider, Nick

50:56.086 --> 50:59.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carraway in "Gatsby" or Humbert
Humbert in
"Lolita."

50:59.356 --> 51:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being on the outside or being an
alien is
the condition of being American.

51:03.060 --> 51:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a way to see the
country from within,
but also with a different
perspective.

51:10.034 --> 51:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember when my parents told
me we were
moving to the States.

51:13.971 --> 51:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My sisters and I were really
excited.

51:16.073 --> 51:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For me, at age 8, it was a
pretty intense
shift.

51:20.077 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had kids kind of making fun of
me, making
fun of my hair, making fun of my
accent.

51:24.848 --> 51:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember very specifically a
kid asking
me in the cafeteria in fifth
grade, what are

51:32.089 --> 51:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, not, who are you, and not
what race are
you, but what are you?

51:37.561 --> 51:40.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what she meant was, are you
black or white?

51:40.664 --> 51:43.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked my dad, my white father,
who's a psychologist.

51:43.867 --> 51:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said: "You're a citizen of
the world.

51:45.970 --> 51:47.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You are human."

51:47.204 --> 51:49.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that answer was very
unsatisfactory.

51:49.907 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was only in college that I
really started
to say I'm black, because, in
America, I'm

51:56.213 --> 51:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
black, and that's how I'm
recognized.

51:57.848 --> 52:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went back for a year to Zambia
during high
school, which was very
difficult.

52:02.052 --> 52:05.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone was like, why do you
wear your hair
curly and natural?

52:05.356 --> 52:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't like the punk rock
T-shirts I
was wearing or the big sweats
and sneaks.

52:10.494 --> 52:12.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I thought I was a skater chick.

52:12.696 --> 52:14.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People often want to say, you're
African.

52:14.932 --> 52:17.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm like, Africa is a huge
continent.

52:17.267 --> 52:18.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a country.

52:18.268 --> 52:20.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel Zambian, and then I feel
American.

52:20.237 --> 52:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are my identities, even
though, technically,
I am an alien in this country,
and, when I

52:26.910 --> 52:29.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back to Zambia, I don't
exactly fit in
there either.

52:29.613 --> 52:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realized that I could use
this to my
advantage, that you can actually
leverage

52:34.084 --> 52:41.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being an outsider in order to be
the most
unique and be the biggest voice
in the room,

52:41.325 --> 52:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and bring a new perspective to
things that
everybody else takes for
granted.

52:45.162 --> 52:51.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Namwali Serpell, and
this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on
being an alien.
