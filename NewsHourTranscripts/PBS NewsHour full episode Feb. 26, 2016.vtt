JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.607 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
wild ride on
the road to the White House.
Governor Chris

00:11.879 --> 00:16.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christie endorses Donald Trump,
after a rough
night for the Republican
front-runner on the

00:16.984 --> 00:18.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
debate stage.

00:18.585 --> 00:23.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, my report from South
Carolina, as Democrats
ready to vote tomorrow.

00:24.091 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in Iran, voters turn out
in droves for
the first major election since
the controversial

00:30.597 --> 00:32.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear deal.

00:32.666 --> 00:37.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, it's going to be a
very white
Oscars this weekend. What will
it take to

00:37.371 --> 00:40.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring more diversity to the
silver screen?

00:40.207 --> 00:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IDRIS ELBA, Actor: I realized I
could only
play so many best friends or
gang leaders.

00:45.779 --> 00:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right? I knew that I wasn't
going to land
a leading role. I knew there
wasn't enough

00:50.417 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imagination, not yet, for the
industry to
be seeing me as a lead.

00:55.355 --> 01:00.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and "The National Review"'s
Ramesh Ponnuru

01:00.127 --> 01:03.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are here to analyze the week's
news.

01:03.397 --> 01:10.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.771 --> 01:13.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.640 --> 01:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
presidential
race took another unexpected
plot twist today,

01:24.484 --> 01:29.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Donald Trump collecting a
major endorsement
from a former rival. It came
just a few days

01:29.790 --> 01:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before the all-important Super
Tuesday contests.

01:32.459 --> 01:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), New
Jersey: I am
proud to be here to endorse
Donald Trump for

01:36.496 --> 01:38.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of the United States.

01:38.432 --> 01:43.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a single
stroke, New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie put
Donald Trump back

01:43.170 --> 01:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the offensive after his
rivals scored points
in last night's debate.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: We don't
need another
Washington politician in the
White House,

01:51.211 --> 01:51.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do we?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

01:53.613 --> 01:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: Do we need
a first-term
United States senator in the
White House?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

01:58.785 --> 02:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: We need a
first-class
president, and we're going to
have it in Donald

02:01.521 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:04.157 --> 02:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
front-runner
then took his turn, blasting
both of the senators

02:08.895 --> 02:11.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still in the race, first Marco
Rubio.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Let's talk about our lightweight
senator from

02:14.601 --> 02:17.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida who's losing big in the
polls.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:18.472 --> 02:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then Ted Cruz
of Texas.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know, I have
had a lot of
difficulties with Ted, because
he does lies.

02:22.843 --> 02:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I have dealt with much
tougher.
A guy like Rubio is a baby, but
a guy like

02:27.647 --> 02:29.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ted is tougher.

02:29.583 --> 02:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rubio had spent
much of his
morning rally in Dallas arguing
that billionaire

02:34.621 --> 02:37.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is deceiving working-class
voters.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
You all have friends who are
thinking about

02:39.626 --> 02:42.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting for Donald Trump. Friends
do not let
friends vote for con artists.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:44.765 --> 02:47.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: He's going to
Americans
that are struggling, Americans
that are hurting,

02:47.701 --> 02:53.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he's implying, "I'm fighting
for you because
I'm a tough guy." A tough guy?
This guy inherited

02:53.707 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$200 million. He's never faced
any struggle.

02:57.811 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in Nashville,
Tennessee,
Cruz questioned Trump's
conservative credentials.

03:03.050 --> 03:06.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump said: I can be a
totally different

03:06.820 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person after I'm elected. I can
be -- this
is Donald speaking -- the most
politically

03:11.458 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
correct person on earth.

03:13.326 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me tell you something, Sean.
The day after
I'm elected president, I'm the
exact same

03:17.264 --> 03:18.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person that I am today.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:20.700 --> 03:24.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Those were
extensions of the
charges and countercharges that
lit up last

03:25.005 --> 03:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night's Houston debate, with
Rubio and Cruz
trying to slow Trump's momentum,
first on

03:31.244 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: You're the
only person on
this stage that has ever been
fined for hiring

03:35.048 --> 03:37.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to work on your projects
illegally.
You hired some workers from
Poland

03:37.684 --> 03:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, no, I'm the
only one on
the stage that's hired people.
You haven't

03:40.821 --> 03:41.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hired anybody.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:42.589 --> 03:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: In fact, some
of the people...

03:44.157 --> 03:46.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:46.126 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, I
have hired
-- and by the way, I have hired
tens of thousands

03:48.628 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people over at my job. You've
hired nobody.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Yes, you've
hired a thousand
from another country...

03:53.467 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You've had nothing
but problems
with your credit cards, et
cetera. So don't

03:54.267 --> 03:56.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tell me about that.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Let me just
say -- let me
finish the statement. This is
important.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You haven't hired
one person,
you liar.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: He hired
workers from Poland.
And he had to pay a million
dollars or so

04:02.542 --> 04:03.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a judgment from...

04:03.877 --> 04:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That's wrong.
That's wrong.
Totally wrong.

04:05.846 --> 04:10.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cruz also jumped
in, criticizing
Trump for donating to senators
known as the

04:10.650 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Gang of Eight, who led an
immigration reform
effort.

04:13.887 --> 04:17.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Donald funded the
Gang of Eight.
If you look at the eight members
of the Gang

04:18.058 --> 04:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Eight, Donald gave over
$50,000 to three
Democrats and two Republicans.
And when you're

04:24.097 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding open border politicians,
you shouldn't
be surprised when they fight for
open borders.

04:29.336 --> 04:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have had an
amazing relationship
with politicians -- with
politicians both

04:35.408 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrat, Republican, because I
was a businessman.

04:38.111 --> 04:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have one Republican
senator, not
one. You don't have the
endorsement of one

04:44.151 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senator, and you work
with these
people. You should be ashamed of
yourself.

04:48.188 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the end, Trump
waved away
both rivals, calling Rubio a
choke artist

04:54.161 --> 04:56.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Cruz a liar.

04:56.630 --> 05:02.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But despite the strident words
from all sides,
the front-runner insisted he can
expand and

05:02.736 --> 05:04.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unify the party.

05:04.738 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will do very
well with Hispanics.
But I'm telling you also, I'm
bringing people,

05:08.975 --> 05:13.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats over, and I'm bringing
independents
over, and we're building a much
bigger, much

05:13.480 --> 05:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stronger Republican Party.

05:15.448 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He gets another
chance to prove
that Super Tuesday night, with
more than 600

05:21.555 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delegates up for grabs.

05:23.490 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, Democrats in South
Carolina will
have their say in a primary
tomorrow. We will

05:29.462 --> 05:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a close look at a vital
voting bloc there
after the news summary.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The small town of Hesston,
Kansas, is now
the latest left to cope with a
shooting rampage.

05:39.406 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities today identified
Cedric Ford as
the gunman who yesterday shot
three people

05:44.778 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to death and wounded 15. They
said he'd just
been ordered to stay away from
someone who

05:50.417 --> 05:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sought legal protection against
him.

05:53.220 --> 05:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within 90 minutes of that order,
Ford opened
fire on random vehicles, stormed
into a lawn

05:59.025 --> 06:04.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mower parts factory, where he
was employed,
and gunned down co-workers. It
ended when

06:04.698 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was killed by police.

06:06.633 --> 06:11.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
T. WALTON, Harvey County
Sheriff: That particular
officer is a hero out of all
this. Understand,

06:11.871 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's probably 200 or 300 more
people in
that building while this is
going on. This

06:18.979 --> 06:23.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
man wasn't going to stop
shooting. The only
reason he stopped shooting was
because that

06:23.783 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officer stopped the shooter.

06:25.619 --> 06:30.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Kansas
incident came less
than a week after an Uber driver
killed six

06:30.490 --> 06:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in a mass shooting in
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

06:34.327 --> 06:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy new airstrikes blasted
rebel targets
in Syria today in the run-up to
a scheduled

06:39.699 --> 06:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire. Activists said
Russian planes
carried out the attacks. A
barrage of explosions

06:45.739 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cracked the skies over suburbs
of Damascus.
Monitoring groups said the area
was hit 40

06:52.045 --> 06:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times and dozens more struck
north of Aleppo.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the onslaught, Russian
President Vladimir
Putin said in Moscow that his
government is

07:00.987 --> 07:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committed to enforcing the truce
deal.

07:03.890 --> 07:08.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): From midnight
Damascus time on

07:08.828 --> 07:14.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
February 27, Syrian forces,
Russian forces
and the American-led coalition
will halt all

07:14.501 --> 07:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military actions against the
groups that have
declared their readiness to
cease fire. Military

07:19.539 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions against them will not be
conducted.

07:21.441 --> 07:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group and
the Nusra Front, linked to
al-Qaida, are not

07:26.980 --> 07:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties to the cease-fire. But a
special U.N.
envoy said today that if the
truce largely

07:32.485 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holds, peace talks will resume
on March 7.

07:36.389 --> 07:42.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This was Election Day in
Ireland, and anti-austerity
parties hoped to gain ground.
Prime Minister

07:42.295 --> 07:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enda Kenny and his center-right
party are
seeking a second five-year term.
But there

07:47.867 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are signs that his coalition may
lose its
majority, leaving a hung
Parliament. Ballot-counting

07:54.607 --> 07:56.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will begin Saturday.

07:56.543 --> 08:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dow Chemical will pay $835
million to settle
a long-running lawsuit, now that
the Supreme

08:03.550 --> 08:08.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court has lost its conservative
majority.
The company said today the death
of Supreme

08:08.221 --> 08:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court Justice Antonin Scalia
makes it less
certain of winning class-action
cases. A lower

08:14.361 --> 08:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court convicted Dow of fixing
prices for polyurethane,
a widely used industrial
chemical.

08:21.768 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World soccer's governing body,
FIFA, has elected
a new leader to lead it out of
scandal. A

08:27.407 --> 08:33.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Swiss candidate, Gianni
Infantino, was tapped
by a majority today in a vote in
Zurich. The

08:33.413 --> 08:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delegates also adopted reforms
to make FIFA
more accountable.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Infantino said he wants to start
anew.

08:40.353 --> 08:45.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GIANNI INFANTINO, FIFA
President: We will
restore the image of FIFA, and
the respect

08:45.125 --> 08:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of FIFA, and everyone in the
world will applaud
us and will applaud all of you
for what we

08:50.196 --> 08:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will do in FIFA in the future.
We have to
be proud of FIFA, and everyone
has to be proud

08:56.636 --> 08:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of FIFA and they have to be
proud of what
we will do together.

08:58.905 --> 09:04.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new president
replaces
Sepp Blatter, also Swiss, who
resigned amid

09:04.377 --> 09:09.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges of massive corruption.
Dozens of soccer
officials around the world have
been indicted,

09:09.349 --> 09:16.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and FIFA is reviewing how Russia
and Qatar
won the right to host the next
two World Cups.

09:16.256 --> 09:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations is out with a
warning that
two-fifths of bees, butterflies,
and related

09:22.328 --> 09:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pollinating species are heading
toward extinction.
The warning follows more than
two years of

09:27.634 --> 09:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research around the globe. It
cites a range
of factors, ranging from
pesticide use to

09:33.306 --> 09:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate change to habitat loss.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street finished this Friday
without much
momentum. The Dow Jones
industrial average

09:40.980 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost 57 points to close just
below 16640.
The Nasdaq rose eight points,
and the S&amp;P

09:49.088 --> 09:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
500 slipped three. But for the
week, all three
indexes were about 1.5 percent
higher.

09:56.162 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a 23-year-old Hawaiian man
is $75,000
richer after winning a rare
giant wave surfing

10:03.670 --> 10:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contest in Hawaii. John John
Florence was
one of 29 brave souls tackling
the massive

10:10.910 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waves Thursday off Oahu. The
contest is held
only rarely, when waves reach 40
feet in height.

10:18.318 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yesterday, some of them topped
60 feet.

10:22.555 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the crucial
African-American vote in the
Democratic election;

10:28.394 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and Ramesh Ponnuru
give their
take on today's surprise
endorsement of Donald

10:32.932 --> 10:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump; Iran's elections, a key
test for the
moderates in the wake of the
nuclear deal;

10:38.972 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
solutions for the Oscars'
diversity problem;
plus, a presidential serenade.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now to South Carolina.

10:58.224 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump scored a commanding
win there
last weekend on the Republican
side. Tomorrow,

11:03.897 --> 11:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats head to the polls.

11:05.732 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I just got back from the
Palmetto State, where
victory hinges on a key group of
voters.

11:11.304 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders, South
Carolina represents not only the
largest electorate

11:18.244 --> 11:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have faced so far this
year, but the
first big test of popularity
among a crucial

11:23.550 --> 11:25.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democratic voting bloc.

11:25.251 --> 11:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We have got somebody that
definitely
will stand with us.

11:29.022 --> 11:34.360 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
African-Americans, in the last
election, they accounted for 55
percent of

11:34.460 --> 11:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the primary vote here. It's no
coincidence
both candidates have been
targeting their

11:39.966 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
messages almost exclusively at
that audience.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Something's wrong when
African-Americans are

11:46.573 --> 11:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three times as likely to be
denied a mortgage
as white people are.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
When African-American youth
unemployment is

11:54.714 --> 11:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
51 percent, you know what? We're
going to
create jobs and educational
opportunities

11:59.619 --> 12:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for our kids, not more jails.

12:01.654 --> 12:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has a
long connection
with this state, dating back
when she was

12:06.693 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a young law student, working on
juvenile justice
issues, and continuing through
her husband's

12:13.132 --> 12:14.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The mayor of the capital city,
Columbia, Stephen
Benjamin..

12:16.002 --> 12:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILDREN: We present to you the
45th president
of the United States.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:22.141 --> 12:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... says many
African-Americans
think of the Clintons as
champions of the

12:27.880 --> 12:29.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disenfranchised.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BENJAMIN, Mayor of
Columbia, South
Carolina: Fighting for criminal
justice reform,

12:31.918 --> 12:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting for education, fighting
for health
care.

12:35.888 --> 12:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That affection
has given Clinton
a solid base in this state,
particularly among

12:41.761 --> 12:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
older African-American women,
the voting bloc
that turned out at the highest
rate of any

12:48.534 --> 12:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group in 2012, and which is
expected to do
so again this year.

12:52.739 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of the reasons why
women were prominently
featured at nearly every Clinton
event in

12:59.278 --> 13:01.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
South Carolina this week.

13:01.314 --> 13:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Representative Chandra
Dillard was in
the audience when Clinton spoke
to her black

13:05.885 --> 13:07.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sorority group.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDRA DILLARD (D), South
Carolina State
Representative: I see her as
someone being

13:09.555 --> 13:15.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to bring people together,
which will
enhance policy-making,
hopefully, with our

13:16.062 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress, because Secretary
Clinton has been
in that position to bring
parties together

13:23.569 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work on issues. She's done
it. She can
do it again.

13:27.740 --> 13:32.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dillard's
colleague, state
Representative Justin Bamberg,
acknowledges

13:32.845 --> 13:38.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton has a built-in
advantage, but he hopes
that when people listen to
Sanders' message,

13:38.151 --> 13:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they will do as he did and
switch their support.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUSTIN BAMBERG (D), South
Carolina State Representative:
The younger folks aren't
thinking about history

13:43.923 --> 13:49.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as much. They're thinking
forward. They're
looking at the fact that, man,
I'm in my early

13:49.729 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
20s, and when I graduate
college, I'm going
to owe more in student loan debt
than I would

13:54.534 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if I had not gone to college and
just went
and bought a house.

13:58.171 --> 14:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bamberg says
Sanders' promise
of free college tuition and a
plan to narrow

14:03.276 --> 14:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the income inequality gap has
helped him gain
some traction in the state, as
has his tough

14:14.120 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stance on Wall Street donors.

14:15.955 --> 14:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN BAMBERG: I don't think he
will waver
to the special interest or those
large groups

14:21.594 --> 14:29.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the most money that
oftentimes can cause
decisions to be made that aren't
in the people's

14:29.102 --> 14:30.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best interest.

14:31.037 --> 14:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders supporter
Gloria Bromell
Tinubu is even more pointed in
her criticism

14:36.309 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Clintons' relationship
with big money.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA BROMELL TINUBU, Sanders
Supporter:
It's clear that they were are
the leaders

14:41.614 --> 14:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and are the leaders of what is
called the
new Democrats, which is pro-big
business,

14:47.053 --> 14:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pro-big money, pro-war, right,
anti-welfare,
anti-government that will
support poor people,

14:54.861 --> 14:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but always for a government that
will support
rich.

14:58.164 --> 15:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: University of
South Carolina
political scientist Todd Shaw
says, while

15:03.002 --> 15:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders still lags in the polls
here -- most
show him more than 20 points
behind Clinton

15:09.876 --> 15:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- his predominantly young
followers seem
to be more enthusiastic.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD SHAW, University of South
Carolina: Sanders
supporters say that he has the
vision thing

15:16.716 --> 15:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. He's visionary. Yes, these
are bold
and idealistic questions, but
they should

15:21.821 --> 15:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be questions that we're raising.
And he may
be -- he's certainly appealing
to a pent-up

15:27.460 --> 15:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frustration about what hasn't
occurred.

15:29.862 --> 15:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shaw says Clinton
has been
wise to tie herself closely to
President Obama,

15:36.335 --> 15:40.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who's enormously popular among
black Democrats
here.

15:40.406 --> 15:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD SHAW: It's a pretty smart
move, because,
of course, she can make that
claim, having

15:45.011 --> 15:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been the secretary -- his former
secretary
of state, that she can say,
well, he -- and

15:52.218 --> 15:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she does say, in effect, it was
Hillarycare
before it was Obamacare, but I
give him credit

15:56.989 --> 16:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he carried it out. And now
here's where
I'm going to now carry this
football forward.

16:02.161 --> 16:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twenty-year-old
Jada Williams
says that's why she's
volunteering for Clinton,

16:08.301 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and not Sanders.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JADA WILLIAMS, Clinton
Supporter: I think
that we don't need a big
revolution. I don't

16:14.073 --> 16:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we need to make America
great again.
I feel like we're doing well.
And Hillary

16:18.911 --> 16:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the person who is going to
make us continue
to do well and put us towards
what people

16:24.417 --> 16:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feel like is the American dream.

16:26.319 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other factor
at play here
and in next week's Super Tuesday
contests

16:31.924 --> 16:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a focus on racial injustice.

16:34.861 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an issue keenly felt in a
state where
a white gunman killed nine black
people worshiping

16:41.167 --> 16:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in church, as well as several
highly publicized
cases of alleged police
misconduct.

16:46.906 --> 16:54.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This past week, Clinton
campaigned alongside
the mothers of victims of
violence, including

16:54.180 --> 16:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sybrina Fulton, the mother of
Trayvon Martin.

16:56.015 --> 17:00.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SYBRINA FULTON, Mother of
Trayvon Martin:
And we have an opportunity to
have someone

17:00.286 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's going to stand up for us
as African-Americans,
for us as women. I say my vote
goes to Hillary

17:07.860 --> 17:08.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:10.396 --> 17:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in a TV ad
narrated by
actor Morgan Freeman, Clinton
tackles the

17:14.233 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
issue head on.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORGAN FREEMAN, Actor: She says

want to help
the African-Americans here in
this community.

17:31.417 --> 17:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want everyone to come together
because we
do have a problem here and it
needs to be

17:36.389 --> 17:38.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
addressed.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders tackles
racial injustice
in part by linking it to his
central rallying

17:42.094 --> 17:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cry of economic inequality.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

nothing we cannot
accomplish.

SPIKE LEE, Director: Ninety-nine
percent of
Americans were hurt by the great
recession

17:55.374 --> 18:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 2008 and many are still
recovering, and
that's why I am officially
endorsing my brother

18:00.446 --> 18:02.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bernie Sanders.

18:02.348 --> 18:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Sanders also
stresses his
lifelong activism for civil
rights, going

18:06.519 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to the 1960s.

18:08.487 --> 18:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: He was there when Dr.
King marched
on Washington, unafraid to
challenge the status

18:12.692 --> 18:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quo to end racial profiling,
take on police
misconduct, and take down a
system that profits

18:17.964 --> 18:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from mass imprisonment.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: There is no
president
who will fight harder to end

consistently fought
for rights for all people,
equality and justice.

18:33.546 --> 18:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just a passing
thing with him.
It's something that he's being
doing for close

18:40.486 --> 18:42.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 50 years.

18:42.355 --> 18:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders' camp
acknowledges
she's ahead. Their goal is to
hold down the

18:47.960 --> 18:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size of her margin here, as they
to try to
pick off some of the
delegate-rich Super Tuesday

18:53.733 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

18:55.701 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with African-Americans
making up a powerful
portion of many states coming
up, Clinton's

19:01.841 --> 19:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage with blacks in South
Carolina amounts
to a serious and enduring
challenge for him.

19:10.683 --> 19:15.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that brings us to Shields
and Ponnuru.
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and

19:15.254 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ramesh Ponnuru of "The National
Review."

19:18.824 --> 19:19.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, welcome, gentlemen.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU, Senior Editor,
"The National
Review": Thank you.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, hold that
thought about
the Democrats and about South
Carolina. I

19:24.130 --> 19:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to ask you about that.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, I have to start with
the Donald
Trump endorsement by Chris
Christie today.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you make of this, the
timing of it,
the fact of it?

19:34.006 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, the old line
of Speaker
Tip O'Neill, who said all
politics is local,

19:39.779 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all politics is personal.

19:42.381 --> 19:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Christie, who was going to
be the "tell
it like it is" candidate in
2016, was eclipsed

19:48.320 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totally by Donald Trump, and
blames his defeat,
where he concentrated all his
effort, energy,

19:53.793 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention and resources in New
Hampshire,
where he finished sixth, he
blames it on Marco

19:58.964 --> 20:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio's super PAC, which ran a
negative ad
on Christie as Christie was just
starting

20:05.071 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get some traction in that
state which highlighted
Chris Christie's physical
embrace of the president

20:11.444 --> 20:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States, Barack
Obama, who was
bringing aid to the devastated
state of New

20:15.181 --> 20:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jersey after Hurricane Sandy,
just prior to
the election of 2012, and
mentioned the nine

20:22.054 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
credit lowering rating -- the
times that the
state's credit rating had been
lowered in

20:27.526 --> 20:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Chris Christie's administration.

20:31.030 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he -- it was really quite
personal why
he endorsed Donald Trump. He
said he's known

20:35.968 --> 20:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him and all the rest of it. I
think that's
essentially the reason.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
payback.

20:40.139 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, Christie
spoke about
Rubio negatively almost as much
as he spoke

20:43.542 --> 20:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positively about Donald Trump
today.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's exactly
right.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I think that the
endorsement
helps Chris -- excuse me --
helps Trump in

20:48.380 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two ways. It also helps
Christie.

20:50.216 --> 20:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it helps Trump in two ways.
One is, it
signals that it's OK for elected
Republican

20:54.186 --> 20:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials to support him. And,
in fact, right
after he did, Maine's Governor
Paul LePage,

20:58.958 --> 21:01.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had endorsed Christie, went
ahead and
endorsed Trump too.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second thing it does is,
it takes
the coverage away from questions
about his

21:06.465 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
university defrauding people,
away from his
hiring illegal immigrants, and
puts it onto

21:11.504 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his momentum, which is where he
needs it to
be.

21:13.639 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is all
about last night's
debate, which was a remarkable
spectacle,

21:19.478 --> 21:21.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mark Shields.

21:21.347 --> 21:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know that we have seen
anything -- I
guess we haven't seen anything
like it in

21:24.316 --> 21:24.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this cycle.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

21:26.685 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
account for Rubio
and Cruz finally coming out and
going after

21:30.556 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

21:31.323 --> 21:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Desperation.

21:33.692 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump now stands on the
cusp of Super
Tuesday. Just a little check of
history, this

21:42.067 --> 21:49.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in -- the Southeastern
Conference, SEC primaries,
these are states that include
Alabama, Arkansas,

21:49.108 --> 21:50.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Georgia, Oklahoma.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Texas.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Oklahoma and
Tennessee.

21:55.014 --> 22:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these states were all won by
the previous
winners of the Iowa caucus, Mike
Huckabee

22:00.586 --> 22:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Rick Santorum, by one or both
of them.
They're states with large
evangelical populations.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There, cultural and religious
candidates expect
to do well.

22:09.461 --> 22:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We recall that this was going to
be where
Ted Cruz of Texas ran up the
score.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And what do we
find out is going
on prior to the debate last
night? That, in

22:19.271 --> 22:25.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all these states, Donald Trump,
the most aggressively
secular candidate running in
either party,

22:25.911 --> 22:29.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is, in fact, leading.

22:29.448 --> 22:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there had to be a sense of
stopping him.
The biggest winner of the night,
in my judgment,

22:34.687 --> 22:39.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were former President George
H.W. Bush and
first lady Barbara Bush, who
honored their

22:40.092 --> 22:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obligation to show up in their
hometown at
a time when they accepted
expecting that their

22:45.297 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
son Jeb would be one of the main
competitors,
and they still graciously showed
up. And they

22:49.835 --> 22:51.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just deserve...
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw them
seated in the back
of the room.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They just deserve,
I think,
our admiration and respect.

22:55.074 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I just thought it was
remarkable. I will
just close by quickly saying
Marco Rubio showed

23:01.447 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that had been missing
this entire
campaign, humor. There had been
no humor.

23:05.718 --> 23:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had been a humorless campaign
in both sides.
And I thought he really did it
very well,

23:11.023 --> 23:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a natural way, comfortable in
his own skin,
and really put Donald Trump
right back on

23:16.228 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his heels.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it certainly
was at the
expense of Donald Trump.

23:20.399 --> 23:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did Rubio damage Donald Trump
last night with
some of these very, very tough
comments, Ramesh,

23:26.939 --> 23:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fact that he inherited
his money,
what he did with so-called Trump
University

23:32.144 --> 23:33.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and on and on?

23:33.979 --> 23:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Maybe even more
surprising
than how well Donald Trump has
been doing

23:38.717 --> 23:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Republican primaries has
been that
he has faced almost no real
resistance in

23:43.322 --> 23:45.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the debates or in the ad war so
far.

23:46.091 --> 23:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that ended last night, and I
thought Senator
Rubio did do a good job, and
Senator Cruz

23:50.729 --> 23:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did as well to a lesser extent,
in pointing
out all of the many
vulnerabilities that Trump

23:56.235 --> 24:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has on the questions of, does he
really tell
it like it is? Is he really on
your side?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question, of course, is, is
it too late?

24:04.076 --> 24:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is it? What
do you think?

24:07.513 --> 24:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, it's the
-- by drowning
it out with the Christie
endorsement, that,

24:13.085 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, shows you that the
Trump people thought
that it was a potential problem,
because it's

24:19.224 --> 24:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not as though Christie makes
sense in terms
of swaying voters in Alabama,
Tennessee and

24:24.697 --> 24:25.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Texas.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

24:27.166 --> 24:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: That is because
he is at risk
of suffering in the polls
everywhere because

24:31.170 --> 24:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this onslaught of attacks.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
they did this
to move the bad performance or
not the strongest

24:36.608 --> 24:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
performance in the debate.

24:38.010 --> 24:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Yes, I think the
timing of
it makes the most sense.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:40.245 --> 24:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think it
was trying
to change the story, no question
about it.

24:42.181 --> 24:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what was interesting, Judy,
was that Marco
Rubio, who had been terminally
nervous the

24:46.285 --> 24:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last time we had seen him in New
Hampshire,
not South Carolina, but New
Hampshire, in

24:50.789 --> 24:56.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
suffering from chronic
thirstiness and all
the rest of it in that debate
there, came

24:56.295 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on last night, and what he did
was he out-Trumped
Trump.

25:00.299 --> 25:07.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He bullied the bully. He used
Trump's tactics,
got right up in his face, used
mocking humor,

25:07.339 --> 25:13.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't let him finish a
sentence, and really
took Trump's game away from
Trump, and, I

25:13.379 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, changed himself in the
process.

25:15.614 --> 25:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does show you Trump's
game plan is
seen by even his adversaries as
the winning

25:22.421 --> 25:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
game plan, that is, the New York
values, in
your face. Same to you.

25:26.892 --> 25:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So does it help?
Mark, does
it help Marco Rubio? Does it
hurt Donald Trump?

25:32.498 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it too late?

25:34.433 --> 25:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We will find out.
We will find
out, certainly, the early
indication on that,

25:37.136 --> 25:38.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Tuesday, Judy.

25:38.971 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I just think you had -- your
perception
of Marco Rubio had to change. I
think your

25:43.942 --> 25:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perception of Donald Trump had
to change last
night. I mean, this was Donald
Trump on the

25:49.047 --> 25:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defensive saying, when he was
asked about
the Trump University, I have won
most of those

25:53.552 --> 25:55.354 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lawsuits.

25:55.454 --> 26:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that hardly sounds like
somebody who's
founding Amherst or Wesleyan or
Notre Dame,

26:02.094 --> 26:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying with pride. So, I just --
I thought
he was very much on the
defensive.

26:06.965 --> 26:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: When is the last
time you
heard a presidential candidate
boast about

26:10.102 --> 26:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being audited, as though that
were a defense
of...

26:12.738 --> 26:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why he's not
putting his
tax returns out.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Right. Exactly.

26:17.342 --> 26:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was important for Rubio not
to just land
a punch on Trump in order to
take him down.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was also to address this
lingering concern
that Republicans have that maybe
he's not

26:25.951 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tough enough.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: So, I do think
it doesn't
just hurt Trump, but also helps
Rubio.

26:30.122 --> 26:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
Ted Cruz, though, because this
is the one

26:34.359 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other Republican besides Donald
Trump who
has won a contest.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

26:39.832 --> 26:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He won the Iowa
caucuses. Marco
Rubio hasn't won anything yet.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, everybody's
saying Cruz
has to win his home state of
Texas. Do you

26:48.841 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree with that?

26:49.408 --> 26:50.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What else does he
need to do
right now?

26:52.211 --> 26:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He has to win.
Well, I think
he has to win another state.

26:55.180 --> 26:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're right about Marco
Rubio. Marco
Rubio has yet to win anywhere.
And he's, according

26:59.885 --> 27:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to polls, trailing in his home
state, where
there have been already been, I
found out

27:05.057 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, 200,000 early ballots
cast. And it's
hard to believe...

27:08.560 --> 27:09.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Texas.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And in Florida.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, in Florida.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Already in
Florida, which is
not until the 15th.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the speculation is that a
pretty sizable
proportion of those are Trump
votes at this

27:17.836 --> 27:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point. So, Donald Trump has
changed the Republican
electorate. He's increased it.
He's increased

27:24.176 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it dramatically. He's brought
people in.

27:26.578 --> 27:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Marco Rubio has to win
somewhere. He
certainly has to win in Florida,
but -- his

27:32.551 --> 27:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home state. And I just think the
same thing
is true for John Kasich in his
home state.

27:37.723 --> 27:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's not going to win his
home state, I
think he will get out before
losing his home

27:41.660 --> 27:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state, which Rick Santorum, you
will recall,
did in 2012 before the
Pennsylvania primary,

27:46.665 --> 27:49.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which is -- it's just an
embarrassment to
lose your home state.

27:49.167 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ramesh, where do
you see the
path for Cruz? And what about
John Kasich?

27:53.839 --> 27:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, because of
the calendar,
Senator Cruz faces this home
state test before

27:59.044 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kasich and Rubio do.

28:01.547 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if he loses Texas on
Tuesday, then I think
that it becomes very hard for
him to stay

28:07.853 --> 28:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the race. He was supposed to
do well in
a lot of states on Tuesday...

28:12.291 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RAMESH PONNURU: ... but
especially Texas would
be a problem.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stakes aren't quite as high
for Rubio,
but let's not forget, we're not
just talking

28:18.564 --> 28:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about momentum at this point.
We're talking
about actual delegates. And
people do start

28:23.502 --> 28:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be -- need to start winning
some of these
delegates.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:27.639 --> 28:31.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: If he wins
Massachusetts and
Alabama, he being Trump, that is
quite an

28:31.276 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
achievement.

28:33.278 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's running ahead in both
those states.
Can you imagine two states more
demographically

28:36.248 --> 28:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ideologically different,
even to Republicans.
But, I mean, so he's showing
strength at this

28:42.087 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point that the others have to
disprove.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about
the Democrats.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just heard our report from
South Carolina
last night.

28:49.895 --> 28:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I did. Excellent
report.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

28:52.497 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, my question is, where
does the
Democratic race stand? Hillary
Clinton right

28:55.500 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now way ahead in the polls in
South Carolina.
Bernie Sanders' people
themselves don't expect

29:01.607 --> 29:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to win. They're focusing on
Super Tuesday.
What is -- who needs to do what
at this point?

29:07.746 --> 29:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, she needs a
convincing
victory, but she also more than
anything else

29:11.617 --> 29:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has to demonstrate enthusiasm,
some passion
on the part of voters.

29:16.021 --> 29:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic turnout has been
down, in spite
of the excitement generated by
Bernie Sanders

29:21.259 --> 29:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among younger voters, especially
in New Hampshire
and Iowa. But it's been down.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Compared to the
Republicans.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Compared to 2008,
and the Republican
is up.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh.

29:32.137 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And that is an
early indicator
of where both parties are in any
given presidential

29:36.041 --> 29:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, when there is that kind of
intensity
and passion on one side and the
absence of

29:39.745 --> 29:41.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

29:41.647 --> 29:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think Senator -- Secretary
Clinton has
to demonstrate that she is able
to generate

29:45.217 --> 29:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enthusiasm, intensity, passion.
I think she
has to win decisively there, no
more four-point,

29:53.191 --> 29:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
five-point victories, a la
Nevada.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And cutting right
into Super
Tuesday, which is just a few
days away.

30:00.098 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. That's right.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ramesh, how do
you see the
Democratic -- the challenge both
that Secretary

30:04.569 --> 30:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton and Senator Sanders
face?

30:06.505 --> 30:10.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, the
problem for Senator
Sanders is not just that he is
so far behind

30:10.242 --> 30:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in South Carolina. It's that he
is behind
because he's not doing well with
African-Americans.

30:16.014 --> 30:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is a sign of his great
weakness in
these primary contests. You
can't win the

30:21.019 --> 30:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic nomination if you
can't get a lot
of African-American votes.

30:25.157 --> 30:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem for Hillary Clinton
is that there's
no putting Senator Sanders away.
That is,

30:30.362 --> 30:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he got into the race as
a cause candidate,
as somebody who wanted to make a
point. And

30:36.501 --> 30:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then it became possible for him
maybe to win.
If it stops being possible for
him to win,

30:41.406 --> 30:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his original rationale doesn't
disappear,
and there is no reason for him
to drop out

30:44.910 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the race. He just stays in
there and makes
his point.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not
saying we're
at that point now, are you?

30:49.581 --> 30:54.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I'm not. but I'm
saying that
even if Clinton does very well
in South Carolina,

30:54.653 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it just causes him to go back to
protest mode.

30:57.689 --> 31:02.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't mean that he's -- I
think there
is no reason for him to drop out
because he's

31:02.527 --> 31:06.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
angling for a Cabinet
appointment in the Clinton
administration, the way a normal
primary candidate

31:06.498 --> 31:07.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
would be.

31:07.966 --> 31:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Two quick points
to support
Ramesh's central point.

31:10.469 --> 31:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First is that Democrats have
proportional
representation. So, Bernie
Sanders, with 40

31:16.908 --> 31:22.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of the delegates at the
Democratic
Convention, and if that's the
case in Philadelphia,

31:22.681 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what does he want? Does he want
a platform?
Does he want Hillary Clinton...

31:25.784 --> 31:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because you
expect him to win
some contests.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, I expect him
to win.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More contests.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Even if it goes
the best way
for Clinton from this point
forward, yes,

31:32.824 --> 31:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think he will win states
and he will
surprise us.

31:35.827 --> 31:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I say that because this
gives him enormous
leverage, and he does -- and the
other -- second

31:42.801 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing is, you already see Senate
candidates,
Democratic Senate candidates
echoing and mimicking

31:49.074 --> 31:54.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his words and his issues,
talking about the
economy being rigged in the very
language

31:54.646 --> 31:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Bernie Sanders has used.

31:56.481 --> 32:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's already having an impact
and an influence
far beyond what anybody
expected, perhaps

32:02.387 --> 32:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even himself, when this began.

32:04.256 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coming out of her
Nevada win
last weekend, Ramesh, Bernie
Sanders says

32:08.360 --> 32:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
words to the effect, Hillary
Clinton is already
adopting some of what we
believe, so that's

32:13.498 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already taking place.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: That's right.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's talked about having a
public option
in health care again. And that
is, I think,

32:19.471 --> 32:21.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Sanders influence.

32:21.273 --> 32:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ramesh Ponnuru,
Mark Shields,
it couldn't get any more
exciting than it

32:25.510 --> 32:29.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is right now. Thank you both.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Thanks for
having me.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

32:38.657 --> 32:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An election was
also center
stage in Iran today. Voters
streamed to the

32:44.362 --> 32:49.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polls in a high-stakes contest
with far-reaching
consequences.

32:49.134 --> 32:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turnout was so heavy that voting
was extended
more than five hours past the
original closing

32:54.840 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's an
election that could
shape Iran for years to come.
Millions of

33:01.746 --> 33:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people crowded into some 53,000
polling stations.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): One
shouldn't
be indifferent. I vote for the
future of our

33:09.454 --> 33:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country and for a higher level
of our welfare.

33:11.690 --> 33:17.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: They're
deciding who wins
the 290 seats in Parliament,
plus the 88 positions

33:17.696 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Assembly of Experts, a
group of clerics
that chooses the country's
supreme leader.

33:23.301 --> 33:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were multiple appeals
today to get out
the vote. The current supreme
leader, 76-year-old

33:28.740 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been
in power
since 1989, and represents
conservative hard-liners.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, Supreme
Leader of
Iran (through translator): We
have enemies

33:36.948 --> 33:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are eying us greedily.
Turnout in the
elections should be as such that
our enemy

33:41.486 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be disappointed and will
lose hope. People
should be observant and vote
with open eyes.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A vetting
panel, appointed
partly by Khamenei, had blocked
thousands

33:51.429 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reformist candidates from
running for Parliament,
and about 80 percent of those
running for

33:56.401 --> 33:58.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Assembly of Experts.

33:58.370 --> 34:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the more-moderate forces,
led by President
Hassan Rouhani, hoped to chip
away at hard-line

34:03.875 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dominance.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): Today, our friends
and enemies

34:07.679 --> 34:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from around the world are gazing
at Islamic
Iran. I have no doubt that the
Iranian nation,

34:12.617 --> 34:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like always, will create another
epic turnout
at this very sensitive juncture
in time.

34:17.756 --> 34:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The vote is,
to some degree,
a referendum on Rouhani's
promises of greater

34:22.994 --> 34:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
freedoms and economic reform.

34:26.197 --> 34:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also the first election
since the nuclear
deal with the U.S. and other
world powers

34:30.702 --> 34:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signed last summer. Under the
agreement, Iran
is curbing its nuclear program,
in exchange

34:35.907 --> 34:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for international sanctions
relief.

34:38.743 --> 34:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, the U.N.'s nuclear
watchdog found
Tehran is mostly complying with
the deal so

34:43.848 --> 34:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far. The election outcome is
also being closely
watched in Washington. Full
election returns

34:50.021 --> 34:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not expected until early
next week.

34:52.257 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now for more on the
Iranian elections
and what may come next is Thomas
Erdbrink.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the Tehran bureau chief for
The New York
Times.

35:01.166 --> 35:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thomas, we have heard several
headlines today
that the polls have been full of
people, the

35:06.871 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lines have been long and that
they're extending
voting. What have you seen on
the ground?

35:10.075 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK, The New York
Times: That's
definitely what I have seen as
well, especially

35:14.279 --> 35:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the more middle-class areas
of Tehran.

35:17.816 --> 35:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You should know that Tehran is a
city of 12
million people, has a lot of
different areas,

35:22.354 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but up in the north and the west
of the city,
you could see long lines at each
polling station

35:28.193 --> 35:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost throughout the day, from
the morning
all the way up to the evening.
There were

35:33.365 --> 35:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four extensions in some areas,
so people over
there really wanted to go out
and vote.

35:39.104 --> 35:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you would go down to
the south of
Tehran, where more poorer people
live, you

35:47.312 --> 35:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would see a different picture,
half-empty
polling stations, maybe
half-a-dozen people

35:52.917 --> 35:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around casting their ballots.
So, there was
a big divide in Tehran.

35:57.155 --> 36:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, I have no idea
what it, nationwide,
looked like, but at least one
thing is for

36:02.861 --> 36:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure. There was a very high
turnout among
Tehran's middle classes, the
same people who

36:08.033 --> 36:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have supported President Rouhani
in the past
and are clearly, by voting in
this parliamentary

36:13.071 --> 36:15.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
elections, also trying to
support him now.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have also
heard that
this is not -- this is certainly
not like

36:18.710 --> 36:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an American election, and that
there has already
been a pre-selection of who is
allowed to

36:23.448 --> 36:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
run for many of the open seats.

36:26.484 --> 36:32.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well, of
course, it's always
hard to compare elections
worldwide, but,

36:32.257 --> 36:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yes, it is definitely true.

36:34.192 --> 36:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a clerical council that
is half elected
by the people indirectly and
half appointed

36:40.498 --> 36:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Supreme Leader Khamenei. And
they have
disqualified around 6,000 out of
12,000 candidates

36:48.173 --> 36:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for these two elections that the
Iranians
have been voting for today on
Friday.

36:53.711 --> 36:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people are the gatekeepers
of Iran's
electoral process. And what they
look at is

36:59.551 --> 37:07.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if someone is loyal to the
principles of the
ideology of the Islamic
Republic, if you will,

37:07.292 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and also if he or she is a good
Muslim.

37:09.360 --> 37:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, this also gives
space for
certain political groups not to
have the presence

37:14.766 --> 37:19.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they would like to have in
the political
process. And this is what
happens to the country's

37:19.737 --> 37:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reformists, who saw thousands of
their candidates
actually being disqualified,
but, at the same

37:26.010 --> 37:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, their candidates that were
allowed to
run today called upon people to
massively

37:30.315 --> 37:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go out and vote, which their
supporters actually
did.

37:33.651 --> 37:39.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even with
these constraints
that the clerical council puts
on this process,

37:39.324 --> 37:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what are the moderates or the
reformists hoping
to accomplish?

37:42.827 --> 37:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: This election
is just a stop
in the long road of fighting, if
you will,

37:50.301 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political fighting between
people we could
refer to as reformists vs.,
let's say, hard-liners.

37:59.010 --> 38:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this fight has been going
on for decades,
and the reformers in the last 10
years, in

38:04.349 --> 38:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all honesty, have almost lost
every time.
Now, what they have been trying
to achieve

38:10.088 --> 38:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to make sure that as many of
their supporters,
of the reformer supporters came
out and voted

38:15.960 --> 38:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today in order to prevent these
hard-liners
from keeping their grip on the
Parliament.

38:24.636 --> 38:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what reformist leaders have
been telling
me is actually, any seat we can
win from the

38:30.708 --> 38:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hard-liners is a victory for us.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Thomas Erdbrink,
Tehran bureau chief of The New
York Times,

38:36.714 --> 38:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thanks so much for joining us.

38:37.682 --> 38:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Thanks for
having me.

38:42.287 --> 38:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Academy
Awards will be
given out this Sunday. But
instead of the

38:58.303 --> 39:04.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominees, much of the focus this
year is on,
as the hashtag on Twitter has
it, Oscars so

39:04.876 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
white, and Hollywood's lack of
diversity.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

39:10.615 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Richard Pryor at
the Academy
Awards in 1977:

39:15.887 --> 39:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRYOR, Comedian: I'm
here to explain
why no black people will ever be
nominated

39:24.229 --> 39:25.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for anything.

39:25.463 --> 39:26.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:26.464 --> 39:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Chris Rock 28
years later.

39:29.267 --> 39:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS ROCK, Comedian: We have
four black nominees
tonight. So, great. It's kind of
like the

39:35.640 --> 39:37.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Def Oscar Jam tonight.

39:37.141 --> 39:38.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:39.010 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In some ways,
Hollywood's lack
of diversity is an old story,
but as Rock

39:43.781 --> 39:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prepares to host his second
Oscar ceremony,
and for a second straight year,
no actors

39:50.521 --> 39:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of color were nominated, the
stakes and anger
have risen, including calls for
a boycott

39:56.060 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the event.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JADA PINKETT SMITH, Actress: I
will not be
at the Academy Awards, and I
won't be watching.

40:00.331 --> 40:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Academy of
Motion Pictures,
the group that oversees and
votes on nominations,

40:05.803 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced new rules to develop a
younger,
more diverse Oscar voting pool,
the aim, double

40:11.542 --> 40:14.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the number of female and
minority members
by 2020.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But many see the problem as much
deeper.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPIKE LEE, Director: It goes
further than
the Academy Awards. It has to go
back to the

40:19.917 --> 40:20.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gatekeepers.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC News:
Studios.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPIKE LEE: Yes, the people who
have the green-light
vote.

40:24.322 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IDRIS ELBA, Actor: Talent is
everywhere, but
opportunity isn't. Talent can't
reach opportunity

40:31.229 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unaided.

40:33.131 --> 40:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Idris Elba, whose
performance
in "Beasts of No Nation" was
widely praised,

40:40.772 --> 40:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently spoke of roadblocks he
faced early
in his career.

40:43.508 --> 40:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IDRIS ELBA: I realized I could
only play so
many best friends or gang
leaders. Right?

40:49.180 --> 40:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew that I wasn't going to
land a leading
role. I knew there wasn't enough
imagination,

40:54.185 --> 40:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not yet, for the industry to be
seeing me
as a lead.

40:59.023 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In recent years,
television
has presented more diverse
programming, hit

41:05.563 --> 41:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows like "Orange Is the New
Black" and "Jane
the Virgin."

41:09.267 --> 41:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just last week, ABC made
Channing Dungey,
who helped develop shows like
"Black-ish,"

41:15.039 --> 41:22.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first African-American to
head a network.
But it was only last year that
Viola Davis

41:22.380 --> 41:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became the first black woman to
win an Emmy
for best actress in a drama
series.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She spoke of the obstacles.

41:29.687 --> 41:33.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIOLA DAVIS, Actress: You cannot
win an Emmy
for roles that are simply not
there.

41:33.691 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How host Chris
Rock will address
all of this is now part of the
fun and seriousness

41:40.498 --> 41:41.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Sunday night's ceremony.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS ROCK: Let's do this.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we look at
the situation
and the potential way forward
now with Darnell

41:47.004 --> 41:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hunt, professor of sociology at
UCLA and co-author
of an annual report on Hollywood
diversity,

41:52.844 --> 41:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic
Media Coalition, which advocates
for more

41:57.415 --> 42:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inclusive representation of
Latinos in film
and TV, and Sharon Waxman,
founder of The

42:03.154 --> 42:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wrap, a news site covering the
entertainment
and media industries.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to all three of you.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to start with you,
Darnell Hunt.

42:10.928 --> 42:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And help us first briefly define
the problem
and what you see as its source.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARNELL HUNT, Professor of
Sociology, UCLA:
Well, what we're dealing with is
a disconnect

42:19.971 --> 42:24.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between, on the one hand, the
increasing diversity
of American society -- we're
almost 40 percent

42:24.742 --> 42:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority -- on the other hand,
the fact that,
stubbornly, the industry just
can't seem to

42:31.115 --> 42:32.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make diverse projects.

42:33.050 --> 42:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our study, we find that, on
every front,
people of color and women are
underrepresented,

42:36.254 --> 42:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the camera, in front of
the camera.
And yet we also see, from
audience consumption

42:41.259 --> 42:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patterns, that people of color,
diverse audiences,
crave diverse content.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have a situation where the
people who
are running the industry, and
largely white

42:49.534 --> 42:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
males, aren't in a position to
make the types
of projects that people want.
And that's the

42:53.671 --> 42:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fundamental issue. It's trying
to figure out
how to bring more people in the
room, how

42:57.241 --> 42:59.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to get more voices and
perspective into the
process.

42:59.744 --> 43:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so Alex
Nogales, tell
us how it plays out. You work
sometimes with

43:04.916 --> 43:10.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the experiences of Latinos and
others, what
kind of roles they get or don't
get, what

43:10.621 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind -- what they run up against
as writers
or Directors.

43:13.458 --> 43:15.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX NOGALES, President,
National Hispanic
Media Coalition: Well, they
can't even get

43:16.093 --> 43:17.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

43:17.929 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opportunities are not there.
As Darnell
just said, the problem is that
you have 95

43:21.933 --> 43:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent whites in leadership
positions at
all of the studios, the six
studios here in

43:27.505 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town. And you have a majority of
them being
males. So, they rose up in the
ranks of this

43:35.713 --> 43:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole thing called film, and
they have made
their alliances, they have made
their friendships,

43:41.819 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they have made their
relationships.

43:43.821 --> 43:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when it's time to call
for a new product,
that's who they call in, other
people that

43:50.061 --> 43:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are like them, that are white,
that are male,
and so forth. And the reflection
then doesn't

43:55.399 --> 44:00.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
include us. The jobs are not
there because
the people at the very top are
not making

44:01.038 --> 44:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the decisions that are ones of
inclusion.

44:04.308 --> 44:08.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Sharon
Waxman, is that
the industry you see, that you
cover every

44:08.880 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day? Is it about who you know?
Is it about
overt racism or sexism? Is it
all about money?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What?

44:17.889 --> 44:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON WAXMAN, Editor in Chief,
TheWrap.Com:
Well, I think it's worse than
that because

44:19.857 --> 44:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have a culturally very
liberal entertainment
industry, famously so, in which
people are

44:25.463 --> 44:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politically very much to the
left. You see
that in some of the programming
choices and

44:29.967 --> 44:33.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the messages, whether it's
Norman Lear for
so many years and the television
that he wrote

44:33.604 --> 44:39.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that heavily influenced American
society in
the '70s, or whether you see
that with "Will

44:39.710 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
&amp; Grace" or shows like -- shows
like that
that push the needle forward on
social issues

44:46.717 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the time.

44:48.619 --> 44:56.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is true that the issue of
decision-makers
being primarily white and male,
with some

44:56.561 --> 45:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notable exceptions, has been the
case. I do
think that this is essentially a
small community

45:02.066 --> 45:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people who come up together,
who call on
their friends. If you are in a
studio job

45:06.237 --> 45:10.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you leave a studio job, you
become a producer,
and your buddy then calls you up
and asks

45:10.474 --> 45:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you for your latest pitches.

45:12.510 --> 45:21.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it has to be more thoughtful,
significant
and proactive effort to change
that.

45:21.118 --> 45:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Darnell
Hunt, as
a sociologist, you are studying
individuals

45:25.990 --> 45:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within institutions. Right? And
this is a
primary example. Do you see
successes? Do

45:31.796 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you see places where there has
been progress
made, potential models?

45:37.335 --> 45:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARNELL HUNT: Yes, I think there
are lots
of models.

45:39.904 --> 45:44.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The successes, though,
unfortunately, are
the exceptions to the rule.
Business as usual

45:44.709 --> 45:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the industry, as our report
shows, our
2016 report shows, is more of
the same. It's

45:50.114 --> 45:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under-representation for people
of color and
women.

45:53.517 --> 45:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABC's move, I think, was a very
bold move,
but it made business sense. This
woman had

45:58.489 --> 46:02.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
been the executive vice
president for drama
development. And she was the
person who's

46:02.126 --> 46:05.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsible for a lot of those
Shonda Rhimes
shows that are doing really well
on ABC, as

46:05.730 --> 46:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well as some of their other
prime-time dramas.

46:07.632 --> 46:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it just made sense for her
to become head
of that network because of the
network she

46:13.604 --> 46:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has and the connections she has
with the creative
community. And it's
forward-thinking. It's

46:17.775 --> 46:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at where America is
going. And I think
a lot of ABC's programming kind
of gestures

46:22.813 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
toward that present and that
future.

46:24.649 --> 46:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that other networks
and studios
need to get into this game as
well.

46:28.119 --> 46:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alex Nogales,
continue that
forward thinking for us, if you
would. When

46:31.689 --> 46:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you go to the studio, what are
you saying?
What are you asking for? What's
the pitch?

46:36.794 --> 46:44.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX NOGALES: In the year
2000-2001, the Multi-Ethnic
Media Coalition signed
memorandums of understanding

46:44.702 --> 46:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX. And
for us, that's
a model that we're going to
utilize with the

46:51.709 --> 46:53.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
six studios.

46:53.577 --> 46:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason for that is
because it's working.
It is working slowly, but it's
working.

46:57.615 --> 47:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What does it say?
Tell us specifically,
what does that mean?

47:01.352 --> 47:05.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX NOGALES: That they're going
to diversify
their work force both in front
and in back

47:05.856 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of camera. They're going to give
you -- they're
going to give us the actual
numbers of who

47:10.561 --> 47:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is working in front and in back
of camera,
and that we are going to be
partners in this

47:15.766 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enterprise of diversifying the
work force.

47:19.036 --> 47:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's working on television
slowly, but it's
working. Now we have to make it
work as well

47:24.075 --> 47:25.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in film.

47:25.910 --> 47:29.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Sharon
Waxman, to the extent
that this is an old issue, is it
possible

47:29.880 --> 47:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tell yet how much of an
impact all the
most recent kind of anger and
uproar has had

47:36.687 --> 47:37.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or might have?

47:37.655 --> 47:39.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHARON WAXMAN: Right.

47:39.557 --> 47:44.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and
Sciences, which governs the
Oscars, has adopted

47:44.729 --> 47:53.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very significant changes in the
wake of this
latest protest. They are going
to try to double

47:53.237 --> 47:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the number of minorities and
women in the
Academy voting membership by the
year 2020,

47:58.175 --> 48:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're phasing out people
who haven't
been active in the Academy -- or
in the industry

48:03.280 --> 48:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- sorry -- for the past 10
years.

48:05.716 --> 48:09.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if that's going to
really make
the change that they need. This
really means

48:10.087 --> 48:14.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they need to admit a lot of
people of color
and a lot of women over the next
five years.

48:15.092 --> 48:21.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to find those qualified
people. People
do want to see change, but there
is no stakeholder

48:21.665 --> 48:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with power within the industry
that has the
wherewithal to drive that
change.

48:27.138 --> 48:31.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they always end up being
kind of window
dressing. So, I would be curious
to see. I

48:31.142 --> 48:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be -- hope, for Alex
Nogales' sake and
for all of our sakes, that those
agreements

48:36.080 --> 48:39.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he signed really do lead to
substantive
change.

48:39.683 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I do think that public
shaming is not
a bad way to do that, which is
what has happened

48:44.255 --> 48:50.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year. But, ultimately,
these are media
companies that answer to their
shareholders,

48:50.194 --> 48:54.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we can't -- we have to make
an economic
argument for that. And I think
there is a

48:54.298 --> 48:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strong economic argument for
that.

48:56.233 --> 49:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Darnell Hunt,
just a brief
last word. Are you hopeful as
this point as

49:00.738 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we prepare to watch the Oscars?

49:02.640 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARNELL HUNT: Well, you know,
I'm a cautious
optimist. I think we have to
keep applying

49:05.709 --> 49:07.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the pressure.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no magic bullet. We
have to approach
this from every front. The
economic argument

49:10.181 --> 49:15.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a strong one. Our study shows
inconclusive
-- I mean, shows conclusively
that, you know,

49:15.452 --> 49:17.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diversity sells.

49:17.354 --> 49:20.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Audiences of color are craving
that content,
and shows that are diverse, on
average, do

49:20.724 --> 49:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better on ratings and movies do
better at
the box office. So, we just have
to keep amassing

49:25.596 --> 49:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the data. It's there, and it's
only going
to become more profound as time
goes on, as

49:29.934 --> 49:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the population becomes more
diverse.

49:31.869 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Darnell Hunt,
Alex Nogales,
and Sharon Waxman, thank you,
all three, very

JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can tune
in tonight
for the entire show, "In
Performance at the

51:48.038 --> 51:51.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House." That's on most PBS
stations.

51:51.508 --> 51:54.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An update to a story that aired
last night.

51:54.345 --> 51:59.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tijuana, Mexico's police chief,
Alejandro
Lares, resigned today after he
was asked to

51:59.783 --> 52:05.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave by city officials. This
comes one day
after an investigation aired
here on the "NewsHour"

52:05.222 --> 52:12.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by public TV station KPBS
looking at the city's
strategy, arrests and police
raids of homeless

52:12.363 --> 52:14.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
migrants.

52:14.365 --> 52:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: For
food and travel
lovers, the ultimate experience
is being able

52:19.336 --> 52:25.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to eat like a local. Now, thanks
to the sharing
economy, you can. Much like
Airbnb, the site

52:26.076 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Traveling Spoon connects
travelers with hosts,
but, instead of a bed, you get a
home-cooked

52:31.682 --> 52:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meal. We visited a home chef in
Mexico recently
to try it out. You can read
about that and

52:36.854 --> 52:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a recipe for his famous
stuffed peppers.

52:40.124 --> 52:45.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And see how the presidential
candidates stack
up when it comes to the fastest
growing expense

52:45.763 --> 52:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the nation's health care
budget. That's
prescription drug costs. We have
a report

52:50.401 --> 52:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Kaiser Health News on our
home page.

52:53.203 --> 52:56.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later. Here's a
preview:

53:06.350 --> 53:12.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's fair to say
nobody saw this
week coming. The Republican
Senate threw down

53:12.656 --> 53:17.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gauntlet at the Democratic
White House
on Guantanamo and the Supreme
Court. And the

53:17.494 --> 53:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gloves came off, dramatically
and noisily,
in the Republican race for the
presidential

53:22.900 --> 53:27.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination. Who will blink? Not
sure I have
an answer, but we will try to
explain how

53:27.404 --> 53:31.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's come to this tonight on
"Washington Week"
-- Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" Saturday:
why some Iranian-Americans fear
they could

53:37.714 --> 53:41.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be in violation of U.S.
sanctions against
Iran.

53:41.185 --> 53:43.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMAL ABDI, National Iranian
American Council:
An average Iranian-American who
has family

53:43.687 --> 53:48.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iran, unless they're willing
to spend all
the time to do due diligence,
there's nothing

53:48.292 --> 53:50.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they can do that doesn't
potentially violate
the sanctions.

53:50.961 --> 53:53.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD NEPHEW, Brookings
Institution: Sanctions
are only as good as the
psychological fear

53:53.831 --> 53:58.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they create in people engaged in
illicit conduct.
You want them to be afraid of
breaking the

53:58.735 --> 54:00.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

54:00.170 --> 54:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

54:02.940 --> 54:05.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

54:06.009 --> 54:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank you,
and good
night.
