ALONG IN TESTING, CONTINUE

10:56.500 --> 10:58.133
MOVING THAT FORWARD.

10:58.133 --> 11:00.667
THE RISKIER STUFF, MOR

11:00.667 --> 11:01.633
CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, OFTEN

11:01.633 --> 11:02.900
THAT GETS TERMINATED

THOUGH PROGRAMS COULD GET KILLED

11:14.533 --> 11:15.300
OFF OR DIE OFF

11:15.300 --> 11:17.433

11:18.600 --> 11:20.133
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE

RARE DISEASES.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.500
BUT THE FEWER COMPANIES LOOKIN

12:01.667 --> 12:03.233
THAT'S FINE WHEN THERE'S 20 BI

FIVE REMAINING THAT ARE IN THA

12:13.733 --> 12:14.167
