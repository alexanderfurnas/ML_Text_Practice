00:41.575 --> 00:44.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY DIESU, DisruptJ20: The
point is to set
a tone of resistance from the
first moment

00:44.878 --> 00:46.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he's in office.

00:46.146 --> 00:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

01:06.733 --> 01:12.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief Justice John Roberts
administered the
oath at noon, as Mr. Trump
assumed his first

01:12.406 --> 01:13.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public office.

01:13.874 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is how this Inauguration
Day unfolded.

01:18.845 --> 01:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Donald and Melania Trump,
the first public
appearance of this inaugural day
came at a

01:24.217 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning church service at St.
John's Episcopal
in Washington.

01:28.922 --> 01:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect had already
begun his
day around 4:30 a.m. with a
trademark tweet.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It proclaimed: "The movement
continues.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The work begins."

01:40.400 --> 01:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, at the White House,
the outgoing
president left the traditional
note for his

01:45.339 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
successor on his Oval Office
desk.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: Good morning, everybody.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

01:50.110 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Good morning, sir.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

final nostalgic
stroll next to the Rose Garden.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Mr.
President-Elect, how are
you?

01:56.950 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obamas then
welcomed the
Trumps for a reception of coffee
and tea,

02:02.122 --> 02:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before motorcading to the U.S.
Capitol.

02:05.359 --> 02:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands had already gathered
there despite
a light rain and tight security,
having faced

02:12.666 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests at several security
checkpoints,
as police in riot gear battled
demonstrators

02:19.172 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
elsewhere in the city.

02:21.041 --> 02:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, the crowd on the
National Mall appeared
well short of the one that
celebrated Mr.

02:26.713 --> 02:30.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama's first inauguration.

02:30.384 --> 02:34.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 60 congressional
Democrats boycotted
the ceremony.

02:34.421 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But other dignitaries filled the
West Front
of the Capitol, including former
Presidents

02:39.693 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush,
and Bill Clinton,
with his wife, former Secretary
of State Hillary

02:46.633 --> 02:51.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, who lost the November
election to
Mr. Trump.

02:51.538 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Hail to the Chief" played a
final time for
President Obama.

02:56.877 --> 03:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentleman,
the president-elect
of the United States, Donald

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:05.152 --> 03:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then the
president-elect
himself was announced, to
cheers.

03:09.156 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, the political divisions
laid bare in
the election were on display.

03:14.795 --> 03:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scattered jeering greeted Senate
Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer when he
addressed the

03:19.633 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crowd.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: We
face threats, foreign and
domestic.

03:24.871 --> 03:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In such times, faith in our
government, our
institutions and even our
country can erode.

03:35.182 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite these challenges, I
stand here today
confident in this great country
for one reason:

03:43.323 --> 03:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you, the American people.

03:45.926 --> 03:51.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The crowd cheered
again when

the oath of office to Vice

CLARENCE THOMAS, Associate

U.S. Supreme Court: Would you
raise your right

03:55.836 --> 03:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hand and repeat after me?

03:57.471 --> 04:02.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Mormon
Tabernacle Choir
performed "America the

04:02.642 --> 04:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: I, Donald John Trump, do
solemnly

04:13.720 --> 04:15.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
swear...

04:15.589 --> 04:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the nation's
45th president
took the oath of office,
administered by Chief

04:19.493 --> 04:21.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Justice John Roberts.

04:21.661 --> 04:25.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:25.565 --> 04:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new president
was greeted
by trumpets and cannon salutes
and by scattered

04:34.608 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouts of "Not my president."

04:36.977 --> 04:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, as the rain resumed,
Donald Trump delivered
his first address as president,
a message

04:44.151 --> 04:48.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of economic populism that
portrayed a nation
struggling.

04:48.054 --> 04:54.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: For too many of
our citizens,
a different reality exists,
mothers and children

04:54.394 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trapped in poverty in our inner
cities, rusted-out
factories scattered like
tombstones across

05:01.601 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the landscape of our nation, an
education
system flush with cash, but
which leaves our

05:10.076 --> 05:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young and beautiful students
deprived of all
knowledge, and the crime and the
gangs and

05:18.985 --> 05:26.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the drugs that have stolen too
many lives
and robbed our country of so
much unrealized

05:26.326 --> 05:28.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
potential.

05:28.728 --> 05:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This American carnage stops
right here and
stops right now.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:38.038 --> 05:44.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Instead, the
president declared
a new vision will now guide the
government,

05:44.244 --> 05:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his words, only America
first.

05:46.479 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will fight for
you with every
breath in my body, and I will
never, ever

05:54.621 --> 05:56.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let you down.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:57.591 --> 06:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:03.496 --> 06:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

and future progress.

06:24.517 --> 06:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We will no longer
accept politicians
who are all talk and no action,
constantly

06:31.258 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complaining, but never doing
anything about
it.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

talk is over.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

to mountain, from ocean to
ocean, hear these
words.

06:56.516 --> 06:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

All right?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:01.741 --> 09:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, with
that, the former
first couple flew to Palm
Springs, California,

09:05.478 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a vacation.

09:09.115 --> 09:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in the city, a new, more
violent protest
broke out, with dozens arrested.

09:13.453 --> 09:18.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, at the Capitol, the
business of the day
went ahead without interruption.

09:18.158 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his first official acts,
President Trump
signed a proclamation calling
for a national

09:22.695 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day of patriotism on September
11.

09:26.065 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also formally submitted his
Cabinet nominations
to the Senate, and signed a
waiver that clears

09:31.070 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the way for his defense
secretary pick, retired
General James Mattis.

09:38.144 --> 09:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, the Trumps entered
Statuary Hall
for the traditional
post-inaugural luncheon

09:42.816 --> 09:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a presidential gesture to
his defeated
opponent.

09:45.518 --> 09:50.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I was very
honored, very, very
honored, when I heard that
President Bill

09:50.723 --> 09:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and Secretary Hillary
Clinton was
coming today.

09:53.726 --> 09:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it's appropriate to
say.

09:54.727 --> 09:55.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:55.829 --> 09:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I would like
you to stand
up.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would like you to stand up.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

10:04.604 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Then it was
back outside
for a ceremonial review of the
troops, and

10:08.208 --> 10:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the trip down Pennsylvania
Avenue, from the
Capitol to the White House.

10:11.911 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protests continued, but the
parade proceeded
without interruption.

10:17.817 --> 10:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along the way, the president got
out to greet
supporters.

10:21.754 --> 10:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the afternoon turned into the
evening,
the first family watched the
parade from the

10:27.594 --> 10:28.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
White House viewing box.

10:28.628 --> 10:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

10:35.168 --> 10:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, our John Yang
was on the
platform on the West Side of the
Capitol for

10:40.440 --> 10:42.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
today's ceremony.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John, you had a view most of us
didn't.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were right there next to it.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was really interesting to
watch.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a fascinating day.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was full of tradition.

10:53.052 --> 10:57.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It seemed like any other
inaugural, but, at
the same time, it was different,
the heckling

10:57.056 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the administering of the
oath that
you talked about.

11:01.895 --> 11:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you had the former living --
the living
former presidents, all except
George Herbert

11:06.266 --> 11:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walker Bush, who is hospitalized
in Houston,
all there, all there to -- I
think especially

11:12.972 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the contentious
nature of this
election, there to see the
transfer of power.

11:19.112 --> 11:24.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, they
didn't seem very
enthusiastic about the speech.

11:24.684 --> 11:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George W. Bush hardly applauded
at all during
the speech, looked rather
stony-faced.

11:30.356 --> 11:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when a reporter asked him
afterward what
he thought of the speech, his
reply was, "Good

11:36.529 --> 11:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to see you again" -- Judy.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:40.733 --> 11:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John -- so,
John, we reported
that the new president has
already signed

11:44.137 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some executive orders.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of it is routine, but some
of it significant.

11:48.308 --> 11:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are you learning about what
he plans
to do in the first few days he's
in office?

11:53.112 --> 11:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There is going to be
a lot of activity.

11:55.582 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to see a lot of
executive orders
signed in the first week,
starting Monday,

12:00.186 --> 12:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're told by Sean Spicer, the
new White House
press secretary.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those will be more substantive,
dealing with
policy.

12:06.859 --> 12:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're told that immigration
certainly will
be at the top of the list, trade
issues, sort

12:13.866 --> 12:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the issues that he ran on
that were the
signatures of his campaign.

12:18.538 --> 12:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of them will be undoing
what President
Obama did over the past eight
years with executive

12:23.943 --> 12:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions, because he faced
obstacles in Congress.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of it will be furthering
their own agenda.

12:29.682 --> 12:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they say they have got a
plan, an action
plan, not just for the first 100
days, but

12:35.421 --> 12:37.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the first 200 days.

12:37.223 --> 12:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds like
enough to keep
you and the rest of the press
following this

12:41.494 --> 12:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new president really busy.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang, thank you.

12:45.598 --> 12:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what to make of this day one
of the Trump
presidency?

12:50.336 --> 12:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here with me now are "NewsHour"
regulars syndicated
columnist Mark Shields and New
York Times

12:55.475 --> 13:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
columnist David Brooks, and from
our politics
Monday team, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

13:01.648 --> 13:02.615 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Also joining us, Barry Bennett.

13:04.083 --> 13:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was campaign manager for Ben
Carson in
the Republican primaries.

13:08.087 --> 13:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He then served as an adviser to
the Trump
campaign.

13:11.224 --> 13:15.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From George Washington
University, politics
scientist Lara Brown.

13:15.862 --> 13:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karine Jean-Pierre, she was a
senior adviser
to MoveOn.org during the 2016
elections.

13:22.335 --> 13:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Matt Schlapp, he is chair of
the American
Conservative Union.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He joins us from downtown
Washington.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can see the Capitol behind
you, Matt.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let me start with the
"NewsHour" regulars,
Mark Shields and David Brooks.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, I will start with you.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the main takeaway from
this day?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I feel
underdressed.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:40.286 --> 13:41.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:41.554 --> 13:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You have got that
blue-collar
Republican look.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's the new
populist moment.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:46.259 --> 13:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The story of the
day was the
really unabashed populism and
nationalism

13:52.999 --> 13:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Trump speech.

13:54.534 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I'm left with two big
questions: How
big is this nationalist moment?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been spread around the
world.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Theresa May just gave an anti --
how they're
going to withdraw from Brexit,
the U.K. Le

14:05.545 --> 14:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pen is looking good in France.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putin is riding high.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's an international
movement.

14:11.751 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of sort of dismiss as sort
of a product
of a receding bit of history,
but maybe it's

14:17.423 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 21st century.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe Trump is riding
something, and he
will be able to marshal a
left-right populist

14:22.462 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a possibility we should
be open to,
especially because the
anti-populists, people

14:26.799 --> 14:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who believe in global trade and
global movements,
have no guts, no articulation,
and really

14:30.303 --> 14:31.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no opposition.

14:31.838 --> 14:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the second thing, how
is he going
to turn this into policy?

14:35.908 --> 14:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does an outsider who runs
against Washington
actually rally Washington to
launch his agenda?

14:41.681 --> 14:42.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's just a gigantic
challenge.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields?

14:44.650 --> 14:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: In 1940, there
were 137 million
people in the United States of
America and

14:50.790 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- 132 million -- and there were
600,000 more
factory jobs than there are
today.

14:56.229 --> 15:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were eight million more
factory jobs
in this country than when Jimmy
Carter was

15:01.167 --> 15:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of the United States.

15:04.070 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump represents a
real grievance,
a real constituency.

15:10.309 --> 15:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I could not get over in
the speech
today -- and I don't know what
the global

15:14.213 --> 15:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact or meaning is, but I do
know that it
was unlike any inaugural address
I have ever

15:21.521 --> 15:22.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heard.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a call to arms to those
already enlisted
in his army.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no attempt to reach
across the divide.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no attempt to heal
wounds.

15:29.929 --> 15:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no attempt to reassure
or allay
fears of those who were
apprehensive and not

15:36.702 --> 15:38.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported him.

15:38.337 --> 15:45.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in that sense, it was almost
unique, at
least in the speeches I have
heard.

15:45.244 --> 15:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was an unbridled attack
upon those
presidents spoke of who were --
in William's

15:50.383 --> 15:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece who were sitting on the
dais with him,
having praised the Obamas in one
sentence

15:57.290 --> 16:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for being magnificent, and then
saying that
this small group who have
profited in Washington

16:02.962 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been indifferent, and
almost cruelly
so, to the rest of the country.

16:07.834 --> 16:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I just stand in the midnight
in America,
American carnage, which is, I
think, soon-to-be

16:17.410 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
canceled TV series, but I just
have never
heard language quite like it or
a tone quite

16:22.915 --> 16:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like it in an inaugural address.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Schlapp,
since you're
so well-dressed, I'm going to
call on you

16:29.355 --> 16:30.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:31.357 --> 16:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you
hear?

16:32.358 --> 16:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you taking away?

16:34.026 --> 16:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: Boy, I
just -- what

16:35.828 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say to Mark is, is that
I think one
of the things that was ironic
is, you had

16:38.965 --> 16:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump up on that dais,
who hasn't been
a Republican for very long, and
who is basically

16:47.773 --> 16:51.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a function of the fact that both
those parties
and many of those party leaders
and some of

16:51.744 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those former presidents didn't
listen to the
American people.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama will leave
office with higher
approval ratings, but still
two-thirds of

17:01.320 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this nation believe that we're
on the wrong
track.

17:04.257 --> 17:09.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the demonstration of
the economic
pain and the unrest and unease
about what's

17:09.562 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happening overseas is high.

17:12.198 --> 17:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, what struck me
about the address,
about the speech is that he is
connecting

17:19.505 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the political moment.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The political moment is not
about morning.

17:24.577 --> 17:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about -- a little bit about
M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G,
and the fact that there is
nothing wrong with

17:31.183 --> 17:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Republican connecting to the
fact that a
lot of Americans are hurting.

17:35.821 --> 17:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I agree you have to offer
solutions and
you have to be optimistic and
you have to

17:39.926 --> 17:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead them someplace, but it's
important to
listen to them and to connect to
them.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why Donald Trump is
the president.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to Matt's point, there was a
lot of Donald
Trump on the campaign trail
where he seemed

17:53.773 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to switch positions.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really didn't know -- and I
still think
we don't know -- where exactly
his ideological

17:58.978 --> 18:00.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
core is.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was one thing that was
consistent
throughout.

18:02.915 --> 18:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the same message we saw
today in his
inaugural speech was the message
that we saw

18:08.754 --> 18:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the campaign trial, was the
message that
we saw at the convention.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That has never changed at all.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's what won him the
nomination, when nobody
thought he was going to be able
to do that.

18:17.663 --> 18:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's what won him the
presidency, when,
quite frankly, even going into
the election

18:21.233 --> 18:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night, nobody really believed
that he was
going to be able to win this.

18:25.104 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he is taking that same
message and
he is going to bring it to the
White House

18:30.643 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

18:32.511 --> 18:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was something that he
truly, you know,
as I said, has stuck with
throughout the course

18:37.316 --> 18:38.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of his campaign.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he believes that, if he
succeeds, other
people are going to join.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reaching out is not about
reaching out
to say, well, I'm going to take
other people's

18:44.490 --> 18:46.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opinions and views.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, I'm going to do so well,
I'm going to
be so -- we're going to make
America so great,

18:50.262 --> 18:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that people who oppose me now
are going to
have to come on board.

18:53.065 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that what's
going to happen,
Karine Jean-Pierre, somebody who
worked against

18:56.936 --> 18:58.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his election?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist:
Yes, look, it was -- and I said
this before

19:00.873 --> 19:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- it was very disappointing.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a right-wing nationalism
speech.

19:05.378 --> 19:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very reminiscent of the
RNC convention
speech, when he accepted his
nomination, had

19:11.083 --> 19:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that dooms and glooms type of
feel.

19:13.853 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think the most
disappointing part of
it was, there are people here
who are genuinely

19:19.658 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fearful because of the type of
campaign that
he ran and the people that he
insulted.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he didn't do anything to
mend those wounds.

19:28.267 --> 19:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as president, that's what
people look
to our leader to do.

19:32.972 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he missed a really
important opportunity
as we were going through the
peaceful transfer

19:38.544 --> 19:39.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of power.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Barry Bennett,
missed an opportunity?

19:41.147 --> 19:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT, Former Trump
Campaign Senior
Adviser: I don't think so.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think beauty is in the eye of
the beholder
here.

19:45.718 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His supporters, me included, we
don't want
to half-a-loaf, right?

19:51.490 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We want him to fight.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And today was the beginning of a
fight.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't the end of a campaign.

19:56.629 --> 20:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to see from the left
the protests
are big and energetic, and they
are going

20:00.766 --> 20:02.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be so tomorrow.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we want him to fight back.

20:04.270 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we saw today
was, Monday
morning, the fight is still
going to be there.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what we -- I think
the country
needs.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Should people be
fearful, as
Karine was just saying?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: I don't think so,
no.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You shake your
head no.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY BENNETT: No.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I think no.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are people here illegally.

20:21.754 --> 20:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They should be fearful that
they're here illegally,
because, you know, they should
be deported.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or, you know, the law says they
should be
deported.

20:29.028 --> 20:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, I mean, if you're here
illegally, of
course you're not going to be
deported.

20:33.799 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's silly.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's fear-mongering.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are looking at
-- we have
been interspersing our
conversation with pictures

20:38.537 --> 20:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that inaugural parade still
going on an
hour after sunset here in
Washington, but

20:43.642 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's still going on, members of
the Trump
family seated at that reviewing
stand just

20:48.314 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literally right in -- built
right in front
of the White House.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're watching that.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're keeping half-an-eye on the
parade, but
we also really want to hear what
everybody

20:56.489 --> 20:58.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here has to say.

20:58.290 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lara Brown, it is dark at the
White House,
but Donald Trump is going to
bring light to

21:02.228 --> 21:03.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:05.231 --> 21:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARA BROWN, Director, George
Washington University
Graduate School of Political
Management: Well,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that that's precisely
the problem.

21:08.134 --> 21:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe he is going to continue to
bring the
fight to Washington, but there
was no acknowledgment

21:11.470 --> 21:12.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he had won.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His party has won.

21:14.573 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most important
aspects of an inaugural
speech is to actually end the
campaign, to

21:22.248 --> 21:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move beyond the campaign, to
bring about a
sense of reconciliation and
unity with all

21:28.554 --> 21:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those who fought fiercely
against you.

21:32.458 --> 21:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is also this
other piece
where he failed to recognize his
moment in

21:38.097 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

21:40.065 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't acknowledge past
presidents, those
who are sort of lions in the
pantheon of presidents,

21:45.437 --> 21:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it's Thomas Jefferson,
or Abraham
Lincoln, or George Washington.

21:49.375 --> 21:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't notice or witness the
ceremony as
being important in history.

21:55.247 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Bill Clinton, who came
to office
with only 43 percent of the
popular vote,

22:00.586 --> 22:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began his speech by talking
about how this
speech takes place in the dead
of winter,

22:06.592 --> 22:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that part of the words and
the faces of
the people are about forcing the
spring, that

22:13.832 --> 22:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there is a sense of renewal.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Trump didn't provide that.

22:17.436 --> 22:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Schlapp, and
we should
say the reason you are dressed
up is because

22:20.940 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are going to one of the
inaugural balls.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I failed to point that out
earlier.

22:24.743 --> 22:25.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:25.744 --> 22:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or maybe...

22:27.580 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: No, I think it --
Judy, I think
it's because they think people
like me live

22:29.582 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Thurston Howell III.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:33.419 --> 22:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about Lara
Brown's point,
though, that we didn't hear from
the new president...

22:38.057 --> 22:39.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

22:39.825 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... a connection
to history,
to his place in the grand
pantheon that is

22:44.964 --> 22:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the history of the United
States?

22:46.532 --> 22:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Look, if you want
poetry, there
was another candidate for you.

22:50.903 --> 22:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump was the candidate
of very blunt,
realistic talk.

22:56.442 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, if you look through
what politicians
tend to do -- and, obviously, I
worked for

23:01.213 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President George W. Bush in the
White House,
with Barry Bennett's wife, I
might say.

23:06.085 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is definitely thought,
great thought
that goes into these speeches.

23:11.290 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But so many times, what the
voters -- what
the voter hears and then what
they see in

23:15.694 --> 23:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their lives, there can be a bit
of phoniness,
obviously, to politics.

23:19.832 --> 23:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what Donald Trump
did, I think
what everyone on the panel is
failing to understand

23:23.469 --> 23:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that I think the biggest part
of the speech
was that he broke it down in
very basic terms

23:29.041 --> 23:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them, and he made a pledge
to them.

23:31.443 --> 23:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he's going to fight for
them, and
he's not going to let them down.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Boy, it's not a small pledge.

23:37.082 --> 23:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a high bar, to me, which
is he's going
to change, literally change
society and change

23:42.621 --> 23:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way government does these
things.

23:44.723 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that it was bold for
him to do
that.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there was a lot of
people -- I
will tell you, I talked to a lot
of people

23:50.429 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on the street today, and
they just like
the fact there is an
authenticity and a directness.

23:55.801 --> 23:59.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see how it works over
the years, but
I think it's very promising.

23:59.805 --> 24:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
bold and authentic.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Utopian.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to eradicate disease.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He literally said that.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think it was authentic.

24:08.514 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think it was bold, a
bold -- boldest
mostly on its attack on the
Republican Party.

24:13.852 --> 24:17.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a party that has always --
never believed
in zero sum thinking.

24:17.222 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started as the Whig Party,
which was based
on the idea in part that labor
and capital

24:21.360 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't have to fight.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was enough for all of us
in the growing
pie.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican Party, through
all its permutations,
has basically believed in that.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since the Cold War, it's
believed in growth
abroad is good for growth at
home, democracy

24:32.938 --> 24:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abroad is good for democracy at
home.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not an America-first
philosophy.

24:36.942 --> 24:39.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's not the zero-sum
philosophy that we
heard from Donald Trump.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's not the combative
philosophy we heard
from Donald Trump.

24:42.081 --> 24:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's a stark and a bold
attempt to reshape
his own party.

24:46.852 --> 24:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether he can successfully do
that, I'm,
frankly, dubious about.

24:51.156 --> 24:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether he can successfully
effect change
in government, when he's so
anti-institutional

24:56.128 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not even willing to embrace
the institution
of the presidency, it's --
again, I'm dubious

25:01.100 --> 25:02.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But bold, I give him credit for.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
just quickly,
did you hear signs, signals --
did you signals

25:07.306 --> 25:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today that Donald Trump will be
able to make
the changes he says he's going
to make?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I didn't.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't see anything unifying
or uplifting
in this speech.

25:17.950 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that successful
inaugurals in
the past -- I mean, they may be
writing a

25:22.554 --> 25:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new chapter, but I didn't -- I
thought that
was missing from the speech.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
that's what
we should be judging the speech
on?

25:29.294 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think you
have to view
the speech as identifying
yourself in history,

25:34.666 --> 25:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acknowledging who you are,
acknowledging humility,
acknowledging the importance of
the country

25:40.939 --> 25:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and its diversity and its
strength through
that diversity, and your appeal
to the people

25:47.679 --> 25:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who didn't support you and your
pledge to
them.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just -- to me, it's
politics 101.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he was playing to his
base.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's continuing to play to his
base.

25:58.590 --> 26:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Matt isn't too busy going
to his nighttime
affairs, he could tell us who
the candidate

26:04.463 --> 26:06.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of poetry was in 2016.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:07.332 --> 26:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Was that Rick
Perry?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Did I miss it?

26:09.334 --> 26:10.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or was it Scott Walker?

26:10.469 --> 26:11.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I missed it.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:12.938 --> 26:14.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I wish we -- do
you want to
answer that, just quickly?

26:14.973 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: It wasn't Hillary
Clinton.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It definitely wasn't Hillary
Clinton.

26:17.709 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:18.710 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will bring you
back on.

26:19.678 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can answer that.

26:20.679 --> 26:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I won't put you on the spot.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have only got about a minute
left.

26:23.582 --> 26:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, I'm hearing two very
different sets of
views here about what Donald
Trump accomplished

26:28.587 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or didn't today.

26:30.422 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: If his goal was to
-- and it's
been his goal from the entire
course of this

26:35.360 --> 26:36.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a vision and a message
about shaking
up Washington.

26:38.664 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's going to do things
differently.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not going to do it in a
traditional manner.

26:41.867 --> 26:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't care about the
trappings of this.

26:46.271 --> 26:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you either believe that or
you don't believe
that.

26:50.342 --> 26:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he will be successful based
on a Washington
working for him, despite the
fact that he

26:56.448 --> 26:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doesn't think Washington works.

26:58.350 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have how
many days,
365 times four, to talk about
what he accomplished

27:05.157 --> 27:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today and what he may accomplish
in the future.

27:07.493 --> 27:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to thank each one of you,
Mark Shields,
David Brooks, Amy Walter, Lara
Brown, Karine

27:12.431 --> 27:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jean-Pierre, Barry Bennett, and
Matt Schlapp.

27:15.868 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You all get a chance to come
back and weigh
in one more time -- or many more
times on

27:20.172 --> 27:21.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:22.174 --> 27:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks very much.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LARA BROWN: Thank you.

27:26.812 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks,
Judy.

27:31.450 --> 27:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we heard,
there were vocal
opponents of the president,
thousands of them,

27:38.023 --> 27:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protesting across Washington
throughout the
day.

27:40.726 --> 27:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Most of them were peaceful.

27:42.027 --> 27:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a number of incidents turned
violent late
this afternoon.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A limousine was set on fire
downtown.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Smoke could be seen for blocks
away.

27:50.702 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And protesters hurled trash
cans, flash bombs
and objects at police, who used
pepper spray

27:56.108 --> 27:57.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in return.

27:57.442 --> 28:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By this evening, at least 217
people were
arrested.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Six police officers were
injured.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown and our team have
been out on
the streets all day.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's what they saw.

28:08.554 --> 28:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Donald Trump
has got to go!

28:12.157 --> 28:17.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was a
disparate group of
protesters coming together to
march, express

28:17.195 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their resistance to the new
administration,
and air their anger at what some
see as an

28:21.667 --> 28:23.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illegitimate president.

28:23.435 --> 28:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I couldn't just sit at
home and let
this be -- like, Trump's
administration be

28:28.173 --> 28:29.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
normalized.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Robby Diesu is an
organizer
of one of the lead umbrella
groups called

28:32.544 --> 28:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DisruptJ20, Inauguration Day.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBBY DIESU, DisruptJ20: Our
goal is to disrupt
it, just like our name says.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have definitely been
disrupting it
all day.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Disrupting, but
in a few moments
from now when we're talking,
Donald Trump

28:43.188 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be president.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY DIESU: Yes, but we were
not under impression
that we would stop him from
becoming president.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is to set a tone of
resistance from
the first moment that he is in
office.

28:52.130 --> 28:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One act of
disruption, at security
checkpoints leading into the
National Mall,

28:58.770 --> 29:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demonstrators attempted to block
access to
the inauguration, chaining
themselves together

29:03.108 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and refusing to move.

29:05.043 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In another, protesters shut down
part of a
major highway near the Capitol.

29:09.348 --> 29:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McPherson Square in downtown
Washington, D.C.,
has been ground zero for
protesters all day.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From here, different groups have
fanned out
around the city, some marching
peacefully,

29:19.091 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others more violent.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At times, the peaceful burst
into the violent.

29:24.830 --> 29:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a tense standoff at 12th
and K Streets,
police used pepper spray and
flash grenades

29:29.768 --> 29:31.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to disperse the crowd.

29:31.536 --> 29:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, protesters dressed in
black threw
rocks and flash bombs and
smashed windows,

29:36.541 --> 29:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading to more confrontations,
injuries and
arrests.

29:40.545 --> 29:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These demonstrators used tactics
associated
with so-called black bloc
anarchist groups,

29:45.617 --> 29:50.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long prevalent in Europe, often
seizing the
moment amid more peaceful
protests.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This afternoon, D.C.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a
statement: "Again,
I respect your right to
peacefully protest,

29:56.995 --> 30:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the damage that has occurred
today is
unacceptable and not welcome in
D.C."

30:02.534 --> 30:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For most who came out, though,
today was a
day to come together and plan
for the future.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with this couple who
came from New
Hampshire.

30:09.241 --> 30:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: There's a lot of folks
feel like they
are not heard, that they are not
represented,

30:12.477 --> 30:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they -- their voices do not
matter any
way, shape, and/or form.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just reminding folks
that even though
the -- he is president -- we
respect that

30:19.518 --> 30:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact, because that fact is a
fact -- that
that doesn't mean that, over the
next eight

30:24.523 --> 30:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- four to eight years, whatever
ends up happening,
that those voices won't matter,
that those

30:29.461 --> 30:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voices will not be a part of the
conversation,
that those thoughts and those
opinions will

30:32.998 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not be a part of the
conversation.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just wanted to make it a point
to say that
they will.

30:37.002 --> 30:41.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The National Park
Service gave
out 22 permits for First
Amendment events,

30:41.540 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
considerably more than in
previous inaugurations,
when some half-dozen were
requested.

30:46.044 --> 30:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 3,000 police and 5,000
National
Guard were on hand, and security
expenses

30:51.783 --> 30:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the day are expected to
exceed $100 million.

30:56.388 --> 31:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protests today also occurred
well beyond Washington,
from marches in Denver to across
San Francisco's

31:02.127 --> 31:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Golden Gate Bridge, and around
the world.

31:05.230 --> 31:10.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In London, demonstrators
unfurled banners
from bridges with messages for
the new president,

31:10.268 --> 31:13.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among them, to build bridges,
not walls.

31:13.171 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tokyo, hundreds of people,
most of them
women, marched in the night
streets in protest

31:18.443 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Mr. Trump's presidency.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeff joins me
now.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's still in downtown
Washington.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeff, you have been there all
day.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do things stand right now?

31:27.953 --> 31:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I mean, you
can hear
all around me sirens in one
corner, a band

31:34.392 --> 31:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playing in another corner,
police off right
behind me.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a very unusual day
here, Judy, in
Washington.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is an extremely unusual
evening.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's calmer right now than it
was.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm standing actually right at
the spot.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're right outside The
Washington Post.

31:50.075 --> 31:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where that limousine,
that car was
set on fire that you showed the
-- our audience

31:54.513 --> 31:56.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the video of from a little
earlier.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a little calmer now.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a very large security
presence now.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is more protesters down at
the other
end.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, I see some flames
right there,
but I don't think that's a major
fire at the

32:07.459 --> 32:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moment, but we will watch that.

32:09.261 --> 32:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a little calmer, but -- and
we have been
told that, for most part, at
least the main

32:14.533 --> 32:20.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
coalition groups are not
planning any more
activities tonight, but maybe
these smaller

32:20.138 --> 32:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups that caused more of the
trouble.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thinking really is that
it is these
smaller groups that have caused
most of the

32:26.144 --> 32:27.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trouble.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't quite know what's
going to happen
with them later on, but, for the
most part,

32:30.615 --> 32:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we may have seen -- it's
a little
calmer now.

32:33.151 --> 32:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In just a few
seconds, Jeff,
we saw you talking to some of
the protesters.

32:37.222 --> 32:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you get the sense that they
feel their
message is being heard?

32:40.826 --> 32:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Judy, I
think it's more
about -- and I was listening to
the conversation

32:45.130 --> 32:46.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you were just having.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's more about what's
next.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, where do they go from
here?

32:49.901 --> 32:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted to make sure that
they were here,
that they were showing that they
exist, that

32:54.005 --> 32:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have a message, and that
they can press
things ahead.

32:56.641 --> 33:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was about meeting people
and speaking
up and sort of organizing to see
where they

33:02.280 --> 33:04.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go from here.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that, of course --
just as you
were saying with the guests
earlier, that's

33:06.751 --> 33:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really the big question for the
people on
the streets as well: What's
next?

33:10.021 --> 33:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeffrey Brown out
on the streets
all day long for the "NewsHour,"
thank you.

33:14.926 --> 33:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All day, Judy.

33:15.927 --> 33:16.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:16.928 --> 33:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really fine
reporting.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

33:19.631 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Thanks.

33:25.203 --> 33:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, since the
November election,
there has been a lot of talk
about how well

33:34.346 --> 33:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump connected with those
voters who
felt ignored or looked down upon
by politicians.

33:40.218 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, they had their moment to
be heard.

33:43.121 --> 33:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins was on the
Mall to listen
to what some Trump supporters
had to say.

33:47.893 --> 33:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They came from
across the
country, many at their first
inauguration,

33:53.331 --> 33:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a gray day that didn't dampen
their excitement
and hope.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marion Carpenter and Larry
Sanders drove up
from South Carolina yesterday.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We intend to follow him all
the way.

34:03.241 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They traveled
here with their
church group, they said,
because, before Trump,

34:07.612 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they'd seen their way of life
disappearing.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARION CARPENTER, Trump
Supporter: The steel
mills are gone.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The coal industry is gone.

34:13.818 --> 34:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People are hurting for jobs

34:15.553 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The crowd
didn't reach as
far down the National Mall as at
President

34:19.324 --> 34:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama's inaugurations, but it
was a devoted
group.

34:22.994 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joseph Zadeh's from Ohio hit on
a theme for
many Trump supporters, that
seeing President

34:29.367 --> 34:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump take office eased years of
personal
frustration.

34:32.537 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH ZADEH, Trump Supporter: I
started being
interested in politics midway
through Obama's

34:36.574 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
second term.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's like, as a Republican,
it's being
told, oh, your ideas are stupid.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, finally, look, we're here.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're making America great
again.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARILYN BYERS, Trump Supporter:
I'm a Marine
mom.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's a Navy mom.

34:47.385 --> 34:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Kelly Haisley
and Marilyn
Byers are from Indiana, friends
since high

34:52.557 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

34:53.558 --> 34:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They drove nine hours to be
here.

34:55.493 --> 34:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To them, Mr. Trump represents a
change in
national priorities.

34:58.763 --> 35:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARILYN BYERS: It's been a real
disappointment
for eight years, and it's time
that we get

35:03.668 --> 35:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to grassroots and family
values.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to make America...

35:08.840 --> 35:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY HAISLEY, Trump Supporter:
Appreciating
our military.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARILYN BYERS: Amen.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY HAISLEY: I just don't feel
our troops
have been supported, and looking
forward to

35:14.612 --> 35:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them having a president and
commander in chief
that's going to do that for them
that loves

35:18.316 --> 35:20.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America,

35:20.051 --> 35:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Here, too, were
some from
a Democratic base, unions, like
ironworker

35:24.189 --> 35:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Dwyer, who fought back pain
to make it
here.

35:27.826 --> 35:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a New Yorker, like Mr.
Trump, and doesn't
trust politicians.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM DWYER, Trump Supporter: He's
a man of
his word.

35:33.431 --> 35:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe -- like I said, I grew
up in New
York, in Queens.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's just part of the
woodwork of New
York.

35:40.872 --> 35:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, when he says he's going to
do something,
I believe that he's going to do
it, and he's

35:46.244 --> 35:48.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to make it shine.

35:48.113 --> 35:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Most came for
Mr. Trump,
but many, like these Delaware
middle schoolers,

35:52.083 --> 35:56.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
came just to witness the
peaceful transfer
of power itself.

35:56.388 --> 36:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of their parents admitted
they didn't
support the new president, but
told us their

36:00.825 --> 36:02.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trip was about more.

36:02.527 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" from the
National Mall
in Washington, I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

36:06.898 --> 36:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in addition
to the protests
today, there are plans for much
more to come

36:12.804 --> 36:14.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

36:14.773 --> 36:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women from around the country
are making their
way to the nation's capital,
with others preparing

36:18.676 --> 36:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for events in cities around the
globe.

36:21.346 --> 36:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crowds on the National Mall
on Saturday
are expected to be in the
hundreds of thousands.

36:27.318 --> 36:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham recently sat
down at the
Newseum with two organizers of
tomorrow's

36:32.123 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
march, Bob Bland and Carmen
Perez.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William began by asking what
they hope to
accomplish.

36:37.829 --> 36:45.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BLAND, Co-Chair, Women's
March on Washington:
We are bringing together women,
men and allies

36:45.036 --> 36:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from all different types of
communities from
all over the country to say that
we're standing

36:50.308 --> 36:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in solidarity together to say
that women's
rights are human rights.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ, Co-Chair, Women's
March on Washington:
We are coming here so that we
could show this

36:58.550 --> 37:01.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new administration that we're
not going anywhere,
right?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are so many more of us
that are
actually united than we are
divided.

37:05.023 --> 37:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This March on Washington is to
ensure that
Congress, our new president and
the Senate

37:10.128 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know that we're going to
continue to fight
for our rights, that we're going
to protect

37:13.198 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most marginalized
communities.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What are you
marching for,
and what are you marching
against?

37:17.502 --> 37:22.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARMEN PEREZ: So, we are
marching to continue
to allow women to make decisions
about their

37:22.807 --> 37:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bodies and ensure we have
reproductive justice
rights, immigration reform,
criminal justice

37:29.147 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reform, as well as indigenous
rights.

37:31.616 --> 37:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there are so many things.

37:33.651 --> 37:39.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have been extremely
intentional about allowing
organizations to get involved,
Planned Parenthood,

37:39.357 --> 37:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well as Define American.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB BLAND: And every woman has
their own reason
for marching.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's the really beautiful
thing about
this.

37:47.699 --> 37:52.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen, through the last
18 months and
everything that's happened, that
we can be

37:52.737 --> 37:54.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
complacent no longer.

37:54.572 --> 37:57.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There are so
many specifics
in your guiding principles,
everything from

37:57.909 --> 38:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minimum wage, to reproductive
rights, to environmental
concerns, to indigenous people's
concerns.

38:04.582 --> 38:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why was it important to you to
be so specific
in the things that you're
marching for?

38:09.487 --> 38:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: We wanted to make
sure that
there was a mission, there was a
vision, that

38:12.457 --> 38:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we started organizing for
something, not against
something, right?

38:15.393 --> 38:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is not a march against
Trump.

38:17.896 --> 38:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a march on Washington,
Congress, the
Senate, our president.

38:21.699 --> 38:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I hear what
you're saying,
that this is not against Trump,
but the timing

38:26.304 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of it couldn't be more obvious.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there something about his
administration
that you guys are particularly
concerned about?

38:31.809 --> 38:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BLAND: Well, we saw an
increase in this
country in instances of bigotry
and racism,

38:39.817 --> 38:42.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anti-Semitism, misogyny.

38:42.453 --> 38:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of this came to the
forefront and these
conversations came to the
forefront during

38:47.592 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the election cycle.

38:49.494 --> 38:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of the
guiding principles
that you have laid out seem to
really place

38:52.597 --> 38:58.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a lot of emphasis on the
concerns of women
of color, immigrant women.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was that intentional?

39:00.004 --> 39:05.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARMEN PEREZ: It was
intentional, especially
because our new president-elect
was attacking

39:05.510 --> 39:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of these communities with
his -- some
of his racist rhetoric around
Mexicans and

39:10.515 --> 39:11.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
building a wall.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm Mexican-American myself.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Linda Sarsour, one of our
national co-chairs,
is Muslim American.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to have courageous
conversations.

39:18.690 --> 39:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we -- we don't speak
about religion
and politics and race because we
don't want

39:23.828 --> 39:25.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to offend anyone.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But how are we going to learn?

39:26.464 --> 39:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's hard to
talk about
these things.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: Right, exactly.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's what this march has
been able to
do, is to create a very safe
space and an

39:32.470 --> 39:37.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honest space, where we could
have these difficult
-- quote, unquote --
"courageous" conversations,

39:37.041 --> 39:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that we can move forward
together as a
country.

39:39.944 --> 39:45.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What would you
say to a
young woman of color who has
heard about what

39:45.083 --> 39:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they might see at a feminist
march or a feminist
action in the past, and felt
excluded from

39:50.521 --> 39:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, and they think, I'm not
going to do
this?

39:52.657 --> 39:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: What I would say
to a young
woman of color who doesn't feel
like this

39:56.628 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
march or even feminism has ever
been for them,
I would say, we need you.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BOB BLAND: Yes.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: We welcome you.

40:04.002 --> 40:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's many moments where I
never saw somebody
like myself reflected in
leadership.

40:07.171 --> 40:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why I have taken that
role now.

40:10.041 --> 40:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is there any
concern that,
because this march is happening
the day after

40:15.046 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump becomes president, and is
clearly targeted
in some ways at the Trump
administration,

40:20.551 --> 40:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you might alienate a part
of the country
who may have supported Trump or
may have been

40:25.623 --> 40:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Republican, or that you might
end up driving
people away because this is seen
as a partisan

40:32.864 --> 40:34.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day?

40:34.632 --> 40:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: I will say, we
welcome everybody
who actually supports women's
rights.

40:39.837 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if you are Republican,
if you are
a Democrat, if you are Green
Party, whatever

40:43.975 --> 40:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party you are, we welcome you to
be a part
of this.

40:46.878 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I believe that there are
many women
who voted for Trump who are also
coming, and

40:53.217 --> 40:54.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

40:54.218 --> 40:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You think
that's right?

40:56.020 --> 40:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You think you're going to have
women who support
Trump that will be here on
Saturday?

40:57.922 --> 41:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARMEN PEREZ: I believe, you
know, that people
who feel connected to women's
rights are going

41:02.660 --> 41:04.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be there.

41:04.462 --> 41:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BLAND: And I think that
there are many,
many conservative women who
didn't vote for

41:09.033 --> 41:10.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

41:10.802 --> 41:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have been e-mailing us
and saying,
yes, we want to stand in
solidarity against

41:15.873 --> 41:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
misogyny and for our rights as
women.

41:19.010 --> 41:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's a moment
where we can
look at, what does it mean to be
conservative,

41:25.183 --> 41:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you Republican or are you
Democrat, and
that's it.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we're all people first.

41:30.188 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How will you
measure whether
or not Saturday is a success?

41:33.758 --> 41:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BLAND: For us, this impact
will be something
that reverberates across the
country and across

41:40.331 --> 41:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the world for quite a while.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, you know, we will see
what the long-term
impact of it is.

41:47.872 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think that's also up to
the marchers.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's up to them to take
their power
and use it.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARMEN PEREZ: I agree.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
Donald Trump
will be watching?

41:57.215 --> 42:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB BLAND: I think he will be
tweeting.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:02.286 --> 42:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Bob
Bland, Carmen
Perez, thank you both very much.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BOB BLAND: Thanks.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARMEN PEREZ: Thank you.

42:15.733 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new president
is already
weighing in on some policy
matters.

42:21.272 --> 42:26.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Within minutes of the
swearing-in today, the
White House Web site carried new
statements.

42:26.444 --> 42:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One promised a -- quote --
"state-of-the-art
missile defense system to
protect against

42:30.915 --> 42:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks from states like Iran
and North Korea."

42:34.886 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another condemned what it called
the "dangerous
anti-police atmosphere in
America," and promised

42:40.691 --> 42:42.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it will end.

42:42.160 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the Web site
dropped all
mention of climate change.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The inauguration also
reverberated around
the world.

42:49.534 --> 42:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moscow, Russians welcomed the
new president
with posters, special sales and
parties, anticipating

42:56.240 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better relations with the U.S.

42:58.509 --> 43:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a statement, Pope Francis
urged President
Trump to -- quote -- "be guided
by the rich

43:03.815 --> 43:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spiritual values that have
shaped the history
of the American people,"
especially, he said,

43:09.887 --> 43:11.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
concern for the poor.

43:11.689 --> 43:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate late
this afternoon
confirmed the first of Mr.
Trump's Cabinet

43:16.060 --> 43:17.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nominees.

43:17.562 --> 43:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Marine General James
Mattis was approved
as secretary of defense.

43:21.899 --> 43:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Kelly, another former
Marine general,
won confirmation to head the
Department of

43:26.971 --> 43:29.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Homeland Security.

43:29.040 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Mexican drug lord "El Chapo"
Guzman pleaded
not guilty today in New York to
federal drug

43:35.413 --> 43:37.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trafficking charges.

43:37.081 --> 43:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was extradited yesterday from
Mexico, after
twice escaping from prison
there.

43:42.887 --> 43:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn
said today
that it's time he faced justice.

43:46.858 --> 43:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CAPERS, U.S. Attorney:
Guzman's destructive
and murderous rise as an
international narcotics

43:52.063 --> 43:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trafficker is akin to that of a
small, cancerous
tumor that metastasized, and
grew into a full-blown

43:58.936 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scourge that, for decades,
littered the streets
of Mexico with the casualties of
violent drug

44:05.309 --> 44:06.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wars over turf.

44:06.944 --> 44:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the same scourge helped to
perpetrate
the drug epidemic here in the
U.S.

44:11.849 --> 44:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mexican officials
said the
timing of the extradition was
not related

44:16.220 --> 44:19.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the inauguration of President
Trump.

44:19.123 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Central Italy, a dramatic
scene played
out, as rescue crews found 10
people alive

44:25.463 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a resort hotel crushed by an
avalanche.

44:28.499 --> 44:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are among some 30 people
thought to be
trapped after the massive
snowslide on Wednesday.

44:34.572 --> 44:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Workers captured the moment
today that two
survivors were pulled from the
snow, one of

44:39.577 --> 44:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them a young boy amid cheers
from the crews.

44:42.547 --> 44:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCO BINI, Rescue Worker
(through translator):
They survived thanks to this
bubble of air

44:47.785 --> 44:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that formed inside the hotel.

44:49.887 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finding them was really tough,
because not
only were we working in the
middle of the

44:53.558 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debris, but we also had snow to
deal with.

44:55.726 --> 44:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like an earthquake in the
snow.

44:57.628 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's hard to describe.

44:58.729 --> 45:00.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something unbelievable.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's awful.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, the crews
have also
found four bodies.

45:05.336 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word that the defeated
president
of Gambia has agreed to step
aside, apparently

45:10.241 --> 45:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ending a political crisis.

45:12.577 --> 45:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials in neighboring Senegal
say final
arrangements are still being
worked out.

45:17.181 --> 45:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senegal and other West African
states had
sent in troops to force Yahya
Jammeh to give

45:22.653 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

45:24.422 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man who beat him in last
month's election,
Adama Barrow, says what he terms
Jammeh's

45:28.459 --> 45:30.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rule of fear is over.

45:30.695 --> 45:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In economic news, China's growth
last year
was the slowest since 1990.

45:36.467 --> 45:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beijing reported today that the
growth rate
ran at 6.7 percent.

45:40.638 --> 45:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average broke a five-day losing
streak, and

45:45.910 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gained nearly 95 points today to
close at
19827.

45:51.148 --> 45:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 15, and the S&amp;P
500 added
seven.

45:55.753 --> 46:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is up 6 percent since the
election.

46:05.863 --> 46:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is up 6 percent since the
election.

46:11.102 --> 46:15.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: As former
President Obama
now embarks on life after the
White House,

46:15.840 --> 46:22.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
flying to California for
vacation, few people
had as intimate a view of him as
the man tasked

46:22.279 --> 46:24.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with taking his picture.

46:24.382 --> 46:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang is back with that
story.

46:27.551 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For the past eight
years, Pete
Souza has watched history
through the viewfinder

46:37.061 --> 46:38.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of his camera.

46:38.863 --> 46:40.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETE SOUZA, Former Chief
Official White House
Photographer: To walk into the
Oval Office

46:40.665 --> 46:46.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every day, to walk along the
Colonnade to
photograph this man every day
has just been

46:46.871 --> 46:48.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a unique experience.

46:48.873 --> 46:53.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He was behind the
scenes for world-changing
events, like the May afternoon
in 2011 when

46:53.611 --> 46:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. special forces killed Osama
bin Laden.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: This was in the
Situation Room.

47:00.651 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see in the faces how
tense this was
to watch.

47:05.222 --> 47:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing to me is,
you can see
the brigadier general that is
sitting in what

47:10.227 --> 47:13.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be considered the
president's chair.

47:13.631 --> 47:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he stood up to give the
president his
chair.

47:16.167 --> 47:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president's like, "No,
no, no, you
stay where you're at, because
you're in control

47:21.872 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

47:22.873 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will just pull up a
chair."

47:24.709 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There were days of
sadness, like
preparing for the 2012 prayer
service for

47:29.213 --> 47:32.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the young victims of the
Newtown, Connecticut,
school shooting.

47:32.950 --> 47:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It meant President Obama would
miss his own
daughter's dance recital.

47:36.721 --> 47:39.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, he went to her dress
rehearsal.

47:39.457 --> 47:45.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PETE SOUZA: Sasha's
participation was, I think,
in three of the 16 performances.

47:45.696 --> 47:52.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when she was dancing, he was
totally focused
on watching her.

47:52.570 --> 47:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when she left the
stage and other
people were dancing, he was
editing his speech.

47:57.675 --> 48:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see just the -- that
little subtle
look on his face.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's still very emotional.

48:04.415 --> 48:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Emotions that would
touch Souza
as well.

48:08.519 --> 48:12.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: Newtown was the one
time where
I had tears.

48:12.857 --> 48:18.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was very difficult to watch
him greet these
families.

48:18.295 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just imagine all of them meeting
the president
for the first time in the worst
of circumstances.

48:25.469 --> 48:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say that was the one
time where,
emotionally, I couldn't hide how
I was feeling.

48:31.575 --> 48:37.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And you're not just
capturing the
moments of history, the big
moments of the

48:37.982 --> 48:39.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

48:39.116 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're capturing the small,
human moments
as well.

48:41.886 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: And, to me, those
are my -- probably
my favorite moments is little
unexpected gems,

48:49.794 --> 48:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as I call them, that happen on
occasion.

48:52.062 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like this otherwise
routine Oval
Office meeting with a departing
staff member

48:56.634 --> 48:58.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and his family.

48:58.435 --> 49:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: The man's son Jacob
asked the
president if he could feel his
head, because

49:03.841 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his friends had told him that he
had the exact
same haircut as the president.

49:08.112 --> 49:13.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, President Obama just kind of
leaned down,
and Jacob feels his head, and
click.

49:13.384 --> 49:18.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, this had kind of
taken on
somewhat of an iconic status,
just because

49:18.222 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it showed the kind of person he
is, meaning
President Obama.

49:22.326 --> 49:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Did you have any
sense that it
would because so iconic, so
symbolic?

49:26.330 --> 49:28.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: Absolutely not.

49:28.499 --> 49:30.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:30.534 --> 49:36.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: Even after we posted
it on WhiteHouse.gov,
I just didn't realize how
significant it would

49:37.007 --> 49:38.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
become.

49:38.709 --> 49:42.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's one of many
images Souza has
captured of Mr. Obama with
children.

49:42.680 --> 49:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: I feel the joy and
the disbelief
that the president of the United
States is

49:47.551 --> 49:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lying on the rug of the Oval
Office, hoisting
up a little girl in her elephant
costume.

49:53.557 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's that picture of him
flexing muscles
with Superman, or getting zapped
by Spider-Man.

49:59.730 --> 50:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Were you surprised
when he sort
of flies back when Spider-Man
slings the web?

50:05.102 --> 50:06.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETE SOUZA: Sure.

50:06.103 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it's, like, completely
unexpected.

50:08.606 --> 50:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I always tell people that
the only pressure
of my job is to make sure I'm
ready for those

50:13.911 --> 50:16.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moments, and try not to mess
them up.

50:16.547 --> 50:22.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After two terms, the
president
jokes about his graying hair,
but Souza says

50:22.720 --> 50:26.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the man he sees through his
camera lens has
been constant.

50:27.024 --> 50:33.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE SOUZA: You know, I have got
to say that
the core character of this man
has not changed

50:33.564 --> 50:35.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one iota.

50:35.332 --> 50:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think he's still the
same person
he was that I met in January of
2005, when

50:44.174 --> 50:48.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was first elected to the
Senate.

50:48.379 --> 50:49.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has he gotten older?

50:49.713 --> 50:54.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, sure, but this is what
happens, not
just to a president.

50:54.585 --> 51:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in terms of, like, his
character, I honestly
don't think he has changed at
all.

51:01.392 --> 51:06.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: For the "PBS
