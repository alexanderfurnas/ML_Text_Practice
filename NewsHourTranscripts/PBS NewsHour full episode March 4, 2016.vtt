JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.175 --> 00:10.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
He's trying to do to the
American voter what

00:10.444 --> 00:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he did to the people that signed
up for this
course. He's making promises he
has no intention

00:15.249 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of keeping.

00:17.251 --> 00:21.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
presidential front-runner
Donald Trump gets hit hard for
Trump University

00:21.688 --> 00:24.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and more at last night's
Republican debate.

00:24.791 --> 00:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, a dangerous trend: What
happens when
the only hospital in a remote
town is shut

00:30.898 --> 00:32.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down?

00:32.833 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CHAVIS, Georgia: And the
whole time,
I'm driving to town with the
palms of my hands,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where I burnt my hands. I said,
where do I
go? Where do I go?

00:40.707 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze the week's

00:45.178 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:46.246 --> 00:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.919 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.987 --> 01:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fur kept
flying today,
in the raucous Republican
presidential race.

01:06.833 --> 01:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump and his rivals were
back on the
road hours after their debate in
Detroit.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
So how many of you all watched
the debate

01:14.574 --> 01:15.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night?

01:15.342 --> 01:16.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:16.944 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: We had some
fireworks on stage.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm not here to attack anyone.
We did plenty

01:23.250 --> 01:24.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of that last night, I suppose.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When I'm on a debate stage and,
I have all

01:26.687 --> 01:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these people throwing things at
me, you have
got to fight back.

01:29.089 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fallout from the
GOP's full-on
civil war still in the air at
today's campaign

01:35.562 --> 01:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
events. The rhetoric last night
ranged from
personal slights.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Host, "FOX News
Sunday": I
have a policy question for you,
sir.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Let's see if
he answers
it.

01:43.303 --> 01:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will. Don't
worry about it,
Marco. Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about

01:48.108 --> 01:49.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, little Marco. I will.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: All right,
well, let's hear
it, big Donald.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To downright
vulgarity.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Look at those
hands. Are they
small hands?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:57.117 --> 02:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And he referred to
my hands,
if they are small, something
else must be

02:01.621 --> 02:04.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small. I guarantee you there is
no problem.
I guarantee you.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:06.626 --> 02:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump was
the overwhelming
focus, with rivals Ted Cruz and
Marco Rubio

02:10.897 --> 02:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a furious mission to slow his
march to
the nomination.

02:14.768 --> 02:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At times, they tag-teamed, as on
the Trump
University real estate seminars,
now the subject

02:21.241 --> 02:23.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of lawsuits claiming fraud.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: He's trying to
con people
into giving him their vote, just
like he conned

02:26.847 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these people.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ: And if we
nominate Donald,
we're going to spend the spring,
the fall

02:31.485 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the summer with the
Republican nominee
facing a fraud trial...

02:36.356 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, stop it.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: ... with Hillary
Clinton saying...

02:38.825 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's just a minor
case. It's
a minor case.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: ... why did you
give my campaign
and my foundation $100,000?

02:41.728 --> 02:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's a minor civil
case.

02:43.730 --> 02:50.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: FOX News
moderators Chris Wallace,
Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier also
pushed Trump

02:50.370 --> 02:54.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his changes of position, and
on the math
behind his proposals.

02:54.474 --> 03:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE: You say that
Medicare could
save $300 billion a year
negotiating lower

03:00.680 --> 03:08.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drug prices. But Medicare total
only spends
$78 billion a year on drugs.

03:08.288 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sir, that's the facts. You are
talking about
saving more money on Medicare
prescription

03:12.859 --> 03:14.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs...

03:14.828 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying saving
through negotiation
throughout the economy, you will
save $300

03:16.496 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
billion a year.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE: But that doesn't
really cut
the federal deficit.

03:19.833 --> 03:25.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And through it
all, Ohio Governor
John Kasich strove again to stay
above the

03:25.172 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fray.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
I have never tried to go and get
into these

03:29.176 --> 03:33.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scrums that we're seeing here on
the stage.
And people say everywhere I go,
you seem to

03:33.647 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the adult on the stage.

03:35.515 --> 03:40.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the end,
though, all four
candidates pledged to support
the GOP nominee,

03:40.921 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whomever that turns out to be.

03:43.056 --> 03:50.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Kasich and Cruz just
outside Washington
to address CPAC, the annual
meeting of conservative

03:50.130 --> 03:51.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activists.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KASICH: Bringing people
together works.

03:53.600 --> 03:58.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rubio is
scheduled to speak
there tomorrow. But Trump
announced he's skipping

03:58.872 --> 04:05.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his appearance to campaign in
Kansas instead.
Republicans have contests there
on Saturday,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in Kentucky, Louisiana and
Maine.

04:08.582 --> 04:14.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for the Democrats, Senator
Bernie Sanders
Edwardsville, Illinois, again
slammed Hillary

04:15.088 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton on trade policy.

04:17.224 --> 04:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Secretary Clinton supported
NAFTA. She supported

04:21.561 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permanent normal trade relations
with China.
Those agreements have cost us
millions of

04:27.467 --> 04:28.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jobs as a nation.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Detroit today,
Clinton fired
back.

04:31.338 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When it comes to trade deals,
here's my standard.

04:35.775 --> 04:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I won't support any agreement
unless it helps
create good jobs, at higher
wages for American

04:43.416 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers and protects our
national security.

04:46.653 --> 04:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two Democrats
have their
contests tomorrow in Kansas,
Louisiana and

04:52.726 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nebraska.

04:54.728 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, Republican
presidential candidate
Dr. Ben Carson made it official:
He suspended

05:00.200 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will return to the
presidential race, with
Mark Shields and David Brooks,
later in the

05:05.405 --> 05:07.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. economy
has turned in another strong
month, despite

05:11.011 --> 05:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a global economic slowdown. The
Labor Department
reported that U.S. employers
added 242,000

05:18.451 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs in February, led by the
retail, restaurant
and health care sectors. The
unemployment

05:24.090 --> 05:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate held steady at 4.9 percent,
as more people
started looking for work.

05:29.896 --> 05:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House, President
Obama met with
his economic advisers and said
the numbers

05:34.134 --> 05:36.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prove his detractors wrong.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
There seems to be an alternative
reality out

05:39.005 --> 05:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there from the -- some of the
political folks
that America is down in the
dumps. It's not.

05:50.817 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America is pretty darn great
right now, and
making strides right now, and
small businesses

05:57.190 --> 06:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and large businesses alike are
hiring right
now.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Continued low
unemployment
may also open the door to the
Federal Reserve

06:05.665 --> 06:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raising interest rates again in
June.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Slowing growth in China is
taking a bite out
of military spending. Beijing
announced today

06:13.974 --> 06:19.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that its defense budget will
increase this
year by 7 to 8 percent. That is
the slowest

06:19.646 --> 06:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pace in six years. Since 2000,
China has mostly
hiked military spending by
double digits.

06:26.753 --> 06:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, rebel groups charged
today that
government forces are still
attacking just

06:32.058 --> 06:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a day after the U.N. voiced
optimism about
a week-old cease-fire. Activists
reported

06:37.731 --> 06:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warplanes hit a rebel-held town
near the capital,
Damascus, for the first time
since fighting

06:43.803 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was supposed to stop. Syrian
peace talks are
due to resume in Geneva next
Wednesday.

06:50.677 --> 06:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A court in Turkey has sentenced
two Syrian
smugglers to four years in
prison in the death

06:56.549 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a 3-year-old boy. The child's
body washed
up on a beach last September,
and the images

07:02.589 --> 07:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sparked international outrage.
Today, the
court in Ankara convicted the
two men on smuggling

07:08.528 --> 07:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges, but it found them not
guilty of causing
the boy's death. The defense
blamed his father,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who has since returned to Syria.

07:17.971 --> 07:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a flurry
in the O.J.
Simpson murder case more than 20
years after

07:23.576 --> 07:29.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was acquitted. Los Angeles
police confirmed
today that they're investigating
a knife purportedly

07:29.883 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found at the site of Simpson's
former home.
They say someone spotted the
knife apparently

07:35.221 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the home was torn down in
the late '90s
and gave it to a now-retired
police officer.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he failed to turn it in
until recently.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAPT. ANDREW NEIMAN, Los Angeles
Police Department:
I don't know what the
circumstances are, why

07:46.333 --> 07:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that didn't happen, or if that's
entirely
accurate, or if this whole story
is possibly

07:52.539 --> 07:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bogus from the get-go, involving
a variety
of people. So, we're looking
into that. But

07:56.976 --> 07:58.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was quite shocked.

07:58.878 --> 08:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: NBC News reported
later that
the knife is inconsistent with
other evidence,

08:04.150 --> 08:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it is likely that double
jeopardy would
bar another murder trial for
Simpson, regardless.

08:09.756 --> 08:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was acquitted in 1995 of
stabbing to death
his ex-wife, Nicole, and her
friend Ron Goldman.

08:16.363 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is now serving prison time in
Nevada for
armed robbery and kidnapping in
a separate

08:21.935 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And today's positive jobs
numbers helped pushed
Wall Street higher to finish out
the week

08:27.640 --> 08:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with modest gains. The Dow Jones
industrial
average was up nearly 63 points
to close back

08:33.613 --> 08:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above 17000. The Nasdaq rose
nine points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added six. For
the week, the

08:40.653 --> 08:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dow was up 2 percent. The Nasdaq
and the S&amp;P
increased well over 2.5 percent.

08:46.359 --> 08:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Brazil in
dire straits, the Zika virus,
corruption,

08:53.199 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Olympic woes; European
leaders' tough
message for economic migrants;
the cost of

08:59.806 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closing hospitals in rural
America; and much
more.

09:15.021 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nation of Brazil was already
reeling from
economic woes and the onset of
the Zika virus,

09:21.094 --> 09:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when, this morning, a popular
former president
was detained in a wide-ranging
corruption

09:27.133 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
probe.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to Hari Sreenivasan for
more.

09:29.903 --> 09:34.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva
was the wildly popular president
of Brazil

09:34.407 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from 2003 to 2010.

09:37.143 --> 09:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this morning, Lula, as he's
known, was
brought to a police station in
Sao Paulo for

09:41.481 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioning by officials, while
a large crowd
of his supporters formed
outside. Lula was

09:46.886 --> 09:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioned as part of a major
political corruption
scandal involving the country's
gigantic state

09:51.925 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oil company, Petrobras.

09:54.093 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this comes as the country
faces the threat
from the Zika virus, a damaging
recession

09:59.499 --> 10:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and hosting duties for the
Summer Olympics.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined from Rio by Simon
Romero of The
New York Times.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just to get our audience up
to speed,
what's this investigation all
about?

10:08.741 --> 10:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO, The New York
Times: Well, it's
a sprawling inquiry into the
bribery and kickbacks

10:15.014 --> 10:20.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that took place around
Petrobras, which is
company of incredible importance
to the Brazilian

10:21.054 --> 10:22.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

10:22.989 --> 10:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made Brazil's huge offshore
oil discoveries
about a decade ago and really
contributed

10:28.328 --> 10:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Brazil's rise as a developing
world powerhouse,
but it turns out that
politicians and executives

10:34.801 --> 10:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at huge construction companies
and contractors
were looting the company for
years, creating

10:41.307 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this vast scheme of hundreds of
millions of
dollars of bribes.

10:45.278 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now it's engulfing one of
the country's
most towering political figures,
who is Lula.

10:50.783 --> 10:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it the
quantity of money
being that was pushed off the
books? Because,

10:57.757 --> 11:01.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately, corruption is a
reality in
lots of parts of the world.
Brazil is not

11:01.494 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immune to it before. So why is
this one such
a big deal?

11:05.298 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: In some cases,
yes, it does
have to do with the quantity of
money. One

11:09.802 --> 11:16.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
executive at Petrobras, a
relatively obscure,
mid-level manager, managed to
take almost

11:16.809 --> 11:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$100 million in bribes himself,
and he's had
to give back almost all of that
money as part

11:22.615 --> 11:24.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a plea deal.

11:24.517 --> 11:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the amounts involved are
just astonishing.
So, even in a country like
Brazil, which had

11:29.956 --> 11:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been hardened in a sense to
stories of corruption
throughout various levels of
government, the

11:35.261 --> 11:38.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Petrobras scandal has just been
astonishing
for many people.

11:38.865 --> 11:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Put this in
economic context
for us. What's happening to the
economy now

11:43.403 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and why are people paying more
attention to
this scandal?

11:46.172 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: Well, the memories
of Brazil's
incredible boom of the previous
decade, when,

11:52.979 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the country really
emerged on the
global stage and won its bids to
host the

11:58.384 --> 12:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olympic Games and the World Cup,
are really
a thing of the past.

12:03.189 --> 12:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The figures which were released
just this
week show that the economy
shrank 3.8 percent

12:08.895 --> 12:15.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in 2015. That's the worst
economic plunge
in 25 years, and some economists
are claiming

12:15.134 --> 12:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's going to be the worst
and most severe
recession in the country in
nearly a century.

12:19.839 --> 12:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's just a huge dilemma that
the country's
leaders are now facing, and in
part it's one

12:25.645 --> 12:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their own making. You know,
they put into
motion these policies which are
creating the

12:31.117 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crisis they're experiencing
today.

12:33.119 --> 12:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is also
happening at
a time when everyone around the
world is concerned

12:37.724 --> 12:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Brazil because of the Zika
virus.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: That's right.

12:41.661 --> 12:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The epidemic around the virus is
yet another
blow to Brazil at a very
delicate time for

12:48.167 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. It's been spreading
very quickly
throughout Northeast Brazil, a
poverty-stricken

12:52.271 --> 12:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
region, and now you're finding
more and more
cases of birth defects which are
linked to

12:57.310 --> 13:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zika here in the big cities, in
the southeast,
more industrialized part of the
country here

13:01.948 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Rio and Sao Paulo.

13:03.916 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's also
having a ripple
effect on the Olympic Games,
which are going

13:07.420 --> 13:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to start in a few months. There
are Olympic
teams around the world wondering
whether or

13:13.393 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not that they should bring their
athletes
to Brazil, and ticket sales are
down a lot

13:19.165 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than they were projected.

13:21.067 --> 13:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: It's been yet
another disappointment
in Brazil's preparations for the
Games.

13:26.439 --> 13:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're already dealing with a
polluted bay
here in Rio where the sailing
competition

13:31.611 --> 13:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will take place, and Zika is
presenting a
dilemma to the athletes who are
going to compete

13:37.750 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Rio and to many of the fans
who are going
to consider coming.

13:41.688 --> 13:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CDC in the United States
just issued a
warning advising pregnant women
about coming

13:48.127 --> 13:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Rio at this time, so the
risks are very
clear to a lot of people.

13:51.698 --> 13:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Simon Romero
of The New
York Times joining us from Rio
via Skype,

13:55.368 --> 13:56.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

13:57.003 --> 14:07.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: Thank you for
having me.

14:07.680 --> 14:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the refugee
crisis overwhelming Europe.

14:14.420 --> 14:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New border restrictions have
left more than
10,000 migrants stranded at the
crossing between

14:19.625 --> 14:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece and Macedonia. Food and
supplies are
running low, and conditions
worsened with

14:24.931 --> 14:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an overnight downpour.

14:26.833 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The backup also stretches south,
to Athens,
where hundreds spent another day
in an open

14:32.772 --> 14:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
square. European Union and
Turkish leaders
will discuss the crisis at a
summit on Monday.

14:39.045 --> 14:44.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by David
O'Sullivan. He's the
E.U.'s ambassador to the United
States.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Ambassador, welcome back to
the program.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN, European Union
Ambassador
to the United States: Thank you
very much.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From where we sit
in the United
States, this migrant crisis
looks like it's

14:50.957 --> 14:54.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gone from a disaster to a
catastrophe. How
do you see it?

14:54.894 --> 14:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Well, this is
the greatest
refugee crisis we have faced
since the Second

14:59.499 --> 15:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World War. And, of course, it's
a global crisis,
not just a crisis facing Europe.

15:04.237 --> 15:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The neighboring countries of
Syria have suffered
hugely, large numbers of
migrants in Lebanon,

15:10.710 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jordan and, of course, Turkey.
And, of course,
the European Union has seen an
unprecedented

15:15.181 --> 15:20.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
increase in the number of
refugees and asylum
seekers, 1.25 million last year
alone, which

15:20.887 --> 15:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is double from the previous
year.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this has certainly put our
systems and
our structures under strain. I
think there

15:26.692 --> 15:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a huge outpouring of
compassion and
good will by European citizens,
but the fact

15:31.164 --> 15:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is our systems are straining
under the pressure
of the outflows. And we have
been struggling

15:36.736 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last few weeks to find
a comprehensive
solution.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Tusk has been touring
the region
of the Balkans.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's the head of
the European
Council.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: President of
the European
Council.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has been touring in the
Balkans and
meeting, as you just ISIS , with
the Turkish

15:49.749 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders. And he has just issued
a letter ahead
of the very important meeting
which will take

15:54.287 --> 15:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place on Monday, which is not
only with Turkey,
but also a further meeting of
the European

15:58.057 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Council, indicating that he
thinks there is
a growing consensus emerging as
to how we

16:02.762 --> 16:05.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
can find a comprehensive
solution to this
humanitarian tragedy.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how would
that work?

16:07.800 --> 16:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Well, it's a
solution which
necessarily has many parts.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, of course, we have
to try and
solve the problem in Syria,
which is at the

16:15.608 --> 16:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
origin of this. We have had the
cessation
of hostilities. We're very
grateful for what

16:18.878 --> 16:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States in particular
is doing in
trying to broker a political
settlement in

16:23.282 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need to assist the
neighboring countries,
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
We're the largest

16:29.589 --> 16:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
donor of humanitarian assistance
to those
countries. And we have just
reached a new

16:33.059 --> 16:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement to give Turkey an
additional three
billion euro in order to
facilitate their

16:38.164 --> 16:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
management of the refugees
within Turkey.

16:41.868 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, we're hoping that
Turkey will
limit the outflow of migrants
across the Aegean

16:47.673 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Greece, because Greece is,
as you have
said, clearly facing
unprecedented numbers

16:52.545 --> 16:54.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and straining to cope.

16:54.413 --> 16:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are working to help
Greece and the
other front-line states better
to manage the

16:58.618 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation. We have just agreed
additional
funds for humanitarian purposes
within the

17:03.222 --> 17:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European Union, which is an
unprecedented
step.

17:05.892 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we are also
looking at relocating
refugees and asylum-seekers from
the front-line

17:14.166 --> 17:18.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states to other parts of the
European Union
in order better to distribute
the burden of

17:18.671 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looking after these people.

17:20.606 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But as country
after country
is either closing or severely
tightening their

17:25.211 --> 17:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borders, doesn't that make it
much harder
to find a solution here?

17:28.948 --> 17:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Well, I think
we are seeing
the closure of a number of
frontiers or greater

17:35.354 --> 17:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restrictions, but the fact is,
we have managed
to set up now reception centers
in Greece,

17:42.194 --> 17:43.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Italy.

17:44.030 --> 17:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are starting the process of
relocating
people from those centers into
other parts

17:47.900 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the European Union. We hope
that these
closures or these restrictions
at frontiers

17:51.637 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are temporary and that they will
in due course
be removed once we get the
situation more

17:56.142 --> 17:58.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under control.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will, of course, need to
tighten our controls
at the external frontier, not to
close them,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not to turn away refugees...

18:03.683 --> 18:06.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: ... but just
to make sure
that the reception of refugees
takes place

18:06.419 --> 18:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a more orderly and structured
way.

18:08.387 --> 18:14.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we will have to
address the
issue of economic migrants, who
will probably

18:14.260 --> 18:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not be accepted as refugees, and
who will
then have to return to the
countries from

18:18.397 --> 18:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which they came in due course.

18:20.299 --> 18:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What proportion
of these migrants
we're watching stranded at the
border are

18:25.204 --> 18:30.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are genuinely fleeing
a war zone?
And how many or what percentage
or, as you

18:31.043 --> 18:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
describe them, are looking for
better economic
opportunity, and they come
from...

18:35.948 --> 18:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Difficult to
have very precise
numbers, but I would say the
majority are

18:40.086 --> 18:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indeed people fleeing from
conflict, whether
in Syria or in other parts of
the world.

18:45.191 --> 18:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also a substantial
minority who
clearly are trying to make their
way to Europe,

18:50.863 --> 18:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for understandable reasons of
trying to make
a better life, but not
necessarily fleeing

18:55.167 --> 19:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a conflict, and they would
probably not
qualify under international law
for refugee

19:00.773 --> 19:02.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
status or asylum.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this -- we
heard President
Francois Hollande of France say
a couple of

19:06.746 --> 19:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks that this crisis threatens
to break
up the European Union. Do you
think it's that

19:12.251 --> 19:18.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
close to dissolving this
organization, this
European Union?

19:18.190 --> 19:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: I don't think
the European
Union is going to dissolve
anytime soon.

19:21.961 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very robust commitment of
European
people to the integration we
have achieved

19:27.967 --> 19:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the single currency, to the
economic interests
and political values which bind
us together.

19:32.705 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is true, this crisis is
creating strains
and stresses between our member
states. And

19:38.677 --> 19:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to absolutely find a way
better to
manage the crisis in order avoid
that these

19:44.083 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strains become too severe.

19:46.018 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we hope will happen
at the meeting
Monday. It's a tedious process.
We have 28

19:51.824 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sovereign member states. We have
the Western
Balkans with Turkey trying to
get a coordinated

19:57.830 --> 20:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response through these different
interests.
Does take time, and sometimes
decision-making

20:02.401 --> 20:04.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Europe can be slow.

20:04.236 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do believe that we are
slowly moving
towards a new phase in the
crisis, where we

20:08.607 --> 20:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be able much better to
manage it from
Monday on.

20:11.110 --> 20:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David O'Sullivan,
the European
Union ambassador to the United
States, thank

20:15.281 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you very much for being with us.

20:20.786 --> 20:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks on the fierce
fight for the

20:35.367 --> 20:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican nomination; a New
York Times film
critic explains why criticism
boosts creativity;

20:42.608 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the man visiting all 59
national parks
in 59 weeks.

20:47.780 --> 20:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, rural communities
around the country
have experienced a wave of
hospital closures

20:54.353 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last five years, with
hundreds more
on shaky financial footing.

20:59.158 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many small towns, it all
adds up to hard
times that may soon get harder.

21:04.563 --> 21:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sarah Varney has our report from
Georgia.
The story was produced in
collaboration with

21:09.068 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our partner Kaiser Health News.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYBIL AMMONS, Stewart County,
Georgia, Coroner:
It's just sad. And the hospital,
oh, my goodness.

21:15.074 --> 21:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Sybil Ammons is a
fixture in
the town of Lumpkin, Georgia,
population 1,500.

21:21.247 --> 21:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, she was the director
of nursing
at the county's only hospital in
nearby Richland.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now she's the county coroner.

21:28.187 --> 21:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYBIL AMMONS: Our people built
this hospital,
our ancestors. The hospital,
when I ride by

21:32.858 --> 21:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, it just breaks my heart,
because my
mama worked over there before I
did. My sister

21:37.930 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was born over there.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just so sad, so sad.

21:42.468 --> 21:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The hospital
closed in 2013.
Since then, Ammons can count off
the local

21:47.806 --> 21:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residents she thinks have been
harmed or died
because they couldn't reach
medical care quickly

21:52.478 --> 21:54.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

21:54.380 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYBIL AMMONS: We have had a
stroke, several
heart attacks, several cardiac
problems. We

21:59.351 --> 22:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had traumas out on the
four-lane. I would
say at least 10 to 15 people
have had bad

22:05.724 --> 22:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcomes from the hospital
closing.

22:08.360 --> 22:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Two hundred miles
away in Folkston,
Georgia, near the Okefenokee
Swamp, Pam Renshaw

22:14.233 --> 22:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to bypass her town's closed
hospital when
she needed it most. After a day
of yard work,

22:20.239 --> 22:24.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Renshaw overturned her
four-wheeler, spilling
into a fire pit used to burn
trash.

22:25.077 --> 22:29.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her then-boyfriend, Billy
Chavis, pulled her
from the fire and patted down
the flames on

22:29.715 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her body with his bare hands.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM RENSHAW, Georgia: Whenever I
got in the
truck, my whole -- everything
right here just

22:35.054 --> 22:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fell in my lap. And I just
pulled it back
up, and I'm like, oh, my gosh.
It's bad, isn't

22:39.391 --> 22:41.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CHAVIS, Georgia: And I
said, yes, we
got to get you to a doctor. And
I seriously

22:43.762 --> 22:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought we was going to lose
her. And the
whole time, I'm driving to town
with the palms

22:48.067 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my hands, where I burnt my
hands. I said,
where do I go? Where do I go?

22:52.771 --> 22:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The hospital had
closed just
months before Renshaw's
accident, leaving

22:57.243 --> 23:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chavis scrambling. He first
tried the EMT
office. When he didn't find
anyone, he ran

23:02.481 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the police station and a
dispatcher summoned
an ambulance.

23:06.151 --> 23:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Renshaw was airlifted to a
hospital in Gainesville,
Florida, 100 miles away. It was
an hour-and-a-half

23:12.558 --> 23:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before doctors tended to her.

23:14.426 --> 23:20.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM RENSHAW: It burnt like 45
percent of my
body, the whole arm all the way
across my

23:20.132 --> 23:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stomach, and down the left leg
to my knee.

23:24.870 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Renshaw was in a
medically-induced
coma for three months and spent
nearly eight

23:29.241 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months in the hospital. Her body
remains terribly
scarred.

23:33.679 --> 23:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dangerous industrial jobs drive
the economy
in Folkston, and Renshaw's
accident spooked

23:38.384 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this small town of 5,000. Local
leaders are
still trying to reopen the
hospital.

23:43.689 --> 23:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 50 rural hospitals
across the country
have closed since 2010, and
hundreds more

23:49.662 --> 23:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are in fragile financial
condition. It's a
trend hastened by declining
revenues and a

23:54.600 --> 23:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restructuring of the health care
industry
that rewards scale and
connectivity, difficult

23:59.338 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goals for hospitals that are
small and remote.
As rural hospitals have closed
here in Georgia,

24:05.210 --> 24:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds of people have lost
their jobs. And
many small towns have been left
reeling.

24:10.549 --> 24:15.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Glenwood, Georgia, the
hospital has been
abandoned for more than a year.
Inside, antiquated

24:15.921 --> 24:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security cameras flicker between
images of
empty hallways and still-made
beds. In the

24:21.193 --> 24:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital laboratory, it's as if
the workers
simply got up one day and left.
Unplugged

24:25.831 --> 24:29.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refrigerators still hold vials
of blood.

24:29.234 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are signs of decay
outside, too. After
the hospital closed, the bank
and the town's

24:34.073 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only restaurant quickly followed
suit. Next
may be the nursing home.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOLANDA JEFFERSON, Georgia: We
have a 50-bed
facility, and we have 35
residents. That's

24:41.180 --> 24:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a threat to us. That's very
detrimental. If
we go any lower, we might have
to close. We

24:46.685 --> 24:50.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't -- because we can't meet
our financial
standards. We can't meet the
financial obligations.

24:50.356 --> 24:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The hospital was
the town's
largest employer, and the loss
of more than

24:54.893 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
100 jobs was yet another blow to
a rural community
accustomed to hardship.

24:59.264 --> 25:05.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
G.M. JOINER, Mayor of Glenwood,
Georgia: This
through the years has been a
hair salon, styling-type

25:05.270 --> 25:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shop, tanning beds and that kind
of stuff.
And, of course, it's vacant now.

25:09.274 --> 25:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: G.M. Joiner has
been Glenwood's
mayor for three decades. His
father was the

25:13.779 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mayor before him. Joiner says
without the
traffic from hospital workers
and visitors,

25:18.951 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local businesses are barely
hanging on. The
owner of the local grocery
store, D.K. Patel,

25:25.324 --> 25:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says sales have plummeted.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.K. PATEL, Business Owner: Yes.
After the
hospital closed, we dropped
about 30 percent

25:30.763 --> 25:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sales. It's been hurting a lot.
All I can
say is, it's been hurting a lot.

25:35.768 --> 25:44.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
G.M. JOINER: Obviously, it was
our lifeblood,
mainstay. It's not
overemphasizing or trying

25:44.309 --> 25:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a doomsday prophet, but
it's devastating.
It's devastating.

25:49.381 --> 25:53.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Across the
country, rural hospitals
have struggled to adapt to a
steady decline

25:53.886 --> 25:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in rural populations and to a
new reality.
A series of budget control
measures passed

25:58.924 --> 26:04.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by Congress cut Medicare
payments. Further,
19 states have not expanded
Medicaid under

26:04.830 --> 26:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act, also
known as Obamacare.

26:08.300 --> 26:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's left many rural hospitals
with unpaid
bills just as federal subsidies
for the uninsured

26:13.772 --> 26:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are scheduled to taper off. For
many patients
in these small towns, the price
has been steep.

26:19.878 --> 26:26.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sue and Joe Connell of Glenwood,
age 75 and
77, now must drive two hours
round-trip to

26:26.418 --> 26:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their doctors' appointments.
There are no
physicians practicing anywhere
in their county.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe Connell has a blood disorder
and other
medical problems that keep him
and his wife

26:35.727 --> 26:37.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the road almost daily.

26:37.563 --> 26:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE CONNELL, Georgia: I'm seeing
about four
different doctors in Dublin. And
some trips,

26:43.168 --> 26:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this week, we're making
three trips to
Dublin; 90 percent of the miles
put on our

26:48.507 --> 26:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cars is going to the doctor in
Dublin. It
costs us. It costs a bunch of
money.

26:53.846 --> 26:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The pace of the
closures has
only escalated in recent years,
and the National

26:58.350 --> 27:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rural Health Association says
more than 280
hospitals with 700,000 patient
visits are

27:04.823 --> 27:07.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at risk of shutting down.

27:07.826 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Adams travels the state
meeting local
health care leaders. He's the
executive vice

27:13.765 --> 27:15.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president of the Georgia
Hospital Association.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK ADAMS, Executive Vice
President, Georgia
Hospital Association: Towns like
Glenwood

27:17.603 --> 27:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have always had a hospital. When
that hospital
closed, then these residents
immediately lost

27:23.141 --> 27:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access without an opportunity to
figure out
what that next access model was.
When you

27:28.647 --> 27:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have time to figure it out, I
think there
are some models out there that
could work.

27:32.584 --> 27:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: While the closures
have disrupted
emergency care, reduced options
for pregnant

27:36.889 --> 27:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women and drained doctors from
some rural
communities, researchers have
found, on average,

27:42.361 --> 27:46.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that closing down a rural
hospital doesn't
increase the chances of death.

27:46.598 --> 27:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, a separate investigation
by The Wall
Street Journal found surgeries
at many rural

27:51.637 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospitals carried a greater risk
of complications.
And for some emergencies,
patients can receive

27:56.975 --> 28:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better quality care at larger
hospitals that
treat more cases.

28:03.081 --> 28:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Kent is CEO of Meadows
Regional Medical
Center, a bustling, modern
hospital in Vidalia,

28:11.723 --> 28:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgia, that has taken in
patients from neighboring
towns like Glenwood.

28:15.694 --> 28:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, while rural residents
need access
to primary and urgent care, not
every town

28:21.233 --> 28:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can sustain a hospital, with
costly medical
equipment and a roster of
specialists.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KENT, CEO, Meadows Regional
Medical Center:
There has to be sort of a
critical mass to

28:28.807 --> 28:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to make any business
viable, and especially
a community hospital.

28:34.112 --> 28:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to be more efficient in
hospitals
if we are going to be
sustainable. And I think

28:39.084 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's one of the things that
you're seeing
that's driving the consolidation
in the industry.

28:43.622 --> 28:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Back in Glenwood,
Joe and Sue
Connell sit on their front porch
watching

28:48.260 --> 28:53.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the traffic leave town. They
worry that, someday
soon, they, too, may need to
leave for good.

28:53.832 --> 28:59.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE CONNELL: I got where I can't
drive. And
I don't know what we're going to
do when she

28:59.171 --> 29:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gets where she can't drive.

29:01.406 --> 29:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and Kaiser
Health News, I'm Sarah Varney in
Glenwood,

29:06.778 --> 29:08.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Georgia.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the coming
days, we will
look at a hospital in rural
Texas that turned

29:11.783 --> 29:17.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
similar challenges into
opportunity, and,
in the process, became one of
the top hospitals

29:17.422 --> 29:33.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the nation.

29:33.405 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tensions over GOP front-runner
Donald Trump
are playing out at the
Conservative Political

29:38.677 --> 29:40.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Action Conference, CPAC.

29:40.712 --> 29:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although his campaign canceled
the scheduled
appearance he had at the annual
conservative

29:45.417 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gathering, he's top of mind for
conference
attendees.

29:48.453 --> 29:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TODD ROKITA (R), Indiana:
What I'm seeing
so far is that people around the
country are

29:53.291 --> 29:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaking. They're sending a
message. And,
as an elected official, I need
to listen.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I intend to do.
That has nothing
to do -- that doesn't mean I'm
not going to

30:01.566 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote for Trump. If he's our
nominee, that's
who I will vote for.

30:04.369 --> 30:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY TURLEY, Cruz Supporter: I'm
thinking never
Trump. I want somebody who's
conservative

30:09.775 --> 30:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that will get government out
of the individual
people and let us have our
liberty.

30:14.713 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R), Texas:
The opposition
is -- it's no choice, you see?
So it shouldn't

30:21.186 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be never somebody. It should be
somebody that's
a conservative that runs on the
conservative

30:25.724 --> 30:27.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ticket.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX ROSS, Cruz Supporter: You
will notice
that he does very well in open
primaries,

30:30.128 --> 30:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as opposed to closed primaries.
Among Republicans,
he's not really that popular and
loses when

30:34.933 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just Republicans, but among
Democrats
who can come over and vote,
well, he wins

30:42.040 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by a lot.

30:44.042 --> 30:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I will not vote for Donald
Trump if he's
the nominee. This year, I was
actually excited.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was looking at Scott Walker. I
was looking
at a number of different
candidates. If Donald

30:50.949 --> 30:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump wins, I don't believe he
will be very
good at all. I just disagree
with many of

30:54.820 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his policies and his often
boorish behavior.

30:57.689 --> 31:02.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

31:02.694 --> 31:07.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields, and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks, who's joining us
today from

31:07.265 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Santa Barbara, California.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both,
gentlemen.

31:11.470 --> 31:15.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the CPAC conference, that
was going on
today. It will continue through
the weekend,

31:15.640 --> 31:17.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but let's start with last night.

31:18.009 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, what do we make of what
happened in
Detroit?

31:21.646 --> 31:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Embarrassing,
demoralizing.
I have been in Waco, Texas, and
out here this

31:27.219 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, and I have seen so many
Republicans
depressed.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm used to seeing moderate
Republicans say
they don't recognize their
party. But now

31:33.625 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have heard a lot of
conservative Republicans
say they don't recognize their
party., first

31:37.129 --> 31:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tone and temper of the
debate, the things
Donald Trump chose to speak
about, and then

31:41.032 --> 31:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just the nasty back and forth
and the shallow
name-calling.

31:45.403 --> 31:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was, I think, a demoralizing
debate, and
for a lot of Republicans,
possibly the worst

31:50.609 --> 31:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outcome you could get, with
Trump marching,
but everybody else sort of
hanging around,

31:54.679 --> 32:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a lot of internecine warfare
over the
future of the party, if there is
one.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Demoralizing,
Mark?

32:02.554 --> 32:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what strikes
me about
these debate is the name of
Ronald Reagan

32:04.890 --> 32:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is constantly invoked by just
about everybody.

32:08.160 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Lou Cannon, who was a
peerless political
reporter, Ronald Reagan's
biographer, for

32:13.198 --> 32:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a quarter of a century
covered him,
said of Ronald Reagan, anybody
-- a crowd

32:17.836 --> 32:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard Ronald Reagan, they felt
good about
them and they ended up feeling
better about

32:21.940 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

32:23.675 --> 32:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no way that anybody who
is not a
fierce partisan or blind
partisan of one of

32:29.047 --> 32:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidates could watch last
night and
feel better about themselves or
their country.

32:35.086 --> 32:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the front-runner for the
Republican nomination
to succeed to the office that
has been graced

32:42.027 --> 32:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Washington and Lincoln and
FDR publicly
boasts about the dimensions of
his private

32:49.601 --> 32:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts, you have reached a new
low.

32:51.636 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it is dispiriting. It's
beyond partisanship.
It's just discouraging as a
citizen, and I

32:58.944 --> 33:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know what we do, other
than tune out
to this. I know we can't, but I
just don't

33:04.649 --> 33:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think you should encourage it by
listening
to this stuff.

33:07.319 --> 33:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, does this
hurt Donald
Trump, does it hurt all the
candidates? Who

33:11.723 --> 33:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is affected, who is damaged by
this, or is
anybody?

33:15.460 --> 33:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, we will see.

33:17.395 --> 33:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think we will see
whether -- I
think ultimately the debate
helped him because

33:21.066 --> 33:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidates said they'd
support him in
the end. One of the things we
have noticed

33:24.069 --> 33:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this whole campaign is, Donald
Trump just
has more courage. Whatever you
might think

33:27.105 --> 33:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of him -- and I don't think much
of him, but
he has more courage than his
opponents.

33:30.508 --> 33:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for his opponents to say
he's a scam artist
and a con artist and a liar and
reckless and

33:35.080 --> 33:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would hurt the country, but I
would support
him, it just doesn't make sense.
And it was

33:38.383 --> 33:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lack of courage on their part
to go there.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mitt Romney today said he
would not support
them. And that has to be the
case. Normally,

33:44.789 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you support your party's
nominee, but with
somebody like Trump, if you say
all the things

33:49.427 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you say about him, you have got
to say, no,
I will not support him. I will
go third party

33:53.131 --> 33:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or I will won't vote in the
presidential election.

33:55.300 --> 34:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that failure of courage hurts
Trump. We
will see if a Romney-led
Republican officialdom

34:02.107 --> 34:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can launch a sustained attack on
Trump. I
have always thought that the
core attack is

34:06.578 --> 34:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to going to go after him for
what they
have been going after him for,
which is what

34:09.014 --> 34:13.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
voters like, that he's
politically incorrect
and sort of a change agent, but
go after him

34:13.151 --> 34:16.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the fact that he's a
narcissist who thinks
about himself and has betrayed
all those around

34:16.988 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're beginning to lay that
case. It may
be too late, but I think it's
the most effective

34:20.759 --> 34:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
case they have against him.

34:22.594 --> 34:27.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the case
that -- the
most damaging case, Mark? And do
you agree

34:27.666 --> 34:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with David this doesn't really
necessarily
hurt Donald Trump, what happened
last night?

34:32.037 --> 34:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it hasn't up
to now.

34:33.838 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At some point, it becomes
cumulative, Judy.
I think where they failed to
make the case,

34:40.445 --> 34:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first of all, Mitt Romney, who
was a -- had
to be an act of conscience on
his part to

34:47.986 --> 34:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make the statement -- there was
no political
payoff for him. It's to no real
advantage

34:53.959 --> 34:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politically or personally for
him to do it,
to make that statement.

34:59.030 --> 35:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem in Mitt Romney's
statement, first
of all, was that he himself
didn't acknowledge

35:04.436 --> 35:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he had sought and accepted
gratefully
Donald Trump's endorsement in
2012. But at

35:12.644 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same time, his message is,
you have been
bamboozled. You're not quite
bright enough

35:17.415 --> 35:19.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to understand this.

35:19.351 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they have to do is exactly
what was done
to Mitt Romney in 2012, and that
was to show

35:24.823 --> 35:30.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the people or at least to
present the people
who felt that they had been hurt
by his economic

35:30.395 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activities. Remember the company
that Bain
had taken over and then closed
the jobs, and

35:34.933 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they asked people to build the
stage while
they announced that they were --
their jobs

35:38.803 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were going overseas.

35:40.305 --> 35:44.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It has to be a personal
connection. You have
to show the people...

35:44.542 --> 35:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean, whether
it's Trump
University or one of the
other...

35:48.580 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)
MARK SHIELDS: Trump University
or the small
companies that have been hurt
when he went

35:50.582 --> 35:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into bankruptcy and put people
out of business,
people who lost their jobs, who
lost their

35:55.687 --> 35:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
savings, and who been hurt.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to put a human face on
it. And they
haven't done that. And when you
just say anybody

36:01.793 --> 36:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Trump, that's no endorsement
for any other
candidate.

36:06.798 --> 36:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
argument, David,
that Mitt Romney made yesterday?
He called

36:11.636 --> 36:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump a con artist. He
used just about
every negative term one can
think of.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that going to make any
difference?

36:19.577 --> 36:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you have to
believe that,
at some point, Trump voters,
like any other

36:23.948 --> 36:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters, rely on the information
they have.

36:25.917 --> 36:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of the -- a lot us of
have -- with
Trump voters, they buy Trump's
version of

36:30.422 --> 36:35.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
events, which is that he's a
successful businessman
and that he's made a ton of
money. But there

36:35.960 --> 36:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is another version of events,
which is Trump
Mortgage, Trump University,
Trump Steak, Trump

36:40.865 --> 36:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Airline, and the bankruptcies,
that he's not
a successful businessman.

36:46.171 --> 36:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a marketing genius who
offers no substance.
And people either got pushed
into subprime

36:50.575 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loans by Trump Mortgage, or they
got suckered
into racking up huge credit card
debt to buy

36:54.913 --> 36:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courses on Trump University, and
they were
left high and dry when those
things went belly

36:59.551 --> 37:01.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

37:01.419 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's a story that I
think can be
told. In a country which is
feeling betrayed,

37:05.457 --> 37:11.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he is a mass and serial
betrayer. And so I
think that's the line that can
be used. But

37:11.496 --> 37:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to assume all voters are
information
voters, and, as they get more
information,

37:15.166 --> 37:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they could change their minds.

37:17.202 --> 37:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if it's not
Trump, Mark,
then who is it? Which one of
these other candidates?

37:22.040 --> 37:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz has, what, won four
states. Marco
Rubio's won one state. I mean,
is it Mitt

37:27.745 --> 37:29.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Romney?

37:29.614 --> 37:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: If you want to
know what -- how
weak the Republican field is
against Donald

37:32.984 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump at this point, Bernie
Sanders has won
more states than all the other
Republicans

37:38.756 --> 37:41.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other than Donald Trump.

37:41.126 --> 37:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one can talk about Bernie
Sanders has
made a marvelous insurgent
candidacy, but

37:45.997 --> 37:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they just -- they haven't been
competitive.
And John Kasich got very good
reviews last

37:52.937 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, which encourages him to
stay on the
stage, which is a part -- nobody
outside of

37:59.377 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kasich family sees any
logical way that
John Kasich can win the
nomination, other

38:05.049 --> 38:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than by some weirdly broken
convention outside
of Erie, Ohio, at the Cleveland
convention

38:13.358 --> 38:15.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that John Kasich somebody
brokers.

38:15.794 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as long as there are the
three of them,
none of them has the strength.
Marco Rubio,

38:22.967 --> 38:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, is reduced in stature
as a consequence
of his going back and forth in
this sort of

38:28.973 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
junior high school locker room
language with
Donald Trump. And Cruz just
doesn't show to

38:35.480 --> 38:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the kind of reach beyond a
certain regional
appeal.

38:39.617 --> 38:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David,
wasn't it Mitt
Romney's recommendation that
voters support,

38:44.489 --> 38:48.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think he said Rubio in
Florida, Kasich in
Ohio, Cruz in -- I mean, he's
encouraging

38:48.860 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
everyone to stay in.

38:50.895 --> 38:54.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well,
strategically, the idea
is to get -- prevent Trump from
getting a

38:54.599 --> 38:56.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
majority of delegates.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, I would say this is
bigger than
just one nomination. This is
about the future

38:59.237 --> 39:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Republican Party and
really the future
of the country. For almost a
century-and-a-half,

39:03.007 --> 39:08.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party has stood
for a certain
free market version of America,
an America

39:08.279 --> 39:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's about openness, that's
about markets,
that's about opportunity, and a
definition

39:12.650 --> 39:14.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what this country is.

39:14.552 --> 39:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump offers a very
contrasting image.
It's an image of closedness.
It's an image

39:19.224 --> 39:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of building walls, of closing
barriers, an
authoritarian style of
leadership. And so

39:24.462 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party's future is
at stake.

39:26.397 --> 39:30.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, I think
preserving that future
in some coherent form is the
number one task

39:30.602 --> 39:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the party. Ben Sasse, a
senator, has said
he is going to -- he is
advocating a temporary

39:35.840 --> 39:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third party, just a conservative
who could
run for president. You would
split the right-wing

39:40.445 --> 39:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote, the conservative voted,
and you would
lose the White House, but at
least you would

39:43.748 --> 39:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preserve some integrity of the
party and maybe
preserve the Senate and the
House of Representatives,

39:46.985 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if you can get some
conservatives to show
up for the polls.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's, I think, the frame
in which to
think, that it's not just about
one year.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about a long tradition in
American politics
which may be being replaced.

39:57.428 --> 40:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the short
run, as David
just said, Mark, that could be
good news for

40:01.499 --> 40:04.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton or Bernie
Sanders or whoever
is the Democratic nominee.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, it could be.

40:06.537 --> 40:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, I don't
write off Donald
Trump by any means. If you're
one of the two

40:11.075 --> 40:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidates on the field in...

40:12.777 --> 40:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean if there
were three
-- if there were three
candidates?

40:14.979 --> 40:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, no. I mean,
if, in fact,
he is the nominee running
against either Hillary

40:18.549 --> 40:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton or Bernie Sanders, it
seems most plausibly
Hillary Clinton right now --
Hillary Clinton

40:24.455 --> 40:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has tied herself, Judy, to
President Obama.

40:27.392 --> 40:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has run as Hillary Obama.
She has made
an appeal to African-American
voters. She

40:32.630 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has made an appeal to the most
loyal of Democrats,
that she represents a
continuation. So, whatever

40:38.770 --> 40:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens, whatever the October
surprise is
of 2016, and how President Obama
handles it

40:44.809 --> 40:50.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or doesn't handle it, her fate
is tied to
him and his performance and the
performance

40:50.315 --> 40:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his administration over the
next eight
months.

40:54.152 --> 41:00.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, you know, it's not a
lay-down hand, as
some Democrats say, oh, there's
no way Donald

41:00.525 --> 41:07.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump -- Donald Trump has
enlarged the electorate
in a way that is impressive. I
mean, yes,

41:07.498 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's alienated a lot of the
people David's
described. He's brought in a lot
of other

41:10.668 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to vote in the Republican
primary.

41:12.537 --> 41:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, what
about that?
There are people who have come
out to vote

41:16.107 --> 41:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in these primaries and caucuses
who weren't
engaged in the -- at least in
the last few

41:21.179 --> 41:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election cycles. Trump has
brought them out.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Right. They have
been displaced.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been displaced by the
economic crisis.
They feel they have been
displaced by immigration.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They feel they have been
displaced by globalization
and disrespected by the
political class. And,

41:33.458 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, there's some basis to
that.

41:35.693 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to see how that wakes
up into a
natural governing majority,
though. And I

41:40.665 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree with Mark. If you have two
people, then
anybody could win. There could
be a terrorist

41:44.802 --> 41:47.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attack. There could be a
recession. Nobody
knows what could happen, and
Trump could somehow

41:48.072 --> 41:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vault into the White House.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, given the numbers now, it's
very hard
to see he could win, given the
huge numbers

41:54.112 --> 41:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans, the vast majority
of Americans
who say they could not support
the guy. And

41:58.149 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still find it hard to believe
that somebody
as policy-thin and as
knowledge-thin would

42:03.121 --> 42:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very well -- he might be able to
wear well
with the electorate that we have
in the Republican

42:07.425 --> 42:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary. It's really hard to see
him wearing
well with a general election
electorate, which

42:10.928 --> 42:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a very different thing.

42:12.830 --> 42:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Mark,
in less than
a minute, just quickly to Bernie
Sanders and

42:17.368 --> 42:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, do you --
Bernie Sanders
is not getting out of the race.

42:21.439 --> 42:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does he -- is he a factor at
this point?

42:23.708 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, he's a
factor. I mean,
he's moved -- you heard Hillary
Clinton today

42:27.645 --> 42:28.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the excerpt on...

42:28.846 --> 42:30.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On trade.

42:30.748 --> 42:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: On trade. He's
moved her on
trade, I mean, or at least
helped her to move,

42:34.619 --> 42:36.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put it that way.

42:36.487 --> 42:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the pipeline, the Canadian
pipeline, he's
moved her on that. You know, we
had today

42:42.827 --> 42:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news, Judy, of job increases and
wages actually
going down. So we now have the
top one-tenth

42:50.234 --> 42:55.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 1 percent, to qualify for
that distinct
group, you have had to have your
wages increased

42:55.273 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
500 percent since Ronald Reagan
was president.

42:58.042 --> 43:02.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet the median household
income today
is lower than it was 18 years
ago. It's just

43:03.047 --> 43:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly what David was talking
about. And
Bernie Sanders turned out more
people in Colorado,

43:08.553 --> 43:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where he won 60 to 40, than had
ever turned
out before. There is
encouragement for him

43:13.624 --> 43:14.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to keep going.

43:15.059 --> 43:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, on that
note, gentlemen,
a lot to chew over.

43:19.230 --> 43:24.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you both.

43:24.535 --> 43:39.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Loving this and
hating that.
When everyone's a critic on
social media,

43:39.750 --> 43:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's a professional critic to
do?

43:42.186 --> 43:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf
conversation.

43:44.689 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SAMUEL L. JACKSON, Actor:
Gentlemen, what
are you prepared to do?

43:49.794 --> 43:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When the movie
"The Avengers"
came out in 2012, with a cast of
big stars,

43:55.333 --> 43:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including Samuel L. Jackson, New
York Times
film critic

43:58.736 --> 44:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. Scott wrote: "The secret of
'The Avengers"
is that it is a snappy little
dialogue comedy

44:04.175 --> 44:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dressed up as something else,
that something
else being a giant ATM for
Marvel and its

44:09.814 --> 44:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new studio overlords, the Walt
Disney Company."

44:12.450 --> 44:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT, Film Critic, The New
York Times:
So, the day that review
appeared, Samuel L.

44:16.954 --> 44:23.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jackson sent out a tweet saying,
"Avengers
fans, we need to find A.O. Scott
a new job,

44:23.528 --> 44:24.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one he can actually do."

44:24.562 --> 44:25.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: One he can
actually do?

44:25.696 --> 44:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: One he can actually
-- yes.

44:27.632 --> 44:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, well, there is
probably isn't
any job I could -- other job I
could actually

44:30.668 --> 44:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do. And I thought, well, what is
this job
and how do you actually do it?

44:34.572 --> 44:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scott's answer
comes in the
new book "Better Living Through
Criticism:

44:38.309 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How to Think About Art,
Pleasure, Beauty,
and Truth."

44:41.979 --> 44:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been reviewing films for
The Times since
2000. But his first love was
literature. He

44:47.251 --> 44:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never took a film class. And his
book goes
well beyond film, to all kinds
of art forms,

44:53.024 --> 44:54.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to how we see the world, how we
make judgments.

44:55.092 --> 44:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this where you write the
reviews?

44:56.894 --> 44:59.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: Sometimes. There
have been reviews
written here.

44:59.564 --> 45:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We talked about
it at Gorilla
Coffee near his home in
Brooklyn.

45:03.668 --> 45:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: One of the things
you often hear
about critics is that we're
failed artists,

45:08.506 --> 45:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of taking revenge on...

45:09.907 --> 45:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You couldn't make
a movie,
so you're...

45:11.776 --> 45:14.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: I couldn't make a
movie. But I
would never want to make a
movie. It would

45:14.178 --> 45:16.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be terrible.

45:16.113 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I kind of wanted to think
about, well,
but what is this? I think
criticism is something

45:19.116 --> 45:26.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that helps to sustain and
support creativity
and art and the appreciation of
it.

45:27.024 --> 45:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wanted to kind of explain
how that works
and what the basis of it is, and
have criticism

45:36.133 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
properly understood as something
that we're
always doing that is a part of
our lives and

45:40.938 --> 45:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a part of our culture and a part
of how the
whole messy human enterprise of
figuring out

45:48.913 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who we are and what our lives
means. It moves
forward.

45:52.483 --> 45:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But in making the
case for
criticism as a kind of way of
thinking and

45:58.856 --> 46:04.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judging, there's an implicit,
actually explicit
critique of our culture, right,
that we don't

46:04.562 --> 46:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do that enough, right, that we
don't value
looking hard or judging.

46:09.400 --> 46:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: Right. Yes, I mean,
that was one
of the impulses behind the book,
was to make

46:15.139 --> 46:22.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a case for that kind of
thinking, that kind
of discussion, that kind of
discourse, because

46:22.346 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think there is so much
premature certainty
and overinflated argument.

46:29.420 --> 46:40.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just also wanted to push
back against,
I think, the passivity that
sometimes befalls

46:41.032 --> 46:43.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us as consumers.

46:43.100 --> 46:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The other thing
that you run
up against all the time is the
everyone's

46:47.271 --> 46:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a critic today, right, in the
age of social
media.

46:52.743 --> 46:54.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A.O. SCOTT: Right. Yes.

46:54.612 --> 46:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I don't have to
go to you,
obviously. I can go to a million
other places,

46:55.780 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I can damn well write my own
review if
I want.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: Right, and you can.

46:58.983 --> 47:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that's a good thing.
And I think
that what it means is that
critics in positions

47:05.556 --> 47:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like mine can't just sort of
assume -- can't
rest on our laurels, can't just
figure, well,

47:12.096 --> 47:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm in The New York Times, so
I'm going to
say what I say without
challenge.

47:16.400 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to say it, we're
going to be challenged,
and we're going to have to prove
ourselves,

47:22.473 --> 47:25.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or outwrite the competition day
in and day
out.

47:25.676 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're in an age
of sequels
and reboots and packaging of
everything.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A.O. SCOTT: Yes. Yes.

47:32.583 --> 47:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do -- where
do you see
the world of film nowadays?

47:35.219 --> 47:40.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: It's a complicated
question, because,
you know, it's easy to complain
generally,

47:41.025 --> 47:47.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's correct to complain
about the lack
of originality, the sequels, the
endless recycling

47:47.998 --> 47:49.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of all these products.

47:49.967 --> 47:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that there is, even
within that
system, the possibility of some
real creativity.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think also...

47:57.641 --> 48:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have to hope
so, right,
since you're going to be
watching a lot of

48:00.845 --> 48:01.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
movies.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A.O. SCOTT: I do hope so.

48:03.314 --> 48:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the most interesting
things and,
in a way, confusing things about
doing my

48:07.618 --> 48:14.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job now is that the boundaries
between what
is -- what are movies and what
is TV are less

48:14.391 --> 48:16.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and less clear.

48:16.260 --> 48:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot -- I don't
feel like there
is any shortage of really
interesting and

48:23.234 --> 48:31.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of novel stuff to watch. I
think the
challenge is finding it and
helping it, in

48:31.742 --> 48:37.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way, helping those movies or
TV shows or
whatever they are, wherever they
come from,

48:37.381 --> 48:38.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
find some kind of audience.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is part of
the job of
the critic.

48:40.384 --> 48:42.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A.O. SCOTT: Yes.

48:42.453 --> 48:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a very important job
now, because
we're in the state of kind of
cultural superabundance

48:48.259 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of glut.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sort of wonderful
and horrifying
at the same time.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A.O. SCOTT: It's wonderful and
horrifying
at the same time.

48:54.331 --> 48:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's paralyzing. And we need to
figure out
how to help ourselves and how to
help each

48:59.403 --> 49:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other kind of navigate that. And
it's also
true that no single critic in
any discipline

49:05.476 --> 49:08.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can kind of take it all in and
then dole it
out.

49:08.679 --> 49:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you -- it's sort of like you
have to find
someone, I think, who you can
trust to kind

49:15.186 --> 49:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of accompany you along that path
and sorting
through all that stuff.

49:21.692 --> 49:26.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Find someone you
trust, and
get yourself to a screen, book
or work of

49:26.463 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
art, but, first, have another
coffee.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Gorilla Coffee in Brooklyn,
I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:34.038 --> 49:40.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can find more
of our book
conversations on our Arts page
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:40.277 --> 49:45.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, finally tonight, our
"NewsHour" Shares:
something that caught our eye
that might be

49:46.050 --> 49:48.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:48.152 --> 49:54.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, 30-year-old Darius
Nabors decided
to quit his job to go on a
journey of a lifetime,

49:54.491 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his goal, to visit all 59
national parks in
59 weeks. The trip was inspired
by his father,

50:01.966 --> 50:07.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former park ranger, and is
timed to celebrate
the centennial anniversary of
the National

50:07.404 --> 50:09.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Park Service.

50:09.340 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke to Nabors by phone this
week as he
and his friend Trevor Kemp
visited Death Valley,

50:15.112 --> 50:17.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their 34th park so far.

50:17.114 --> 50:20.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIUS NABORS, Visiting Every
U.S. National
Park: My name is Darius Nabors.
And I am visiting

50:20.517 --> 50:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all 59 national parks in 59
weeks to celebrate
the 100th anniversary of the
National Park

50:25.990 --> 50:27.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Service.

50:27.825 --> 50:31.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We started our trip in Virginia,
and then
we drove to Ohio, to Cuyahoga
Valley National

50:31.662 --> 50:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park. And then we kind of went
north through
Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
and up to Alaska.

50:37.568 --> 50:43.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the great things that we
saw in Alaska
in Katmai National Park was the
Valley of

50:43.340 --> 50:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten Thousand Smokes. So, in
1912, there was
the largest volcanic eruption in
the 20th

50:48.045 --> 50:52.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century. And the scale was just
huge. And
we hiked onto this valley that
had 700 feet

50:52.850 --> 50:57.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ash and pumice. So you went
from being
in this, like, verdant green
Alaska forest

50:57.821 --> 51:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to walking on the moon in just a
matter of
minutes.

51:01.125 --> 51:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We came to Washington and did
one of my all-time
favorite hikes, where we hiked
around Mount

51:07.531 --> 51:11.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rainier on the Wonderland Trail.
While we
were there, there was also the
super blood

51:11.468 --> 51:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moon eclipse. And so one of the
nights, we
hiked back out and saw the moon
as it was

51:17.408 --> 51:21.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming out of the eclipse and
kind of rising
over Mount Rainier.

51:21.545 --> 51:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just came from Sequoia
National Park,
where they have some of the
largest trees

51:24.815 --> 51:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world, and the scale and
immensity
of these trees is really
indescribable. You're

51:30.354 --> 51:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing at the base of it,
looking up, and
the tree's as tall as a football
field, and

51:34.358 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you just can't -- you can't get
a sense of
scale because it is so tall.

51:38.963 --> 51:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, we're actually in
Death Valley.
We lucked out, because once
about every 10

51:44.001 --> 51:49.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, Death Valley has what's
called a superbloom.
And, so, when they have really
big rains in

51:49.139 --> 51:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fall, the wild flowers will
bloom really
well in the spring. And so we're
going to

51:54.812 --> 52:00.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go and visit fields of wild
flowers in the
hottest and driest place in the
United States.

52:00.517 --> 52:04.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of my friends ask me for
great photos
of the parks, and they ask me
what my favorite

52:04.922 --> 52:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
park is or what's the coolest
experience,
and I think that's the really
special part

52:09.426 --> 52:15.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it. I can't explain to
you, at least
not in words, what it's like to
see Denali,

52:15.632 --> 52:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mountain, rise 7,000 feet
above the surrounding
mountains.

52:19.436 --> 52:23.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of those places where a
photograph
just doesn't do it justice. And
that's the

52:23.273 --> 52:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing with a lot of these parks,
is, we try
and capture some great
photographs, but if

52:27.211 --> 52:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you want to truly see these
parks, you have
to get out there and visit them
yourself.

52:31.715 --> 52:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great pictures,
though.

Darius Nabors and Trevor Kemp
plan to finish
their journey at Acadia National
Park in Maine

52:39.990 --> 52:45.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on August 25. That's the
National Park Service's
100th birthday.

52:45.295 --> 52:50.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour" online:
Banksy, the elusive
artist behind the million-dollar
works of

52:50.901 --> 52:56.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political graffiti, may have
been tagged.
A new mathematical analysis
claims to have

52:56.640 --> 53:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identified the anonymous street
artist. You
can see why they think they have
uncovered

53:01.278 --> 53:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the biggest mysteries in
the art world.
That's on our home page.

53:05.516 --> 53:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

GWEN IFILL: According to his
foes, the Republican
front-runner is a con man, a
liar, and, worst

53:24.301 --> 53:29.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all, unelectable. Then, why
have all the
remaining Republican candidates
promised to

53:29.673 --> 53:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support him if becomes the
nominee? Welcome

We sort through the latest
amazing twists
and turns in the 2016 campaign

"Washington Week" -- Judy.

53:53.330 --> 53:58.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back, right here,
on Monday,
as I join "The Atlantic"'s James
Fallows on

53:58.669 --> 54:04.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his trek across the country to
explain how
America is putting itself back
together.

54:04.541 --> 54:06.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy
Woodruff.

54:06.844 --> 54:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
