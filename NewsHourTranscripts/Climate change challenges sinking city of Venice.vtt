MORE TOURISTS THAN RESIDENTS,

08:02.566 --> 08:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT UPSETS VENETIANS LIKE

08:04.100 --> 08:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTEO SECCHI.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE VENETIAN WAY OF LIFE IS

08:10.200 --> 08:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT RISK, SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE

08:11.766 --> 08:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VANISHING.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ALWAYS FEWER OF US.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE LOSING OUR CULTURE.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WHEN A VENETIAN LEAVES

08:17.000 --> 08:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITY, HE DOESN'T JUST LEAVE

08:18.233 --> 08:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITY, HE LEAVES A WAY OF

08:19.566 --> 08:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFE AND CULTURE.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: IN THIS FRAGILE

08:23.100 --> 08:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY, SOME RESIDENTS SAY HUGE

08:24.466 --> 08:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOURIST CRUISE SHIPS ARE MAKING

08:25.733 --> 08:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTERS WORSE.

08:29.033 --> 08:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMMASO CACCIARI IS THE FOUNDER

08:30.866 --> 08:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE GROUP "NO GRANDI NAVI,"

08:32.400 --> 08:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANING "NO LARGE SHIPS."

08:34.166 --> 08:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WANTS TO BAN LARGE CRUISE

08:35.366 --> 08:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIPS FROM ENTERING THE VENICE

08:36.700 --> 08:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAGOON.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE'S A MASS AMOUNT OF

08:41.366 --> 08:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER THAT PUSHES BACK AND

08:42.533 --> 08:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORTH.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CALLED SIPHONING.

08:44.766 --> 08:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S LIKE AN ACCORDION THAT

08:45.900 --> 08:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCKS THE FOUNDATION OF THE

08:47.033 --> 08:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S NO CONCRETE UNDER HERE.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S MUD, SOFT MATERIAL THAT

08:50.866 --> 08:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETS SUCKED OUT.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THIS PIER, HE SAYS,

08:53.566 --> 08:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBUILT SEVEN YEARS AGO, IS

08:54.766 --> 08:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF DAMAGE

08:56.300 --> 08:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE CRUISE SHIPS.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY PASS BY, THEY CREATE

08:59.500 --> 09:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HUGE PRESSURE THAT

09:01.033 --> 09:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY SUCKS THE SEDIMENT OUT

09:02.866 --> 09:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM UNDERNEATH US AND ACTUALLY

09:04.833 --> 09:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWERS THE FOUNDATION.

09:07.133 --> 09:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN SEE IT REALLY RIGHT

09:07.833 --> 09:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE YOUR EYES HERE WITH THESE

09:10.066 --> 09:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRICKS HERE.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRUISE SHIPS EMPLOY FIVE

09:12.400 --> 09:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSAND VENETIANS, BUT THE

09:13.866 --> 09:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VENICE PORT AUTHORITY SAYS ONLY

09:15.066 --> 09:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEIR

09:16.166 --> 09:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSENGERS GET OFF THEM AND

09:17.866 --> 09:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEND MONEY IN THE CITY.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REINING IN THE SHIPS AND THE

09:20.966 --> 09:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOURISTS IS ONE CHALLENGE HUMANS

09:22.166 --> 09:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN CONTROL.

09:23.933 --> 09:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROLLING THE SEAS IS NOT.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS WHY MARINE SCIENTIST

09:27.333 --> 09:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCA ZAGGIA IS PUTTING HIS FAITH

09:29.100 --> 09:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE MOSE PROJECT TO SAVE

09:30.800 --> 09:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VENICE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE SYSTEM MUST WORK.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ALTERNATIVE IS WHAT?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE SYSTEM MUST WORK.

09:38.033 --> 09:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVES AT THIS

09:39.100 --> 09:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAS TO WORK.
