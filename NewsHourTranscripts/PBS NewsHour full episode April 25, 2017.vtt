00:09.709 --> 00:15.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump calms
congressional nerves
over a potential government
shutdown by dropping

00:15.115 --> 00:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insistence on money now for a
Mexico border
wall.

00:18.952 --> 00:19.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:19.953 --> 00:21.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Democrats need
a strong, progressive agenda.

00:23.456 --> 00:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down
Senator Bernie Sanders
to discuss the Trump agenda and
what Democrats

00:29.729 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need to do to start winning
again.

00:32.799 --> 00:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And dreamers worry about a
potential nightmare.

00:36.236 --> 00:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young undocumented immigrants
prepare for
the worst, as the Trump
administration adopts

00:41.408 --> 00:43.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hard-line approach.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE, Undocumented Immigrant:
Losing my job,
losing the ability to teach my
kids, being

00:46.880 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separated from my family, losing
everything
that I know, I don't think it
can get any

00:53.853 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worse than that.

00:55.188 --> 01:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:04.464 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A federal judge
in San Francisco
has blocked President Trump's
order on so-called

01:15.575 --> 01:17.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctuary cities.

01:17.377 --> 01:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sought to withhold some
federal funds from
localities that don't cooperate
with U.S.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration authorities.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The district judge said today
that the president
has no authority to take that
step.

01:29.122 --> 01:35.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His ruling is in effect
nationwide while a
lawsuit against the order is
being heard.

01:35.128 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bulls had the run of Wall
Street today,
and the Nasdaq hit a milestone.

01:39.866 --> 01:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rally was fueled by strong
earnings at
Caterpillar, McDonald's and
other companies.

01:45.071 --> 01:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average

The Nasdaq rose 41 points, to
close above

01:57.350 --> 02:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the S&amp;P 500 added 14.

02:00.820 --> 02:06.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress is back in session, and
raising new
questions about contacts between
Trump advisers

02:06.759 --> 02:08.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the Russians.

02:08.595 --> 02:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leaders of the House Oversight
Committee said
today that former Trump National
Security

02:12.866 --> 02:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adviser Michael Flynn broke the
law by taking
money from Russian organizations
in 2015.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a retired general, he was
barred from doing
so.

02:24.010 --> 02:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Chairman Jason
Chaffetz and ranking
Democrat Elijah Cummings spoke
after reviewing

02:29.549 --> 02:30.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classified material.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D), Maryland:
There is no
evidence, as the chairman said,
anywhere in

02:34.554 --> 02:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these documents that said he
reported the
funds he received for this trip.

02:38.992 --> 02:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also no evidence that
he sought permission
to obtain these funds from a
foreign source.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah: He was
supposed
to seek permission and receive
permission

02:50.703 --> 02:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from both the secretary of state
and the secretary
of the Army prior to traveling
to Russia,

02:56.209 --> 02:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to not only accept that payment,
but to engage
in that activity.

02:59.846 --> 03:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An attorney for
Flynn defended
his actions.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Representative
Cummings complained
that the White House refused to
hand over

03:07.987 --> 03:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relevant documents on Flynn.

03:10.523 --> 03:15.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, a Senate
subcommittee announced
that it will hear next month
from former acting

03:15.328 --> 03:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Sally
Yates, who played
a role in Flynn's firing.

03:19.933 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former Director of National
Intelligence
James Clapper will also testify.

03:25.338 --> 03:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia denied again today that
it is arming
Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.

03:30.310 --> 03:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is after the top U.S.
commander in Afghanistan
said that he wouldn't refute
such reports.

03:36.783 --> 03:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Moscow, Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov
dismissed the claims.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): As to statements
about alleged

03:44.757 --> 03:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supplies of arms by us to the
Taliban, these
are unprofessional, they are
baseless.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever negative things they
say about Russia
now, simply look into it.

03:54.033 --> 03:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one is providing a single
fact that would
prove such negative statements.

03:57.804 --> 04:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia has said
that it does
maintain ties with Taliban
officials, but

04:03.476 --> 04:06.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only to push for peace
negotiations.

04:06.813 --> 04:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea held mass live-fire
exercises
today for the 85th anniversary
of its military,

04:13.519 --> 04:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it didn't carry out a
nuclear test, as
feared.

04:16.956 --> 04:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, Pyongyang marked the
occasion with
celebrations.

04:20.526 --> 04:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people left flowers at the
statues of
the country's former leaders.

04:25.131 --> 04:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish warplanes targeted
Kurdish forces
in Iraq and Syria today, drawing
criticism

04:31.471 --> 04:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the U.S. Turkey's military
released video
of the operations, and activists
in Syria

04:37.944 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said more than 20 combatants
were killed.

04:40.813 --> 04:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most belonged to a Syrian
Kurdish militia
that is fighting the Islamic
State.

04:46.919 --> 04:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish officials claimed the
group is linked
to rebels who are battling the
government

04:51.224 --> 04:52.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Turkey.

04:52.992 --> 04:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Arkansas has
carried out the
nation's first double execution
in 17 years.

04:59.132 --> 05:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened last night, when two
men were
put to death within three hours.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

05:06.105 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For 12 years,
the death
chamber at the state prison in
Varner, Arkansas,

05:11.377 --> 05:12.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sat unused.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But last night, both Jack Jones
and Marcel
Williams died there.

05:16.849 --> 05:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both had been on death row for
more than 20
years, both for rape and murder.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jones went first, as witnesses
looked on.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LIPPMAN, Reporter: He
said: "I'm so
sorry.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm so genuinely sorry.

05:27.794 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope someday you can learn
more about me
to learn that I'm not a
monster."

05:33.032 --> 05:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The daughter
of Jones' victim,
Mary Phillips, had survived the
attack in

05:37.136 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1995.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was just 11 years old.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LACY PHILLIPS, Daughter of
Victim: I'm glad
it's done.

05:42.208 --> 05:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm glad that part of my life is
-- that chapter
is closed.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lawyers for
Marcel Williams
charged that Jones had been
gulping for air

05:52.685 --> 05:54.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as he died.

05:54.187 --> 05:58.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But after a brief delay,
Williams was given
the lethal injection as well.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd expressed remorse last
month.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCEL WILLIAMS, Inmate: To
those I hurt,
I'm sorry is not enough.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish I could take it back, but
I can't.

06:06.966 --> 06:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The mother of
Stacy Errickson,
the woman killed by Williams in
1994, said

06:12.538 --> 06:15.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he'd finally gotten what he
deserved.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arkansas has now put three men
to death in
the last week.

06:18.711 --> 06:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sudden rush is because one
of the state's
lethal injection drugs,
midazolam, expires

06:23.216 --> 06:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the end of April, and the
drugmakers, citing
concerns over how the drugs were
obtained

06:27.887 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how they are being used, are
trying to
block the state from getting any
more.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Governor Asa Hutchinson defended
the process.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASA HUTCHINSON (R), Arkansas: I
don't want
to go back to these victims'
families and

06:38.164 --> 06:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, well, we're worried about
how this looks,
or the speed of this, and so
we're not going

06:44.637 --> 06:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to carry out the will
of the jury
and courts and the sentencing.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The state
hoped to execute
eight men this month.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Four have been blocked by
courts.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A final execution is set for
Thursday.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

06:59.919 --> 07:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, a
special commission
in Oklahoma recommended a
continued moratorium

07:05.825 --> 07:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on executions until the system
for carrying
them out is reformed.

07:11.397 --> 07:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And first daughter Ivanka Trump
got a rough
reception today at a women's
summit in Berlin,

07:17.370 --> 07:19.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Germany.

07:19.138 --> 07:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At one point during a panel
discussion, the
audience groaned and hissed as
she argued

07:23.309 --> 07:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that her father is a -- quote --
"tremendous
champion" of enabling women and
families.

07:28.314 --> 07:33.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later, she dismissed the
reaction as -- quote
-- "politics" and said, "I'm
used to it.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's fine."

07:35.388 --> 07:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the White
House and Congress attempting to
avert a government

07:38.891 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shutdown; Senator Bernie Sanders
weighs in
on what Democrats need to do to
get back on

07:44.697 --> 07:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top; a new tariff President
Trump has levied
against Canada, and much more.

07:54.740 --> 08:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top; a new tariff President
Trump has levied
against Canada, and much more.

08:01.747 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the biggest obstacles to
keeping the
United States government funded
beyond this

08:06.252 --> 08:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Friday's deadline may have been
averted today.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
starts us off.

08:12.291 --> 08:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
was at the
Capitol this morning for a
Holocaust remembrance

08:16.896 --> 08:18.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. President, are you
going to
insist on border funding?

08:20.132 --> 08:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But he ignored
shouted questions
about a government funding bill,
this after

08:24.337 --> 08:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numerous reports that Mr. Trump
told conservative
journalists last night that he's
open to delaying

08:30.042 --> 08:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a border wall down payment until
September.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats on Capitol Hill
declared a kind
of victory on the issue.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Now,
last night, we received a bit of
good news,

08:40.186 --> 08:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just for Democrats, but for
the country,
that the president is easing off
his demands

08:46.459 --> 08:48.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for a border wall in the
government funding
bill.

08:48.961 --> 08:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senate Minority
Leader Chuck
Schumer and other Democrats have
insisted

08:52.532 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that border wall money would
jeopardize the
larger funding bill.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And not all Republicans support
it either.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.172 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Now, we Democrats
have been
opposed to including the wall in
this bill

09:02.275 --> 09:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the beginning of the
negotiations.

09:05.645 --> 09:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no plan to make Mexico
pay for it,
as the president promised it
would.

09:10.616 --> 09:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no plan to resolve the
eminent domain
issues on the border, and the
money is better

09:15.955 --> 09:17.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
used elsewhere.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
was quick to
insist that whenever the funding
comes, his

09:20.693 --> 09:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to build a border barrier
is alive and
well.

09:24.063 --> 09:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, he tweeted: "Don't
let the fake
media tell you that I changed my
position

09:28.534 --> 09:30.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the wall."

09:30.536 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He followed up at a White House
event this
afternoon.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We're going to have the wall
built.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I don't what people are
talking.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I watch these shows and the
pundits in the
morning, they don't know what
they're talking

09:38.811 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The wall gets built, 100
percent.

09:41.747 --> 09:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Even if the
border wall issue
drops away, other obstacles
could still derail

09:46.252 --> 09:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the spending bill, for one,
health benefits
for coal miners.

09:49.789 --> 09:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of miners will lose
their health
care this weekend if Congress
doesn't act.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lawmakers on both sides,
including Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
favor it,

09:58.631 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but have to find funding.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I'm
in favor of the permanent fix on
miners health

10:02.668 --> 10:04.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's my hope that that will be
included in
the final package.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Other problems?

10:09.575 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democratic sources say
Republicans want the
bill to give religious
businesses more leeway

10:14.213 --> 10:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to opt out of coverage for
women's reproductive
health.

10:17.283 --> 10:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, the clock is ticking
for Congress
to pass a long-term spending
bill before Saturday,

10:23.155 --> 10:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump's 100th day in
office.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sources have now confirmed
to us that
Republicans' latest offer to
Democrats on

10:30.496 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the spending plan has dropped
the border wall
money altogether.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, senators from both parties
say they
think it's now likely there will
have to be

10:37.937 --> 10:40.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some kind of short-term deal for
a few days.

10:40.906 --> 10:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not even sure that they
could write
and passes a larger bill by
Friday.

10:45.411 --> 10:50.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All that means, Judy, is that
probably we
will be talking about this
spending fight

10:50.216 --> 10:51.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into next week.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, going into
next week.

10:53.085 --> 10:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if the White House is
dropping the demands
for its funding for the border
wall, Lisa,

10:57.423 --> 10:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what are the remaining sticking
points?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, among those sticking
points are women's
health, say Democrats.

11:03.095 --> 11:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that Republicans, as
they have brought
up many times in the past few
years, would

11:07.033 --> 11:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this bill to include more
exemptions
on religious grounds for funding
contraception

11:12.505 --> 11:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other women's health issues
for employers.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that goes along with the
Hobby Lobby
case and other things.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats firmly say that's not
something
they will support.

11:20.913 --> 11:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some Republicans, Judy, say
they're not
sure that they really will go to
the mattress,

11:25.084 --> 11:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so to speak, over that issue,
that they might
be wiling to take that issue
down the road

11:29.555 --> 11:30.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a ways.

11:30.556 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are the other problems?

11:31.557 --> 11:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Honestly, Judy, it's not quite
clear.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of frustration up
here, and
it seems there is just a lot of
tying up of

11:36.729 --> 11:37.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very loose ends.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, stay
with us.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to bring in John Yang,
who is at
the White House reporting for
us.

11:43.602 --> 11:45.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John, tell us.

11:45.404 --> 11:51.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the president has, in
essence, backed down
on the demand that they fund
this border wall

11:51.077 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right now, what's the rationale?

11:53.312 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear the president saying
when the cameras
with were him earlier today,
it's still a

11:58.751 --> 12:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
priority, it's going to happen
soon, but he's
dropped it as a demand.

12:02.221 --> 12:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He dropped it as a
demand because
they realize the -- or
acknowledge the political

12:07.093 --> 12:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality that they weren't going
to get it
without a big fight, without
jeopardizing

12:11.263 --> 12:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or threatening a government
shutdown.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're putting it off.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's still their top priority.

12:16.235 --> 12:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They still -- Mr. Trump says he
will still
build this wall in his first
term, and they're

12:21.807 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting off this fight until
September -- the
next fiscal year, the spending
year that begins

12:28.180 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in October.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, this money is only
until the end
of September.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to work to the
next spending
year to get money.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they have got enough
money to do
planning, but there is no
indication of why

12:39.191 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they think this fight will be
any easier in
fiscal year 2018.

12:43.262 --> 12:47.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, back to
you.

12:47.433 --> 12:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the White House has clearly
moved its position
in the last 24 hours, are
Republicans and

12:54.473 --> 12:58.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats now looking at the
president as
somebody who is a whole lot
easier to deal

12:58.310 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with than they thought?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It depends on
who you speak
with.

13:01.580 --> 13:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Democrats will tell you,
those that
speak to you, you know, off
microphone, will

13:07.520 --> 13:12.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
say they think that the
Democrats -- the Republicans,
the White House completely
misplayed this.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think this has added to
enormous leverage
that they didn't feel that they
had here at

13:16.428 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Capitol until this week.

13:18.330 --> 13:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk to Republicans, some of
them will
say, again, off microphone, that
they're relieved

13:23.068 --> 13:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this has come off the
table.

13:25.004 --> 13:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is enormous skepticism and
some all-out
problems with the idea of a
border wall, especially

13:29.809 --> 13:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it really hasn't been
clearly defined
in their eyes.

13:33.179 --> 13:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's mainly relief, I
would say, at
the U.S. Capitol, but I do think
there are

13:37.149 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
real questions about the
strength of this
president in negotiating with
Congress and

13:42.988 --> 13:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perhaps making some strong-arm
moves that
have backfired against him, at
least this

13:49.161 --> 13:50.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, this
is all coming
as the president approaches his
100-day mark.

13:53.933 --> 13:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there concern at the White
House that the
president is not seen as a
strong leader?

13:59.305 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I tell you,
Judy, you know,
the president himself says this
is an artificial

14:03.175 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadline.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He calls it ridiculous.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Sean Spicer, the White House
press secretary,
echoes that.

14:08.814 --> 14:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the same time, the
communications office
is really working hard on this.

14:14.286 --> 14:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a series of briefings
this week, a
number of executive orders being
signed, Cabinet

14:19.325 --> 14:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretaries coming into the
Briefing Room
to talk to reporters, to talk
about what they

14:23.929 --> 14:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done, a big, splashy new
Web page on
the WhiteHouse.gov Web site
talking about

14:30.636 --> 14:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they have done in this
first 100 days.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're watching it all closely.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I know the two of you are.

14:38.377 --> 14:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang, Lisa Desjardins,
thank you.

14:48.420 --> 14:53.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang, Lisa Desjardins,
thank you.

14:53.525 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on these political
battles we have
been talking about and the
challenges facing

14:57.663 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats, I spoke this
afternoon with Senator
Bernie Sanders, the ranking
member of the

15:01.600 --> 15:03.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senate Budget Committee.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I started by asking whether
he thinks
an agreement will be reached to
avert a government

15:07.039 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shutdown.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Well, I certainly
hope there's going to be an
agreement, not

15:11.644 --> 15:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a short-term, but a long-term
agreement.

15:14.213 --> 15:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not and will not support
billions of
dollars going to a border wall
at the same

15:19.952 --> 15:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time as the Trump administration
wants to
throw 24 million people off of
health insurance,

15:25.824 --> 15:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut back on education, cut back
on the needs
of working people.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not something that I
will support.

15:33.265 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, today at
the White
House, the commerce secretary,
Wilbur Ross,

15:38.971 --> 15:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced with regard the trade
that the White
House, the president wants to
slap in essence

15:43.509 --> 15:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a terrific on Canadian lumber.

15:46.345 --> 15:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and the president often were
at least
in the same -- or what appeared
to be on the

15:51.250 --> 15:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same page when it came the trade
during the
campaign.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think of this move
today?

15:55.721 --> 15:57.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't
know enough
about it to comment
intelligently.

15:59.224 --> 16:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I do know is that, when
we have had
trade policies for decades now
that have cost

16:04.229 --> 16:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us millions of decent-paying
jobs, as profitable
corporations shut down in
America, they go

16:09.635 --> 16:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to China and they go to Mexico.

16:11.537 --> 16:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to fundamentally rethink
our trade
policy and make them work not
for the CEOs

16:16.442 --> 16:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of large corporations, but for
working people.

16:19.545 --> 16:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if Trump wants to develop a
rational trade
policy which demands that
corporations start

16:26.752 --> 16:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing in this country,
rather than China,
that's something that we can
work on.

16:30.456 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, I just don't
know enough about
the specifics of the lumber
situation.

16:34.593 --> 16:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is there a
specific move
you would like to see the
president make on

16:38.297 --> 16:39.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trade?

16:39.298 --> 16:41.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, as I have
said, I want
to see a trade policy which
works for American

16:44.003 --> 16:45.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

16:45.871 --> 16:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, what we have seen for
a very long
time is large corporations
shutting down plants

16:51.076 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, plants that are
often profitable,
in order to get cheap labor all
over the world.

16:57.349 --> 17:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is one of the reasons
why the middle
class in this country is
disappearing.

17:02.388 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have lost our manufacturing
base, and that's
an issue that has got to be
dealt with.

17:06.625 --> 17:11.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In that
connection, Senator,
you're reintroducing legislation
to increase

17:11.397 --> 17:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the minimum wage to $15 an hour,
I believe,
by 2024.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that's had a
tough time
getting through Congress in the
past.

17:20.506 --> 17:25.744 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
You now have the
Republican-controlled Senate,
House, a Republican White House.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this realistic?

17:26.779 --> 17:27.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:27.780 --> 17:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Of course it's
realistic.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what the American people
want.

17:31.016 --> 17:38.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is an outrage that we have a
$7.25-an-hour
federal minimum wage.

17:38.690 --> 17:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we talk about why the
middle class
is in decline, why people are
working two

17:43.062 --> 17:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or three jobs, working 50, 60
hours a week,
it's because wages in this
country are much

17:49.234 --> 17:50.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too low.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have got to raise the
minimum wage
over a period of years to the
year 2024 to

17:54.773 --> 17:56.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$15 an hour.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When people -- Judy, it is not a
radical idea
to say that, when you have
massive income

18:00.879 --> 18:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wealth inequality, the very
rich becoming
much richer, it is not a radical
idea that

18:05.617 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say that, in America, if you
work 40 hours
a week, you shouldn't be living
in poverty.

18:09.621 --> 18:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what the American people
want, and
that's what we are going to
introduce.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, and I
think this is
in connection with that, you
said in an interview

18:16.562 --> 18:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two days ago, the Democratic
Party -- you
said this as an independent,
that the Democratic

18:20.933 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party is failing, that it needs
the change.

18:24.169 --> 18:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you saying there should be a
litmus test
to be a Democrat?

18:28.173 --> 18:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does one have to believe to
be a Democrat?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Judy, here is
the reality.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think it's just me
saying it.

18:34.379 --> 18:41.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now, you have the
Republicans controlling
the White House, right-wing
extremist Republicans

18:41.086 --> 18:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controlling the White House, the
U.S. House,
the U.S. Senate, two-thirds of
the governors

18:44.756 --> 18:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chairs, and in the last eight
years, Democrats
have lost 900 legislative seats
all over this

18:50.696 --> 18:51.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is a failed approach toward
politics.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in my view, the Democrats
need to do several
things.

18:57.803 --> 19:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, Democrats need to
become a 50-state
party.

19:01.507 --> 19:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't have a great party on
the West Coast
and the East Coast.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need to have a party in all
50 states.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the case right now.

19:09.281 --> 19:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I have been
running around
the country to Republican states
to galvanize

19:14.153 --> 19:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to get involved in the
political process.

19:16.255 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second of all, you need a
Democratic Party
which is a grassroots party,
which makes decisions

19:21.860 --> 19:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the bottom on up, not just
from the top
on down.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my view, it is not a question
of Trump
having won the election, it's a
question of

19:29.801 --> 19:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats having lost the
election.

19:32.571 --> 19:38.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats need a strong
progressive agenda
which says to the working class
of this country,

19:38.544 --> 19:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are going the stand and fight
for you,
we're going to raise the minimum
wage, pay

19:41.747 --> 19:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equity for women, we're going to
rebuild the
infrastructure, and we're going
to guarantee

19:46.018 --> 19:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care to all people as a
right.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to make public
colleges and universities
tuition-free.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We understand that there is
enormous pain
in this country.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to stand with
working people.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to take on the
billionaire class.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going the take on the drug
companies
and the insurance companies.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going the take on Wall
Street.

20:03.735 --> 20:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where I think the future
of the Democratic
Party lies.

20:06.271 --> 20:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And my question
is, does that
mean that some Democrats are not
acceptable?

20:10.442 --> 20:15.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, the special
congressional election
in Georgia last week, you
initially didn't

20:15.414 --> 20:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
endorse the Democrat, Jon
Ossoff.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you said he wasn't a
progressive.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Judy, don't
believe everything
you read in the corporate media.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jon Ossoff never asked me for an
endorsement,
never asked me.

20:28.727 --> 20:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course I want him to win the
election,
and of course I want the
Democrats to gain

20:33.498 --> 20:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
control of the U.S. House.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just so happened he never asked
me for an
endorsement.

20:37.603 --> 20:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I guess the
broader question
is, does a Democrat have to toe
a certain

20:42.741 --> 20:43.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line?

20:43.942 --> 20:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have said Democrats have to
do well in
red states.

20:45.711 --> 20:51.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, for example, a Heidi
Heitkamp in North
Dakota, Joe Manchin in West
Virginia, are

20:51.416 --> 20:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these Democrats, you consider
under the tent
that you would like to see,
under the umbrella

20:56.755 --> 20:57.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Democratic...

20:57.756 --> 20:58.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:58.757 --> 20:59.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: I think those
decisions are
going to be made by the people
in North Dakota,

21:02.461 --> 21:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where I think Heidi is quite
popular.

21:03.528 --> 21:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be made by the people
in West Virginia.

21:06.398 --> 21:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not my job to tell the
people in 435
congressional districts or in 50
states who

21:14.006 --> 21:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they should be supporting.

21:15.807 --> 21:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What a grassroots party is about
is people
getting excited, getting
involved in the local

21:20.879 --> 21:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political process, saying, we
want her to
run for office, we want him to
run for office,

21:25.317 --> 21:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we're going to get involved
and make sure
that he or she wins.

21:28.687 --> 21:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what I think the future
of the Democratic
Party is, not a few people in
Washington saying,

21:33.025 --> 21:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sorry, no good, or that's OK.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're saying
it's all right
with you that the Democratic
Party has elected

21:39.831 --> 21:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members who, for example,
disagree with you
on trade, who may disagree with
you on the

21:46.004 --> 21:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corporate tax rate, on issues
like abortion?

21:48.507 --> 21:49.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS: Right.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look, this is America.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Between you and me, Judy, I
would wish -- I
would love it if everybody in
America agreed

21:55.647 --> 21:57.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with me on every issue.

21:57.716 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't get my wife to agree
with me on every
issue, let alone the American
people.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's called democracy.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what it's about.

22:04.990 --> 22:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think -- you know, I have
supported
candidates whose views are very
different

22:09.294 --> 22:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than mine on the need the break
up Wall Street
banks, on the war in Iraq, on
trade issues.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course I have supported those
people.

22:17.602 --> 22:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My hope is that we're going to
see -- and
I believe it is the case --
we're going to

22:21.973 --> 22:25.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
see more and more strong
progressives running
for office.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my hope.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's my desire.

22:28.113 --> 22:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is up to -- that
decision is going
to be made by people in 50
states and 435

22:32.718 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
congressional districts.

22:34.152 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Bernie
Sanders, very
good to talk with you.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

22:40.759 --> 22:41.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:41.893 --> 22:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you, Judy.

22:47.632 --> 22:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:50.702 --> 22:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
undocumented
students fearful of deportation;
a new database

22:56.742 --> 23:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that tracks government spending;
and "The
Handmaid's Tale," Margaret
Atwood's dystopian

23:03.081 --> 23:05.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
novel, now a TV series.

23:05.350 --> 23:10.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As we touched on
earlier, there
is a trade dispute brewing
between the U.S.

23:10.622 --> 23:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and its northern neighbor.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is back with
that story.

23:14.459 --> 23:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump's decision
to slap tariffs on certain
lumber imported

23:18.397 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Canada escalated tensions
between the
two nations.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president has already
said he wants
to renegotiate or overhaul NAFTA
this summer.

23:26.938 --> 23:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's move drew a pointed
response from
Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau, who

23:30.942 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, "You cannot thicken this
border without
hurting people on both sides of
it."

23:35.747 --> 23:39.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a meeting with farmers this
afternoon,
President Trump came back with
some tough

23:39.384 --> 23:41.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
words of his own.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
People don't realize Canada has
been very

23:42.788 --> 23:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rough on the United States.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone thinks of Canada as
being wonderful.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so do I. I love Canada.

23:48.026 --> 23:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have outsmarted our
politicians for
many years, and you people
understand that.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we did institute a very big
tariff.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: And do you fear a
trade war with
Canada?

23:57.202 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Why not?

23:59.738 --> 24:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They have a
tremendous surplus
with the United States.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whenever they have a surplus, I
have no fear.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's get
some further
explanation about this move, and
what it means

24:07.979 --> 24:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the broader trade agenda of
the new president.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greg Ip covers all this for The
Wall Street
Journal, and he joins me now.

24:13.852 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour."

24:14.853 --> 24:16.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG IP, The Wall Street
Journal: Thank you.

24:16.655 --> 24:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, who would
have thought
that we'd have our first trade
flare-up of

24:19.357 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump administration with
Canada, of all
places.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Explain, what is this fight all
about?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG IP: It does sound like a
surprise, but
it shouldn't be surprising.

24:27.032 --> 24:30.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, remember, the Canada-U.S.
trade relationship
is still the world's largest.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a relationship that size
always generates
disputes.

24:34.005 --> 24:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this particular dispute
didn't fall out
of a clear spring sky.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been going on for literally
decades.

24:39.744 --> 24:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's rooted in the different way
Canada and
the United States charges
forestry companies

24:43.682 --> 24:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the trees that they cut down
and turn
into lumber.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the United States, they have
a market-based
system.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is an auction.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Companies compete against each
other to buy
the trees.

24:51.723 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Canada, the provincial
government is basically
assigned a fee that turns out to
be lower

24:56.828 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than the market price American
companies pay.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States claims that's
an unfair
subsidy.

25:02.267 --> 25:05.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this has been an ongoing
source of
dispute between the two
countries.

25:05.937 --> 25:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dispute that is under way
this week actually
began under the prior
administration.

25:10.208 --> 25:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There had been, if you will, a
truce between
the two countries.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That truce expired.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration had
been negotiating
with the Canadians to come up
with a permanent

25:18.149 --> 25:19.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
solution.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they failed.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even though this is being
portrayed
as the first salvo by Trump's
tough trade

25:23.822 --> 25:27.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regime, in fact, it's quite
possible that,
if Hillary Clinton were
president, we would

25:27.425 --> 25:29.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be in the same place.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say
Trump is successful
and he puts this tariff on
imported Canadian

25:32.764 --> 25:34.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lumber.

25:34.132 --> 25:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a consumer here in the U.S.,
would impact
would we likely see?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG IP: Well, remember, tariffs
are in the
end taxes.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And somebody has to pay that
tax.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this case, that tax will
be paid by
the buyers of that lumber, which
is the home

25:45.143 --> 25:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
builders primarily and the
people who buy
those homes.

25:48.179 --> 25:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Association of Home
Builders
estimates that there's about
$15,000 worth

25:52.584 --> 25:56.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of lumber in a typical new home,
a single-family
home in the United States.

25:56.821 --> 26:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This tariff will add about
$1,200 to the price
of that home.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's been the case that
because the market
had already anticipated
something like this,

26:04.963 --> 26:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lumber prices have already
started to move
up, so you won't necessarily see
an immediate

26:09.367 --> 26:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
impact from this point forward.

26:11.870 --> 26:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think one thing people are
forgetting
is that trade disputes are
two-sided.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the United States imposes
tariffs on
a partner like Canada, there is
always a possibility

26:20.879 --> 26:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Canada will say that's not
fair and retaliate.

26:22.781 --> 26:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at that point, you have to
ask the question,
which Canadian industry will
suffer because

26:26.885 --> 26:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Canadians have imposed
tariffs -- excuse
me -- which U.S. industry will
suffer because

26:31.423 --> 26:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Canadians retaliated against
it?

26:33.458 --> 26:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We're seeing
this Trump
move on wood.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also had some very strong
complaints about
Canadian milk.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, we saw him making
some noises about
steel in China.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There might be a move on
aluminum coming up.

26:44.736 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we starting to see now a
Trump trade policy
emerge?

26:48.039 --> 26:49.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG IP: I think we are.

26:49.407 --> 26:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he was first elected, there
was a lot
of fear of a trade war.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They listened to Trump's
rhetoric on the campaign.

26:53.778 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oh, we're going to put a 45
percent tariff
on China, a 35 percent tariff on
Mexico.

26:58.683 --> 27:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We haven't seen any of that.

27:00.552 --> 27:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's clear now that Trump and
his administration
doesn't want the start a trade
war, i.e.,

27:06.725 --> 27:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big tariff on a whole country
that triggers
retaliation.

27:10.328 --> 27:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we are seeing is a very
careful and meticulous
review of all the tools they
have available

27:15.533 --> 27:21.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to use those to start
bringing cases against
countries under existing law
that they think

27:21.706 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are unfair.

27:23.608 --> 27:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that doesn't look like a
trade war, but
it could look like a lot of
border skirmishes

27:27.779 --> 27:28.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that add up.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still don't know, though,
what the end
result is.

27:31.716 --> 27:35.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason we have things like
NAFTA and the
World Health Organization is so
that, when

27:36.021 --> 27:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a dispute like this, as
there always
will be, it's contained, you
don't get an

27:40.325 --> 27:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
escalating tit-for-tat spiral.

27:42.761 --> 27:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the real test will be, if
Canada takes
this to a panel with NAFTA or
the WTO, and

27:48.433 --> 27:51.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wins, will the Trump
administration abide
by that ruling?

27:51.269 --> 27:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, we have
seen a lot
of instances where the president
has talked

27:54.272 --> 27:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very tough standing on the
sidelines, and
then, when push comes to shove
and he gets

27:59.811 --> 28:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close with foreign leaders, or
starts these
negotiations, he becomes a
little more conciliatory.

28:05.483 --> 28:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's say a trade war or a trade
fight really
does break out.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think he will escalate or
de-escalate?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG IP: At this point, it's
impossible to
say, and I think it would be
unwise for us

28:13.825 --> 28:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to speculate too far, because I
don't think
they really know.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we know this much
about Trump
so far: He believes he's a
deal-maker.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He likes to bargain.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of bargaining is that you
talk really
tough.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You ask for the moon, you settle
for the topsoil.

28:26.404 --> 28:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says -- he beats up on the
Mexicans, he
beats up on the Canadians, but
the point is

28:30.542 --> 28:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to abrogate the treaty and
have the two
of us basically putting up walls
and blocking

28:34.813 --> 28:36.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trucks at the border.

28:36.181 --> 28:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's to come up with a deal that
both sides
feel they can live with.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that's probably
where we're
going to end up.

28:41.953 --> 28:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Trump has people
working for
him who are ultimately
deal-makers.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Canadians are the same
way.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're grownups about this.

28:50.028 --> 28:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why you saw the prime
minister of Canada
not respond to Trump with the
same rhetoric,

28:53.865 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but to talk about the strength
of the relationship
and the desire for a deal.

28:57.168 --> 29:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
has also said,
as we touched on a little bit,
that he wants

29:01.206 --> 29:02.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to renegotiate NAFTA.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How would that actually look?

29:04.309 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could that unfold?

29:05.877 --> 29:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What likely might we see?

29:07.679 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG IP: So, I think one of the
interesting
things is that this dispute did
erupt while

29:10.882 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that renegotiation is under way.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilbur Ross, taking questions
from the press
today, said he had actually
preferred to have

29:16.221 --> 29:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept those things separate,
because, as we
discussing a minute ago, this
softwood lumber

29:21.259 --> 29:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dispute is a very old dispute
that almost
follows a dynamic entirely of
its own that

29:25.764 --> 29:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually somewhat independent
of the issues
of the issues that are bothering
the president

29:28.867 --> 29:30.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on NAFTA.

29:30.668 --> 29:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, because they
could not get
an agreement within the
legislative window,

29:35.373 --> 29:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it will end up getting sucked
into that agreement.

29:38.243 --> 29:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very hard to say
exactly how it turns
out.

29:41.479 --> 29:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know from, for example,
drafts that the
administration has circulated on
Capitol Hill,

29:45.817 --> 29:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are a few things they
would like to
change about NAFTA.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would like to, for example,
have the
ability to impose tariffs just
because imports

29:51.923 --> 29:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are surging from Canada or
Mexico, not necessarily
because they're being sold
unfairly.

29:56.995 --> 30:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want the ability to not
have -- to be
able to -- they want more
freedom to use our

30:02.267 --> 30:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countervailing the subsidy laws
against Canada
and Mexico.

30:05.436 --> 30:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will the Canadians and Mexicans
accept that
as a price worth paying to
preserve the special

30:09.407 --> 30:10.441 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement?

30:10.475 --> 30:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will they say, no, we'd rather
have no agreement?

30:11.743 --> 30:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All those things remain to be
seen.

30:13.278 --> 30:19.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Greg Ip of The
Wall Street
Journal, thank you very much.

30:19.784 --> 30:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG IP: All right, thank you.

30:25.890 --> 30:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: About 65,000
undocumented students
graduate from U.S. high schools
each year.

30:33.398 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most are protected from
deportation because
of an Obama administration
policy, Deferred

30:39.003 --> 30:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Action for Childhood Arrivals,
or DACA, which
allows those brought here
illegally at a young

30:44.742 --> 30:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
age to go to school and get work
permits.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump tried to
reassure those young
people, often called dreamers,
again this

30:52.917 --> 30:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week that he doesn't plan to go
after them.

30:56.254 --> 31:02.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lawsuit filed last week
claimed one
dreamer has been deported, and
DACA students

31:02.060 --> 31:03.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are on edge.

31:03.928 --> 31:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza of our
partner Education Week traveled
to Los Angeles

31:09.200 --> 31:13.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and spoke to three DACA
recipients to see
how their lives have changed.

31:13.938 --> 31:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have agreed to use only their
first or
middle names.

31:17.308 --> 31:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is part of our weekly
series on education,
Making the Grade.

31:21.613 --> 31:28.353 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
Twenty-five-year-old Jose
has something in common with
President Trump:

31:28.386 --> 31:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They both graduated from the
prestigious business
school Wharton.

31:31.923 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unlike many of his classmates,
Jose didn't
choose a career on Wall Street.

31:37.762 --> 31:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE, Undocumented Immigrant:
Teaching sixth
grade math is the most
challenging thing I

31:44.002 --> 31:45.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have ever done in my life.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't trade it for the
world.

31:48.239 --> 31:52.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: His students
know he is a
DACA recipient, at a time when
the federal

31:52.510 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government is cracking down on
undocumented
immigrants.

31:56.447 --> 32:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE: I had a lot of students in
tears asking
me if I was going to be taken
away, and if

32:03.221 --> 32:05.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they could hide me.

32:05.123 --> 32:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had students asking me, if
their parents
were deported, if they were
going to be allowed

32:09.494 --> 32:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave with them, or if they
would become
a part of the foster care system
here.

32:13.498 --> 32:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Immigration
arrests are up
33 percent nationwide, compared
to the same

32:19.237 --> 32:20.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
three months last year.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Jose and others, this adds
to the climate
of fear.

32:23.875 --> 32:27.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: ICE has basically set
up shop at
the Mexican grocery store.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are there throughout
the day.

32:30.014 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now my mom is like, when we need
to go to
the store or something, we go
out -- we go

32:33.184 --> 32:35.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out at night.

32:35.086 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: It's hard for me to
talk about, because
I know there might be a chance
that, like,

32:46.097 --> 32:47.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my parents can be taken away.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that just scares me.

32:49.033 --> 32:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE: I tell my students that
they are important,
that their families are
important, that our

32:49.600 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
community is important.

32:51.402 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Of the
approximately 11 million
undocumented immigrants in the
U.S., more

32:55.573 --> 32:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 750,000 have been granted
DACA status.

32:59.811 --> 33:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To qualify, they would have had
come to the
U.S. as children, be in high
school or graduated,

33:06.417 --> 33:08.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with no felony record.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Randy Capps is with the
Migration Policy Institute.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY CAPPS, Migration Policy
Institute: We
don't usually punish children
for the sins

33:14.592 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their parents.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if they had crossed the
border illegally,
they didn't know they were doing
it.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were too young to know
that.

33:20.732 --> 33:25.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: He says the
DACA population
has the support of many
Republican, business

33:25.570 --> 33:27.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and university leaders.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even President Trump, known for
his tough
talk on the campaign trail:

33:31.409 --> 33:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Anyone who has entered the
United States illegally

33:35.413 --> 33:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is subject to deportation.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: ... has
softened his stance.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
show great heart.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DACA is a very, very difficult
subject for
me, I will tell you.

33:45.923 --> 33:49.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, it's one of the most
difficult subjects
that I have, because you have
these incredible

33:49.827 --> 33:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids, in many cases, not in all
cases -- in
some of the cases, they're
having DACA, and

33:55.166 --> 33:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're gang members, and
they're drug dealers,
too.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have some absolutely
incredible kids.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would say mostly.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Trump's change
in tone has
not been popular with some of
his supporters,

34:06.978 --> 34:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Iowa Representative Steve
King.

34:10.114 --> 34:14.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He says he will never be
convinced that the
DACA program makes sense,
because illegal

34:14.919 --> 34:15.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is illegal.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE KING (R), Iowa: If you
reward people
for breaking the law, you get
more lawbreakers.

34:19.757 --> 34:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: He says DACA
recipients compete
for jobs with U.S. citizens and
are an economic

34:24.695 --> 34:26.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drain.

34:26.564 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to a 2007
Congressional Budget Office
report, undocumented immigrants
overall do

34:31.602 --> 34:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
access more services than they
pay in taxes.

34:34.505 --> 34:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But DACA recipients, who came to
the states
as children, are mostly
U.S.-educated and

34:39.944 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far more likely to move up the
economic ladder.

34:43.214 --> 34:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
King disagrees, on principle.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:46.484 --> 34:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE KING: It's an injustice to
our founding
fathers, to the people who have
fought and

34:51.722 --> 34:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bled and died for this freedom
that we have
to simply give it away to people
that have

34:57.728 --> 35:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violated the law, while we have
at least five
million people outside America
that are in

35:02.700 --> 35:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line, that do respect our laws,
that are waiting
to come into America.

35:06.337 --> 35:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: California has
the highest
number of DACA recipients.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's also among of the most
welcoming.

35:12.577 --> 35:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACA students here can get state
loans for
college, in-state tuition, and
even a driver's

35:18.049 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
license.

35:19.884 --> 35:23.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, this year in California,
financial aid
applications for all
undocumented students

35:23.855 --> 35:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were down nearly 60 percent,
because students
feared revealing their status
might put them

35:29.994 --> 35:31.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at risk.

35:31.562 --> 35:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then a media campaign helped
bring those numbers
up.

35:35.633 --> 35:41.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For Yael, a DACA student
receiving financial
aid at UCLA, today's rhetoric
reminds her

35:41.305 --> 35:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of how she felt in high school.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAEL, Undocumented Immigrant: I
wasn't able
to say I'm undocumented without
just bursting

35:46.511 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into tears.

35:47.912 --> 35:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just, like, painful,
painful and heavy
shame that I felt.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Yael came to
the U.S. when
she was 4.

35:55.253 --> 35:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She volunteers to help other
undocumented
immigrants in her free time.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YAEL: I feel privileged to be
here at UCLA.

36:02.460 --> 36:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I think about my future,
unfortunately,
everything seems really
uncertain right now.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For high school
senior Elena,
classes are a refuge.

36:12.370 --> 36:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELENA, Undocumented Immigrant: I
motivated
myself to take challenges, like
honors, A.P.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Classes, extracurricular
activities.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Elena came here
when she
was 6.

36:22.547 --> 36:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has more than the typical
teenage concerns.

36:25.316 --> 36:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELENA: The fear that my parents
might be deported
makes me feel both sad and
scared at the same

36:30.988 --> 36:31.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, sometimes, going to
school, I'm worried.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm like, what if I don't see my
mom again?

36:37.762 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Elena
volunteers for the
Big Brothers, Big Sisters
program.

ELENA: When I was a little girl,
I didn't
really have someone to be there
for me, because

36:49.040 --> 36:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my parents, of course they
didn't understand
the language.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I had the opportunity
to be in this
program, it was like, yes, I
really want to

36:56.647 --> 36:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do it, because I want to help
someone.

36:58.716 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they're in my situation or
like a similar
situation, so I want to be there
for them.

37:04.088 --> 37:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: If President
Trump doesn't
deport DACA recipients,
Representative Steven

37:08.759 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
King says he will feel betrayed.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE KING: They can take up the
task of rebuilding
the countries that they came
from.

37:14.565 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The education that they have
with them, the
language skills, the cultural
skills, the

37:18.102 --> 37:22.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience of being here in
America, I think
it could be a fantastic
improvement, and one

37:23.007 --> 37:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the best things that America
could do for
everyone south of our border.

37:27.612 --> 37:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: But Jose echoes
thousands
of other DACA recipients when he
says he can't

37:33.117 --> 37:37.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imagine returning to Mexico, a
country he
left when he was just 2.

37:37.555 --> 37:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE: Losing my job, losing the
ability to
teach my kids, being separated
from my family,

37:43.094 --> 37:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing everything that I know, I
don't think
it can get any worse than that.

KAVITHA CARDOZA: I'm Kavitha
Cardoza of Education
Week, reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour" from

37:55.406 --> 37:57.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Los Angeles, California.

37:57.341 --> 38:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online, a
special education
teacher in Chicago who has DACA
status remembers

38:04.148 --> 38:10.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the day her family was separated
by deportation.

38:10.488 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost all of us have wondered
at one point
or another about the taxes we
pay: Where does

38:25.903 --> 38:27.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money go?

38:27.772 --> 38:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer not only
wondered.

38:31.309 --> 38:37.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He decided to make the
information available
in the form of a new public
research tool.

38:37.348 --> 38:43.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, Ballmer launched
USAFacts, an interactive
Web site listing revenues and
expenditures

38:43.888 --> 38:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all levels of government
federal, state
and local, all of it free to the
public in

38:49.694 --> 38:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
digestible, searchable form.

38:52.196 --> 38:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke yesterday with Mr.
Ballmer, who is
also the owner of the Los
Angeles Clippers

38:56.267 --> 39:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basketball team, about his
latest venture,
and I started by asking why he
wanted to do

39:01.772 --> 39:03.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER, Former CEO,
Microsoft: Almost
three years ago, when I retired,
my wife and

39:05.776 --> 39:12.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I were talking about our
philanthropic work
and how does one help give
opportunity, particularly

39:12.216 --> 39:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to kids growing up in very
disadvantaged situations.

39:16.320 --> 39:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my initial kind of sense
was, the government
does that primarily, and what we
should mostly

39:22.860 --> 39:24.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do is pay our taxes.

39:24.595 --> 39:28.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My wife said, no, I don't think
that's quite
right for us.

39:28.833 --> 39:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to do more.

39:29.834 --> 39:31.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can do better.

39:31.068 --> 39:34.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it got me kind of rummaging
around in
government data.

39:34.405 --> 39:39.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I soon found that, as good
as the search
engines were, it was really hard
to bring

39:39.143 --> 39:44.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together not just a picture of
what was going
on with disadvantaged kids, but
how all the

39:44.682 --> 39:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money was spent, not just at the
federal level,
but at the state and local
level, not only

39:50.521 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to target kids, but then you
have to understand
what the tradeoffs were.

39:53.357 --> 39:56.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's how I got started
really working
on USAFacts.

39:56.293 --> 40:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does it
tell you that
somebody can't find someplace
else easily?

40:01.399 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER: Well, remember,
we use all
government data sources, so
everything else

40:06.470 --> 40:07.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is findable.

40:07.605 --> 40:11.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to pretend we
invented that
much.

40:11.609 --> 40:16.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, what we have
tried to do
is organize things in some
sensible ways.

40:16.714 --> 40:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used the Constitution as the
purpose of
government as our organizing
framework.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Businesses have to have an
organizing framework
when they report to their
shareholders.

40:26.223 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed that's the most
natural framework
to use for government.

40:31.028 --> 40:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found a few, two to three --
three to four
areas underneath each one of the
preamble

40:36.901 --> 40:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Constitution points, and
so you have
kind of a holistic view, not
only of where

40:41.972 --> 40:46.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money is coming in, but
where the money
is coming out, and at least as
well as they're

40:46.710 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
measured today, what kind of
impact government
may be having or at least what's
going on

40:51.982 --> 40:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the areas in which government
focuses.

40:53.851 --> 40:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say
to people who
-- these days, a lot of people
say they don't

40:58.155 --> 41:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust government, that they
don't believe
the information, the data that
government

41:03.327 --> 41:04.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
puts out?

41:04.328 --> 41:05.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to them?

41:05.729 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER: Well, I would
say, look, it's
the best thing we have.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the best data.

41:11.068 --> 41:13.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's created by professional
people.

41:13.938 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I was in government and
running government,
I think I would use the
government data, because

41:18.008 --> 41:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wouldn't know where else to
look, quite
frankly.

41:20.778 --> 41:25.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if I didn't like that data,
I would work
hard to make sure it got better
and better

41:25.316 --> 41:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and better, whether it was at
the state or
local or federal level.

41:29.753 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People may have skepticism.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not one of those folks.

41:32.790 --> 41:39.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is an
example, Steve Ballmer,
about information that you find
on this site

41:39.396 --> 41:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you think is important and
exciting?

41:41.499 --> 41:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER: Well, I will just
give you
one example of something that I
found interesting.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at homeownership
percentages in the
United States.

41:50.207 --> 41:54.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And off the top of my head, I
want the say
they run around 60 percent of
people own a

41:54.778 --> 41:55.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

41:55.779 --> 41:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might be plus or minus a
little bit.

41:57.748 --> 42:04.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You look at the mortgage
interest deduction,
which is designed, I think, to
promote homeownership,

42:04.555 --> 42:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then you can look at what
percentage of
that mortgage interest deduction
amounts are

42:09.927 --> 42:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to people in the bottom 20
percent by
income, the next 20 percent and
so on?

42:16.467 --> 42:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one might ask the question:
Is the mortgage
interest deduction doing a
better job, a worse

42:22.406 --> 42:25.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job, if it's supposed to promote
homeownership
and savings?

42:25.476 --> 42:29.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because home ownership is the
biggest form
of savings in this country.

42:29.813 --> 42:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Different people will look at
that data and
draw different conclusions, but
that's just

42:34.652 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an example of the kind of thing
you can pull
out of USAFacts and develop a
point of view

42:39.623 --> 42:41.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, does this
project answer
all your questions about, what's
government

42:45.429 --> 42:51.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing for people, or are there
many, many
more questions you have that you
still can't

42:51.468 --> 42:53.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get answers to?

42:53.137 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER: Well, there are
many, many
more questions, some of which we
think we

42:56.974 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can get answers to.

42:58.642 --> 43:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The data is out there, but it is
going to
take more work to pull together
and put in

43:03.180 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a comprehensible form.

43:05.082 --> 43:09.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can tell you, for example,
what reading
proficiency is for fourth
graders across the

43:09.853 --> 43:13.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country, but it would be
interesting to look
at that in the state of
Washington or Mississippi

43:13.657 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or California.

43:15.459 --> 43:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That kind of data needs to be
added in.

43:17.661 --> 43:21.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The data we have is not always
very current.

43:21.165 --> 43:25.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of that is government data
can be a little
slower to get published.

43:25.903 --> 43:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of that is state and
local governments
publish their data, and then
there is a process

43:30.474 --> 43:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today of rolling that up at the
federal level
that takes quite a while.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other quick
things.

43:35.846 --> 43:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, I saw there are several
-- there have
been several other attempts over
the last

43:39.149 --> 43:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of years to set up a site
like this
with information accountability.

43:44.154 --> 43:47.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of those have had a hard
time staying
alive.

43:47.091 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How committed are you to keeping
this going?

43:48.959 --> 43:50.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEVE BALLMER: I'm very
committed.

43:50.661 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- we have a philanthropic
interest,
my wife and I.

43:54.798 --> 44:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while we don't choose to
use, you know,
sort of a tax deductibility on
this project,

44:02.139 --> 44:05.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to me, it's kind of a civic
opportunity.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hopefully, people find it of
value.

44:07.878 --> 44:09.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will stick with it.

44:09.947 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're very focused in on
outcomes for
government with respect to the
amount of tax

44:17.087 --> 44:19.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that goes in and the amount of
expenditures
that go out.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Ballmer,
thank you very
much.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE BALLMER: Appreciate it,
Judy.

44:22.126 --> 44:27.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks very much to you.

44:27.998 --> 44:39.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a novel
beloved by several
generations of readers is a
major dramatic

44:39.643 --> 44:45.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television series, and it comes
riding a wave
of interest, after the election
of President

44:45.149 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

44:46.650 --> 44:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

44:47.918 --> 44:50.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: When they slaughtered
Congress, we
didn't wake up.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they blamed terrorists and
suspended
the Constitution, we didn't wake
up then either.

44:55.859 --> 45:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this world,
America's democracy
and Constitution have fallen,
replaced by

45:01.098 --> 45:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a theocratic autocracy called
Gilead.

45:03.901 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I have to let you go.

45:05.836 --> 45:10.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A place where
women have lost
the right to work or own
property, where many

45:10.441 --> 45:11.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of them are property.

45:11.975 --> 45:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: You girls will serve
the leaders
and their barren wives.

45:17.247 --> 45:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will bear children for them.

45:19.883 --> 45:24.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The so-called
handmaids are
valued, and controlled, for
their ability

45:24.455 --> 45:29.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reproduce in a future America
where most
women are infertile.

45:29.326 --> 45:35.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Designated by their bonnets and
red dresses,
they are kept under an
ever-watchful eye.

45:35.332 --> 45:39.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: There's an eye in your
house.

45:39.103 --> 45:44.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET ATWOOD, Author, "The
Handmaid's Tale":
I made sure that every horrific
detail in

45:44.641 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the book had happened sometime
at somewhere.

45:48.912 --> 45:56.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, think of it as a cake in
which I made
the cake, but all of the raisins
and chocolate

45:57.020 --> 45:58.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chips are real.

45:58.856 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The series "The
Handmaid's
Tale" is based on the classic
1985 novel of

46:04.261 --> 46:07.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same name by Canadian author
Margaret
Atwood.

46:07.664 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She calls it speculative
fiction.

46:09.566 --> 46:15.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET ATWOOD: I get in
trouble over making
a distinction between sci-fi and
spec fiction,

46:15.105 --> 46:21.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but my only point is that there
is a difference
between a galaxy far, far away
and this planet,

46:21.945 --> 46:23.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really could happen now.

46:23.847 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Atwood mixed
elements of totalitarian
systems of the past, including
the Soviet

46:28.585 --> 46:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, and strains of American
life, from
the Puritans to the rise of the
Christian

46:33.023 --> 46:34.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right in the 1980s.

46:34.758 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The novel found an audience from
the start
and has kept it, never going out
of print,

46:39.930 --> 46:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and joining high school and
college reading
lists across the country.

46:43.367 --> 46:46.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Only a very few women
could bear children.

46:46.637 --> 46:50.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These women were called
handmaids.

46:50.040 --> 46:55.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's been adapted
for opera,
ballet, and the 1990 film
starring Robert

46:56.013 --> 47:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duvall and Natasha Richardson,
and now this
Hulu series starring Elisabeth
Moss, who read

47:02.219 --> 47:07.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book as a teenager, playing
Offred, a
handmaid just assigned to a new
household.

47:07.424 --> 47:11.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISABETH MOSS, Actress: And the
glass is
shatter-proof, but it isn't
running away they're

47:11.762 --> 47:13.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afraid of.

47:13.130 --> 47:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A handmaid wouldn't get far.

47:17.034 --> 47:25.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's those other escapes, the
ones you can
open in yourself given a cutting
edge or a

47:25.108 --> 47:28.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
twisted sheet and a chandelier.

47:28.212 --> 47:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I love that the heroine of the
book is an
anti-heroine, that she's a
human, that she's

47:33.717 --> 47:40.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wife, a mom, is a normal
person and then
is sort of picked up, taken, and
dropped into

47:40.958 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this scenario and has to figure
out how to
survive.

47:44.394 --> 47:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She does a sort of thing that
often prisoners
will do, which is, they have to
adapt to the

47:49.366 --> 47:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prison environment, and they
have to hold
their enemies closer than their
friends.

47:53.403 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The series is
striking in how
disturbing it is, both in the
dark version

47:57.908 --> 48:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of society it portrays, and, at
the same time,
its beautiful look, a
combination sought by

48:03.480 --> 48:07.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series showrunner Bruce Miller
and executive
producer Warren Littlefield.

48:07.517 --> 48:09.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN LITTLEFIELD, Executive
Producer, "The
Handmaid's Tale": You recognize
this world.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a beautiful world.

48:11.488 --> 48:13.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want it to be cleaner.

48:13.090 --> 48:15.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want the food to be
healthier.

48:15.158 --> 48:18.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're trying to raise
fertility rates.

48:18.795 --> 48:20.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are all good things.

48:20.097 --> 48:22.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's very inviting.

48:22.232 --> 48:28.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we come into our world and
it feels pretty
good, until you look closely.

48:28.105 --> 48:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE MILLER, Showrunner, "The
Handmaid's
Tale": Dystopia in our time had
been synonymous

48:32.142 --> 48:38.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with rubble and dust and robots
and scrounging
around for food.

48:38.115 --> 48:41.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is just a different
kind of dystopia.

48:41.051 --> 48:44.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't have dirty in it.

48:44.121 --> 48:46.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a terrible reality.

48:46.256 --> 48:51.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I asked Miller
and Littlefield
about working on this series
where so much

48:51.128 --> 48:53.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is about what happens to women.

48:53.330 --> 49:01.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE MILLER: You know, I tried
my best along
the way to shore up that part of
my personality

49:01.071 --> 49:06.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I couldn't change, that
part of who I
am that I couldn't change, by
hiring, you

49:06.610 --> 49:12.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, as many people who were
kind of spectacular
women's voices, either with Reed
Morano, our

49:12.616 --> 49:19.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director, or Lizzie Moss, of
course, our star,
but also our writing staff is
prominently

49:19.256 --> 49:20.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we had all female
directors, except
for...

49:22.326 --> 49:27.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN LITTLEFIELD: Four out of
five of our
directors for the 10 hours are
women.

49:27.597 --> 49:33.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of our department
heads, our wardrobe
and production designer.

49:33.904 --> 49:41.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really built a very strong
core of women
who brought this show to life,
because -- for

49:41.979 --> 49:42.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that very reason.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're not.

49:44.748 --> 49:48.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The idea for the
series and
the shooting began well before
the election

49:48.452 --> 49:53.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump, but, since
November, Atwood's
book has returned to the
bestseller list,

49:53.824 --> 49:57.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the series is generating
many questions
of parallels to today.

49:57.461 --> 50:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISABETH MOSS: There's a huge
sort of awakening
amongst people my age and people
in their

50:03.433 --> 50:09.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20s and younger with what's
happening now,
as far as, oh, wait, someone can
actually

50:09.906 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take that away from us?

50:11.174 --> 50:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a brand-new concept to a
lot of women.

50:13.043 --> 50:16.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET ATWOOD: I think one of
the things
that's happened to them is,
rights were won

50:16.847 --> 50:20.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for them long ago, and they just
took them
for granted.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their interests were other.

50:22.819 --> 50:27.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, suddenly, bang, a
lightbulb goes
on, maybe somebody's going to
take these rights

50:27.491 --> 50:29.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

50:29.326 --> 50:34.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that may happen in all areas
of life,
including health care, minimum
wage, and including

50:34.398 --> 50:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forcing people to have babies.

50:37.601 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's not very
hopeful.

50:39.469 --> 50:43.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET ATWOOD: Well, it's not
me making
this absence of hope.

50:43.106 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:44.107 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you can write
the future.

50:45.909 --> 50:47.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could write a more hopeful
future, hmm?

50:47.778 --> 50:51.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET ATWOOD: I could, but I
would have
to make it plausible, would I
not?

50:51.548 --> 50:57.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do believe that America is
quite an
ornery and diverse place, and I
don't think

50:57.921 --> 51:03.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are going to roll over
easily for this.

51:03.360 --> 51:08.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a totalitarian gets serious
the moment
at which it fires on a protest
crowd.

51:08.565 --> 51:12.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first three
episodes premiere
Wednesday on Hulu.

51:12.736 --> 51:15.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After that, episodes will come
out weekly.

51:15.439 --> 51:17.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have more
online.

51:20.977 --> 51:27.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Margaret Atwood explains
her inspiration
for the blood-red costumes worn
by the handmaids

51:27.184 --> 51:29.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the novel and in the new
adaptation.

51:29.886 --> 51:39.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find that and more on
our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:39.930 --> 51:50.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find that and more on
our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:50.173 --> 51:55.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: Prom season is
upon us, and
for many teenage girls, it's all
about the

51:55.579 --> 51:57.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dress.

51:57.514 --> 52:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For some young women, though,
getting that
dress can pose a real challenge,
and one organization

52:00.617 --> 52:02.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is stepping in to try to help.

52:02.486 --> 52:09.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From PBS station WGBH in Boston,
Tina Martin
introduces us to the man behind
the Believe

52:09.059 --> 52:10.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Yourself Foundation.

52:10.927 --> 52:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: These dresses are
from designers
all over the globe, but they're
not for sale.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're free for teenagers like
17-year-old
Raquel Laskowski.

52:19.836 --> 52:22.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAQUEL LASKOWSKI, Student: I was
like, oh,
my gosh, it's so cute.

52:22.873 --> 52:27.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Raquel and other
girls at the
South Boston Boys and Girls Club
were chosen

52:27.544 --> 52:31.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to receive these beautiful
donated dresses
from the Believe in Yourself
Foundation.

52:31.781 --> 52:35.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAQUEL LASKOWSKI: And I think
that's really
nice that someone cares enough
to donate these

52:35.418 --> 52:37.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dresses.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The organization
was founded
in January by Sam Sisakhti and
is based in

52:40.157 --> 52:41.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brookline.

52:41.925 --> 52:43.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SISAKHTI, Founder, Believe
in Yourself
Foundation: About a decade ago,
I started

52:43.160 --> 52:46.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a fashion company where we sell
primarily
to young women.

52:46.429 --> 52:52.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I noticed at the time that a
lot of body
shaming and cyber-bullying was
going on online.

52:52.702 --> 52:55.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: So he started
thinking of a way
to change that.

52:55.105 --> 52:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SISAKHTI: I work with about
20,000 independent
fashion designers, and I would
get a lot of

52:58.942 --> 53:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
samples, and I used to give them
to celebrities.

53:01.211 --> 53:03.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at one point, I'm thinking,
they have
enough clothes.

53:03.180 --> 53:07.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Sisakhti figured
out a better
use for the dresses, many of
them sizes 12

53:07.817 --> 53:09.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and up.

53:09.085 --> 53:09.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM SISAKHTI: So, I started
going into low-income
areas.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
