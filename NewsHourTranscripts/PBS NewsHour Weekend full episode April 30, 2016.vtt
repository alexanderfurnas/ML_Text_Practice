WERE INCARCERATED UNDER THREE

16:36.929 --> 16:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKES, AND THEIR FAMILIES

16:38.764 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING, "NOW WHAT?"

16:40.633 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT TO

16:42.134 --> 16:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT SORT OF VERY SUDDEN CHANGE

16:48.307 --> 16:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE LAW?

16:49.208 --> 16:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DID YOU OBSERVE?

16:50.209 --> 16:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU GET

16:53.045 --> 16:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED FROM PRISON YOU'RE ON

16:54.380 --> 16:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAROLE, AND THAT CAN BE A GOOD

16:56.883 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING AND A VERY, VERY BAD

16:58.317 --> 16:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

16:58.985 --> 16:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TRAPPED UP

16:59.952 --> 17:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF PAROLE

17:01.520 --> 17:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLATIONS, AND THE PAROLE

17:03.522 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM ISN'T ALWAYS HELPFUL.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN THE FILM, ONE OF OUR

17:07.360 --> 17:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARACTERS GETS A JOB.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S THRILLED TO HAVE A JOB, BUT

17:10.596 --> 17:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS PAROLE OFFICER MAKES HIM

17:11.731 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY,

17:13.799 --> 17:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT THREATENS HIS EMPLOYMENT.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SAID, WITH PAROLE, THERE

17:18.371 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENDS TO BE ACCESS TO SOME

17:20.940 --> 17:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICES.

17:22.341 --> 17:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION,

17:23.910 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THEM ARE RELEASED

17:24.844 --> 17:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT PAROLE, WHICH SHUT THEM

17:27.179 --> 17:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT

17:29.315 --> 17:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD NORMALLY GET.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE WASN'T A LOT OF MONEY

17:32.218 --> 17:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HOUSING.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT HAD TO BE SORT OF

17:34.854 --> 17:37.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZED, AND A LOT OF THAT WAS

17:37.757 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZED BY THE PEOPLE AT THE

TEENS STILL HAVE ABOUT DOUBLE

20:39.472 --> 20:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIRTH RATE, RIGHT?

20:40.739 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT

20:44.376 --> 20:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONALLY, BLACK AND HISPANIC

20:45.845 --> 20:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TEEN BIRTHS AS COMPARED TO

20:49.014 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:50.316 --> 20:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS HIGH AS THREE-FOLD.
