JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:07.541 --> 00:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ, U.S. Secretary of
Labor: If
you work extra, you should be
paid extra,

00:11.712 --> 00:14.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and middle-class jobs should pay
a middle-class
wage.

00:14.848 --> 00:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We talk with the
secretary
of labor, Tom Perez, about the
Obama administration's

00:20.454 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambitious overtime pay ruling,
which aims
to help millions of workers earn
more money.

00:26.994 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Bernie Sanders takes
Oregon, while Hillary
Clinton claims victory in
Kentucky with less

00:33.066 --> 00:36.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than a 1 percent winning margin.

00:36.403 --> 00:43.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: an update on the
chaos in Libya,
as the U.S. weighs arming the
fledgling government.

00:43.877 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 36 years after Washington's
Mount St.
Helens erupted and turned a
forest into rubble,

00:51.718 --> 00:55.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scientists are watching how an
ecosystem can
grow from nothing.

00:55.155 --> 00:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP, Washington State
University-Vancouver:
Anything biological that was
remaining after

00:59.493 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the landslide would've been
completely vaporized.
It was just a barren landscape,
gray and pumice-colored.

01:06.466 --> 01:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:14.875 --> 01:17.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.744 --> 01:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The federal
regulations governing
overtime pay are changing for
the first time

01:28.121 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 2004. The U.S. Labor
Department says
its final rule, issued today,
will be a boon

01:34.661 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to middle- and lower-income
workers. Business
groups say, in fact, it's going
to hurt those

01:39.866 --> 01:43.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very employees.

01:43.070 --> 01:49.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new rule means another 4.2
million workers
will be eligible for overtime
pay. Vice President

01:49.876 --> 01:53.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe Biden hailed the move at an
event today
in Columbus, Ohio.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: We have got to right
this ship, and

01:56.550 --> 02:02.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is a very important piece
of doing it,
because millions of people are
going to start

02:02.756 --> 02:10.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get paid, not more than they
deserve, what
they deserve. And mark my words.
The benefit

02:10.430 --> 02:12.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to be beyond the
compensation.

02:12.432 --> 02:18.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Under the change,
the salary
threshold to qualify for
time-and-a-half pay

02:18.538 --> 02:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes from $23,660 a year to more
than $47,000.
The Obama administration says it
will boost

02:27.714 --> 02:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wages by $12 billion over the
next decade.

02:32.486 --> 02:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thanks mainly to inflation, the
number of
full-time workers who currently
qualify for

02:37.491 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overtime has plunged sharply,
from 62 percent
in 1975 to just 7 percent today.
The restaurant

02:47.501 --> 02:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and retail industries will see
the greatest
effects from the new regulation,
and they're

02:53.140 --> 02:54.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strongly opposed.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David French is with the
National Retail Federation.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRENCH, National Retail
Federation:
By executive fiat, the
administration is effectively

03:00.881 --> 03:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demoting millions of workers
from salaried
exempt employment to hourly and
likely hourly

03:06.520 --> 03:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
non-exempt employment. In the
real world,
these changes are not going to
benefit the

03:10.857 --> 03:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers they are promising
overtime to. This
is really a bait and switch.

03:14.728 --> 03:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some university
officials have
also warned they may have to
raise tuition

03:20.033 --> 03:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or scale back services to abide
by the new
guidelines.

03:24.171 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a statement today,
Republican House
Speaker Paul Ryan vowed to fight
the overtime

03:29.876 --> 03:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule. He said -- quote -- "This
regulation
hurts the very people it alleges
to help.

03:36.083 --> 03:41.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many small businesses and
nonprofits will
be unable to afford skilled
workers and be

03:41.888 --> 03:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forced to eliminate salaried
positions."

03:44.458 --> 03:50.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rule takes effect December
1. After that,
the salary threshold will be
automatically

03:50.997 --> 03:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
updated every three years.

03:53.166 --> 03:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have an interview with
the secretary
of labor right after the news
summary.

03:58.038 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the presidential campaign,
Republican Donald
Trump released a list of
potential nominees

04:03.243 --> 04:10.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the U.S. Supreme Court if
he's elected
president. He named 11 federal
and state judges,

04:10.083 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight men and three women, all
of them white.
In a statement, Trump said the
list is -- quote

04:15.789 --> 04:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "based on constitutional
principles with
input from highly respected
conservatives

04:21.027 --> 04:24.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Republican Party
leadership."

04:24.064 --> 04:29.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's top intelligence
official warns
that foreign hackers are spying
on presidential

04:29.536 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates. James Clapper, the
national intelligence
director, says there've been
signs of cyber-attacks

04:35.609 --> 04:41.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaigns, as there were
in 2008 and
2012. His office said the
motives range from

04:41.548 --> 04:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
philosophical differences to
espionage.

04:45.085 --> 04:50.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word from Nigeria that
the first
of the long-missing Chibok girls
has been

04:50.257 --> 04:56.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found. The military says she was
rescued yesterday
in a remote forest with a baby.
More than

04:56.763 --> 05:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
200 girls were abducted by Boko
Haram militants
just over two years ago. None
has been seen

05:03.837 --> 05:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since, until now. The rescued
girl says that
a few have died, but most are
still captive.

05:11.645 --> 05:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To Asia now and in Sri Lanka.
Rescuers used
sticks and even bare hands today
to dig for

05:17.317 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victims and survivors after
mountains of mud
buried their homes. More than
220 families

05:23.490 --> 05:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were missing in a hard-hit
district located
in the central part of the
island nation.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olivia Kinsley of Independent
Television News
reports.

05:32.532 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLIVIA KINSLEY: Another life
claimed by these
massive mudslides caused by
torrential rain

05:38.805 --> 05:44.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has been hammering Sri
Lanka for days.
Hundreds of thousands of people
have had to

05:44.244 --> 05:51.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abandon their homes. Entire
villages have
been buried. Bodies are being
pulled from

05:51.251 --> 05:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mud. Those still alive, and
still stranded,
are being rescued one by one.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. SUDANTHA RANASINGHE,
Sri Lanka:
We are -- developed, established
five relief

06:01.828 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
centers, and in the five relief
centers, now
there are over 1,300 people,
displaced people

06:08.001 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are being sheltered. And the
government
is looking after them.

06:11.304 --> 06:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLIVIA KINSLEY: With more rain
on the way,
they're putting out sandbags in
the towns,

06:15.308 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for low-lying villages, the
water and
the devastation has been
unstoppable. With

06:22.782 --> 06:28.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescuers struggling to reach
those in some
of the worst affected areas, the
death toll

06:28.221 --> 06:30.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will surely continue to rise.

06:30.090 --> 06:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Search parties
found 17 bodies
before they suspended operations
for the night.

06:35.929 --> 06:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China today played down its
ongoing military
exercises along its coast facing
Taiwan. The

06:42.602 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense ministry said the drills
are not aimed
at any specific target. They
began just days

06:48.208 --> 06:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before Taiwan inaugurates a new
president,
who leans toward independence
from China.

06:54.047 --> 06:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beijing regards Taiwan as a
renegade province,
and has never ruled out using
force to bring

06:59.552 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it back into the fold.

07:01.421 --> 07:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese also condemned a
U.S. move to
slap duties of more than 500
percent on imported

07:08.061 --> 07:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flat steel. It is used in car
bodies and appliances,
and China has a glut of it. The
U.S. says

07:15.001 --> 07:20.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beijing is dumping the steel and
hurting American
firms. And, on Wall Street, the
Dow Jones

07:20.807 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average lost three
points to close
at 17526. The Nasdaq rose 23,
and the S&amp;P

07:28.415 --> 07:30.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
500 added a fraction.

07:30.884 --> 07:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
millions
more Americans eligible for
overtime under

07:35.588 --> 07:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new labor standards; documented
atrocities
in an ISIS stronghold in Libya;
billions of

07:42.495 --> 07:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars later, why VA wait times
are actually
getting worse; and much more.

07:52.539 --> 07:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars later, why VA wait times
are actually
getting worse; and much more.

07:58.978 --> 08:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's return now to one of the
biggest moves
made by the Obama administration
to affect

08:03.216 --> 08:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans' take-home pay. Those
are new rules
on overtime.

08:07.554 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The changes effectively mean
that 12 million
more workers could qualify for
time-and-a-half

08:13.927 --> 08:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after working 40 hours a week.
That includes
four-million-plus whose duties
make them eligible

08:20.100 --> 08:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a higher salary threshold
and many others
considered previously exempt
from overtime.

08:26.206 --> 08:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham interviewed the
secretary
of labor from the White House
earlier today.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Welcome,
Secretary Perez.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why this change? And exactly
what kinds of
workers are you trying to help?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ, U.S. Secretary of
Labor: Sure.

08:39.085 --> 08:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This change is designed to
fortify two basic
pillars of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, which

08:45.692 --> 08:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really the crown jewel of
worker protection.
Number one is middle-class jobs
should pay

08:50.196 --> 08:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a middle-class wage. And, number
two, when
you work extra, you should be
paid extra.

08:55.535 --> 09:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem we're solving
here, William,
is that over the course of time,
the threshold

09:00.573 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that differentiated people who
were exempt
employees, that is, exempt from
overtime eligibility,

09:07.514 --> 09:12.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vs. people who are overtime
eligible, it hasn't
kept up with the cost of living.

09:12.919 --> 09:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it has really, really
diminished its
purchasing power. And then,
secondly, in 2004,

09:19.259 --> 09:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bush administration issued a
new rule.
And they, frankly, took
virtually all the

09:24.998 --> 09:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leverage away from workers and
gave it to
businesses. And that's why you
have workers

09:30.370 --> 09:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working 70 hours a week managing
retail stores
and other stores, and making
$25,000, $30,000

09:36.376 --> 09:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a year, which was basically at
minimum wage.

09:38.978 --> 09:45.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're trying to fix that
problem by doubling
the threshold from $23,000 to
$47,000 and

09:45.385 --> 09:47.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A number of
industry groups
have criticized these rules. And
I would like

09:49.722 --> 09:51.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to address some of their
concerns.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One is the argument that
employees will simply
reclassify some salaried workers
into hourly

09:55.962 --> 10:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers to avoid paying them the
overtime.
They argue that these rules
could then mean

10:00.500 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a demotion for millions of
workers.

10:02.402 --> 10:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, actually, I
just met with
a group of people, the vice
president and

10:08.174 --> 10:15.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I, in Ohio, a remarkable
employer that has
600 employees, national
footprint.

10:15.648 --> 10:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, one of the things
he did was,
he converted their managers to
hourly employees.

10:22.522 --> 10:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And guess what happened? They're
making more
money. And when you talk to
their employees

10:27.460 --> 10:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are managers, who are making
more money,
they feel pretty good about
themselves.

10:32.398 --> 10:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this notion that suddenly
workers are
going to feel diminished
stature, we did a

10:40.240 --> 10:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of outreach on this. And,
you know, that
-- that wasn't our experience.
And employers

10:47.413 --> 10:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a lot of flexibility. If
you are making
$40,000 now, and the new
threshold is $47,476,

10:56.823 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can still call that worker a
salaried
$40,000 employee who's overtime
eligible.

11:02.195 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are still a salaried
employee. The
business owner that the vice
president and

11:07.000 --> 11:12.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I met with, they made a
different choice and
it worked for their workers.
Flexibility is

11:12.038 --> 11:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the watchword of the Fair Labor
Standards
Act and this new overtime rule.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, employers have plenty of
options.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is
another concern,
that employers might cut back a
worker's hours

11:21.881 --> 11:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to avoid paying them overtime,
or they might
just lower wages to compensate
if they have

11:26.486 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pay it.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Could these rules end up
triggering a pay
cut?

11:29.889 --> 11:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, you know, we
-- in 2004,
there was the rule put in place
by the Bush

11:35.628 --> 11:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, and employers
were faced with
this. And I hear this criticism
that they're

11:41.401 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually going to reduce their
wages.

11:44.470 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, then it stands to reason
that that should
have happened in 2004 as well.
But, at least

11:50.243 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the best of my knowledge, it
didn't. And
here's why it didn't then and it
won't now.

11:54.547 --> 12:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the most valuable
employees in many
people's work forces. They open
the store.

12:00.520 --> 12:06.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They close the store. They hire.
They fire.
They go to the bank and deposit
the money.

12:06.659 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the glue that keeps the
organization
together. Rational employers
don't take the

12:13.066 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glue that keeps the organization
together
and then cast them aside. And
that's inconsistent

12:20.340 --> 12:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a sound business practice.

12:22.809 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I appreciate the
concerns, but, you
know, the economy is out of
balance because

12:28.781 --> 12:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many managers have lost their
leverage.
And we're trying to restore that
leverage.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, it's
not just industry
that has raised questions. Some
leaders in

12:36.990 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher education and nonprofits
have also
expressed a fear about what this
could do

12:40.960 --> 12:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to their work force as well.

12:42.762 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, we have done
a lot of
discussion with higher ed. And
what they learned

12:49.302 --> 12:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we would discuss this issue
with them
is, they have remarkable amounts
of flexibility

12:53.773 --> 12:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they were unaware of.

12:56.109 --> 13:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had someone from higher ed
say, oh, my
God, my teachers work 70 hours a
week, and

13:00.179 --> 13:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now have I to pay them overtime.
Well, actually,
that's not true, because the
Fair Labor Standards

13:04.617 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act exempts teachers, it exempts
research
assistants, it exempts wide
categories of

13:10.790 --> 13:12.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
employees.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I heard from a public university
about all
the challenges of compliance,
but they were

13:15.928 --> 13:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unaware of the fact that public
universities
can give comp time, in lieu of
overtime pay,

13:23.302 --> 13:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for these workers. And when they
heard that,
you should have seen them. The
lightbulb be

13:29.442 --> 13:31.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
went off.

13:31.177 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think there is a pretty
good road
map for compliance for folks in
higher ed.

13:36.416 --> 13:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would note this, William,
which is that,
you know, over 50 percent of the
4.2 million

13:43.723 --> 13:48.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
workers who are going to
directly benefit
from this rule have a college
degree. And

13:48.394 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over 80 percent have some
college.

13:50.196 --> 13:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always thought the mission of
higher ed
was to help prepare workers so
that they can

13:57.003 --> 14:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be productive citizens and punch
their ticket
to the middle class. So, you
know, it's a

14:01.674 --> 14:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little inconsistent to have that
mission and
then say, well, hey, wait a
minute, we shouldn't

14:07.447 --> 14:14.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be raising wages of our
graduates, especially
when I see the salaries of,
like, the football

14:14.287 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coach at a couple of the
universities that
came to talk to us.

14:18.257 --> 14:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you pay them five, six,
seven million
dollars a year, you ought to be
able to figure

14:22.729 --> 14:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a way to make sure that the
person who
manages the cafeteria in one of
your halls

14:29.135 --> 14:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can get a middle-class salary.

14:31.437 --> 14:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Labor Secretary
Thomas Perez, thanks very much
for joining

14:35.241 --> 14:36.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

14:36.976 --> 14:43.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Thank you.

14:43.983 --> 14:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Libya.

14:49.255 --> 14:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chaos has gripped the North
African nation
since the fall of Moammar
Gadhafi, with at

14:53.760 --> 14:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least two governments and
multiple factions
simultaneously vying for power.
Now there's

14:59.665 --> 15:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word of wholesale atrocities by
Islamic State
forces in the coastal city of
Sirte.

15:06.906 --> 15:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighter jets flying for Libya's
U.N.-backed
government are bombing around
Sirte, and allied

15:13.613 --> 15:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground forces are pushing back
as well to
stop Islamic State militants
from expanding

15:19.485 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond their stronghold there;
120 miles of
the Central Libyan coastline in
and around

15:26.359 --> 15:32.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Sirte has been under the
militant group's
control since early 2015.

15:32.064 --> 15:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly two-thirds of Sirte's
80,000 people
have fled, and been forced to
rely on humanitarian

15:38.704 --> 15:40.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aid.

15:40.540 --> 15:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
nationalities
of ISIS fighters are all
foreign, Tunisians,

15:45.645 --> 15:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egyptians, Sudanese. They came
in and created
a state of fear and terror for
the people

15:50.783 --> 15:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and families, so we fled. And
they're all
foreigners. None of them are
Libyans. We fled

15:55.922 --> 15:57.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with nothing.

15:57.657 --> 16:02.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now come
disturbing details
of what's happening inside Sirte
in a Human

16:02.061 --> 16:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rights Watch report based on
interviews with
those who left. It tells of
dozens of beheadings

16:08.334 --> 16:14.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by sword, floggings and
crucifixions, fathers
forced to marry off their
daughters to ISIS

16:14.874 --> 16:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters, and all females over
the age of
10 forced to wear the
conservative black cloak,

16:21.147 --> 16:23.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the abaya.

16:23.149 --> 16:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday in Vienna, Secretary
of State John
Kerry announced an agreement to
arm the internationally

16:28.888 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recognized government in the
fight against
ISIS, also called Da'esh:

16:33.626 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The international
community will support the
Presidency Council

16:38.231 --> 16:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it seeks exemption from the
U.N. arms embargo
to acquire those weapons and
bullets need

16:44.904 --> 16:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fight Da'esh and other
terrorist groups.

16:48.174 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it won't be
easy. The U.S.
commander in Africa, General
David Rodriguez,

16:53.846 --> 16:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said yesterday it's hard to tell
which of
many armed groups have aligned
with the U.N.-supported

16:59.719 --> 17:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regime and which have not.

17:03.222 --> 17:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we take a closer look at
those groups
and what the United States is
doing in Libya.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Frederic
Wehrey of the Middle
East Program at the Carnegie
Endowment for

17:12.331 --> 17:17.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International Peace. He was a
military attache
to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli
during the

17:18.004 --> 17:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George W. Bush administration,
and he visits
the country regularly.

17:22.341 --> 17:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fred Wehrey, welcome back to the
program.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY, Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace: Great to be here.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remind us again
how Libya got
to this state, two warring
governments the

17:29.148 --> 17:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same time, multiple fighting
groups.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, ever
since the fall
of Gadhafi, there has been a
governance vacuum.

17:35.087 --> 17:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the country has split
into civil war
since 2014, two governments, two
sets of militias.

17:41.193 --> 17:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is this new U.N. unity
government in
Tripoli that is still very weak,
but the eastern

17:46.799 --> 17:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faction doesn't recognize it. So
you have
got this vacuum. And that is a
ripe condition

17:50.603 --> 17:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the Islamic State to insert
itself, as
they have in the town of Sirte.

17:54.373 --> 17:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how strong is
ISIS, the
Islamic State, in Libya right
now?

17:58.711 --> 18:05.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: The estimates
are about 3,000
to 6,000 fighters, bolstered by
foreign volunteers

18:05.051 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from abroad. And they control
about 120 miles,
strip of coastline in the
center.

18:10.423 --> 18:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how big a
threat does that
represent, given everything else
going on

18:16.195 --> 18:17.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Libya?

18:18.030 --> 18:22.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY: It's
destabilizing to the
country's growth. It's also a
threat to Europe

18:22.068 --> 18:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and especially neighboring
states. We have
seen the Islamic State in Libya
plot attacks

18:26.138 --> 18:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against neighboring Tunisia.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, well,
let's back off
a little bit here and go back to
the role

18:32.011 --> 18:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States. You just
mentioned NATO.

18:36.315 --> 18:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does this mean? The U.S.
was out of Libya.
Then it was in, out. Where is
the U.S. right

18:41.554 --> 18:43.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now in Libya?

18:43.322 --> 18:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, the U.S.
is really
behind this new unity government
in Tripoli.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are obviously focused
on the Islamic
State threat.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, more broadly, the
U.S. wants
to ensure that this government
succeeds, that

18:55.801 --> 19:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't repeat the mistakes
that we made
after the fall of Gadhafi. But,
of course,

19:00.573 --> 19:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first priority is protecting
this government
and then helping it fight the
Islamic State.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's going to be
done through
some training, through
assistance, through

19:09.915 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lifting of the arms embargo,
as we heard.

19:12.084 --> 19:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we also -- we
heard Secretary
Kerry say the U.S. is going to
be arming the

19:17.690 --> 19:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right government. But we also
heard the general
say it's not clear which group
is which, on

19:23.496 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which side. How confusing is it?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, this is
-- it is very
confusing. This is the problem
we face in

19:27.700 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of these states where we're
fighting the
Islamic State. Who do you
partner with?

19:30.569 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of Libya, there is
no unified
government, there is no unified
chain of command,

19:34.340 --> 19:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is no unified army. So,
you have got
to pick among these militias.
And it is a

19:38.244 --> 19:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very dangerous game, because you
don't know
who you are dealing with. Those
militias may

19:41.747 --> 19:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn against you. They may turn
against one
another.

19:43.949 --> 19:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a great risk is that, by
arming them,
we could actually fuel the civil
war. So,

19:48.154 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the general is very
right in proceeding
quite carefully.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you do
that? How does
the United States do that?

19:54.193 --> 19:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, there's
been reports
now of U.S. special operations
on the ground.

19:58.497 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they are trying to do
is assess these
militias, their capacity, their
will, who

20:03.069 --> 20:07.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are they aligned with, before
they begin training
and assisting them.

20:07.273 --> 20:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have got to vet them for
human rights
violations. You have got to
recruit the right

20:11.277 --> 20:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones. But, more importantly, you
have got
to make sure that they are under
the control

20:14.447 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a democratic government.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
should be
done, Fred Wehrey? Is it your
sense that this

20:20.152 --> 20:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a formula that is going to
move in the
right direction?

20:23.222 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: I think the
U.S. has learned
a great deal from the mistakes
they made.

20:27.493 --> 20:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they're proceeding
quite cautiously.
I think the right approach is to
really support

20:31.697 --> 20:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the legitimacy of this new
government. This
has to be a Libyan-led fight.

20:36.469 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that really
amazed me when
I was in Libya was the amount of
sort of societal

20:41.574 --> 20:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resilience in Libya against the
Islamic State.
This was a foreign entity.
People don't want

20:45.911 --> 20:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. The Libyans want to move
forward with
their government, with their
economy. And

20:49.915 --> 20:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so the U.S. has to harness that
momentum.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, that's what
I was trying
to get at, as you know, because
we see ISIS

20:56.822 --> 21:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a factor in so many countries in
the region.
How do you tell the difference
between countries

21:01.327 --> 21:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where ISIS can overwhelm what is
on the ground
there, and where the forces
against it can

21:06.799 --> 21:08.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be stronger?

21:08.701 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Yes, I mean, I
think we shouldn't
be overly alarmist about the
Islamic State

21:11.437 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Libya. I mean, they are sort
of boxed in
the central region. They can
still do a lot

21:15.441 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of damage. But it's not to the
extent that
they are in Iraq, say, or Syria.

21:20.546 --> 21:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bottom line, Fred
Wehrey, what
is at stake here for the United
States?

21:24.783 --> 21:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, I think
what is at
stake is the success of the sort
of toppling

21:30.890 --> 21:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Gadhafi government, I
mean, the security
of important allies in the
region, the security

21:36.529 --> 21:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Europe. It's all wrapped up
together. So,
there is a lot at stake.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Europe is
very much a part
of this. We haven't -- I haven't
asked you

21:43.802 --> 21:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about that, but that is very
much a...

21:44.837 --> 21:46.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:46.605 --> 21:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Right. They
are, absolutely.
I mean, they are directly
affected by it.

21:48.073 --> 21:48.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are reports of...

21:48.941 --> 21:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because of
refugees?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, because
of refugees,
then also the potential plotting
of terrorist

21:53.512 --> 21:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks on Libyan soil against
Europe.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the French are reportedly on
the ground
with their special operations.
So are the

22:00.186 --> 22:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British. The Italians have
really committed
to helping this government, to
help train

22:05.224 --> 22:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that new Libyan military.

22:07.059 --> 22:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is a
complicated story,
but it's an important one for us
to follow.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fred Wehrey, thank you very
much.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Thanks for
having me. Thank
you.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

22:26.879 --> 22:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
Senate races
most affected by who's at the
top of the ticket;

22:31.217 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a region in recovery, the
repercussions of
Mount St. Helens 36 years later;
and the lesser-known

22:38.857 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of Mark Twain, a stand-up
comedian.

22:42.595 --> 22:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: medical care for
U.S. military
veterans, who two years -- we
remember, two

22:49.835 --> 22:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago, the Department of
Veteran Affairs
was overtaken by news reports of
poor care

22:55.541 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the people it's supposed to
serve.

22:58.344 --> 23:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wait times to see doctors in
some places stretched
for months, and some VA staff
covered it up.

23:04.617 --> 23:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of reforms followed,
but now those
very reforms are in the
spotlight.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
A few minutes ago, Secretary
Shinseki offered

23:14.159 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me his own resignation. With
considerable
regret, I accepted.

23:19.164 --> 23:23.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
resignation of VA secretary
Eric Shinseki, secretary of
veterans affairs

23:23.502 --> 23:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a decorated former chief of
staff, was
one of the most visible signs of
a crisis

23:28.240 --> 23:30.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that gripped the VA in 2014.

23:30.776 --> 23:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started when Dr. Sam Foote at
the Phoenix
branch of the VA blew the
whistle on the incredibly

23:35.447 --> 23:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long waiting times for veterans
to see doctors
at his facility. Dr. Foote told
reporters,

23:40.452 --> 23:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Gwen Ifill, that the
hospital's
director manipulated the data to
make the

23:44.490 --> 23:46.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waits seem much shorter.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SAM FOOTE, Former Director,
Phoenix VA
Health Care System: We were
doing pretty well

23:48.227 --> 23:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until about 2010, and then the
demand just
ramped up. And rather than own
up to the problem,

23:54.099 --> 23:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the VA decided to cover it up,
because there's
no incentive for Washington to
get good numbers.

23:58.771 --> 24:03.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The VA
inspector general
found that Phoenix-area veterans
seeking care

24:03.108 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to wait an average of 115
days, almost
four months, for a first
appointment. And

24:08.881 --> 24:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,700 veterans were kept off any
official
waiting list, and were at risk
of being lost

24:14.553 --> 24:16.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or forgotten.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other investigations found this
type of problem
existed at many VA hospitals
throughout the

24:19.391 --> 24:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States. The president and
Congress
vowed to fix the problem. One of
the reforms

24:24.663 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorized veterans to go to
doctors in private
practice if they couldn't get
timely appointments

24:30.336 --> 24:32.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the VA.

24:32.104 --> 24:36.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, according to recent
reports, the wait
times with the new system are
just as long

24:36.075 --> 24:39.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as they were before the reforms
were implemented.

24:39.211 --> 24:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with me now to tell us about
this new
system, but plagued by old
problems, is Quil

24:43.315 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lawrence. He covers veteran
issues at NPR.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Quil, this was supposed to
be the fix.
Why is the fix broken?

24:49.388 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIL LAWRENCE, National Public
Radio: Well,
it goes back to that moment of
scandal. There

24:53.092 --> 24:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a sense of urgency in
Congress. And some
political rivals, Jeff Miller,
Republican

24:58.130 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Florida, and Bernie Sanders
of Vermont,
who is now much better known,
from opposite

25:03.635 --> 25:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ends of the spectrum came
together with this
plan to get all of these
veterans, this backlog

25:08.540 --> 25:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were waiting for care, to
see private
doctors.

25:11.610 --> 25:16.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was supposed to be a simple
plan. With
a card, they could go and use --
it seemed

25:16.115 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at first that they would just be
able to go
into a private clinic and
present this card

25:20.252 --> 25:21.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and get care.

25:21.954 --> 25:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what was given to the VA was
a law to
set up a whole new network to
get care for

25:28.193 --> 25:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who had been waiting 30
days or was
40 miles away from a VA clinic.
And Congress

25:33.399 --> 25:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave the VA just 90 days to set
this up. They
tried to -- they first thought
they might

25:39.004 --> 25:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to do it themselves,
decided they
needed to go outside to get some
private contractors

25:44.777 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to set up the system more
quickly.

25:48.247 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And only two of the 57 companies
they approached
to try and do this were willing
to give it

25:53.585 --> 25:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a shot. The result has been
really just an
extra layer of bureaucracy that
a lot of veterans

25:59.792 --> 26:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell me makes them wait even
more than they
were waiting before or just as
much. Wait

26:04.329 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
times haven't gone down.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, give me
some examples.

26:07.433 --> 26:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and other public media
reporters around
the country have been talking to
some of these

26:09.735 --> 26:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people impacted by this. What
happens to them
and what is their process like?

26:14.473 --> 26:16.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIL LAWRENCE: Sure.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, NPR is cooperating with
member stations
around the country. We have been
looking into

26:18.710 --> 26:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this for several months. I went
down to Pennsylvania
and talked to Bishop Small. He's
a Navy veteran

26:25.083 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has some terrible chronic
pain issues
in his legs.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had been trying to get
physical therapy
for awhile. When are you in this
much pain,

26:31.824 --> 26:37.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it can sometimes cause
depression. He hasn't
been able to find work. And he
thought the

26:37.496 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choice Program would be perfect
for him. He
had been told that it was going
to take him

26:40.532 --> 26:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 30 days to get an
appointment at
his local VA.

26:44.136 --> 26:48.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And after calling the
third-party companies,
calling and calling and calling,
the first

26:48.907 --> 26:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place they sent him to informed
him they were
no longer participating in the
Choice Program.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of the problems they
have had.
They can't seem to set up a
network. And the

26:56.682 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
network participants are getting
paid so slowly
that some of them drop out. They
just don't

27:02.321 --> 27:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to participate in the Vets
Choice Program
anymore.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, the
doctors aren't getting
paid, and perhaps that is a
reflection on

27:07.659 --> 27:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how quickly they are calling
these folks back.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIL LAWRENCE: Right.

27:11.964 --> 27:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, we spoke to another veteran
in Montana,
Tony Lapinski. He's an Air Force
veteran.

27:17.069 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was also just waiting
around. He had
a growth in his spine. He didn't
know what

27:21.473 --> 27:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was. He thought it might be
nothing, thought
it could be the sort of thing a
doctor would

27:25.511 --> 27:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell him later, well, this is
cancer. If you
had come to us sooner, we could
have done

27:30.649 --> 27:32.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

27:32.484 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he finally was able to see
a specialist,
he found out that the VA wasn't
paying these

27:38.457 --> 27:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people on time. And this has
caused another
knock-on problem with this
program, is that

27:43.695 --> 27:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some veterans, when their
providers don't
get paid by the VA, these
providers try and

27:48.133 --> 27:49.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill the veterans.

27:49.935 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And hundreds of vets have had
their credit
ratings slashed because the VA
isn't paying

27:54.439 --> 27:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the doctors who gave them care.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
what happens
now? Clearly, trying to set up
an entire health

27:59.845 --> 28:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care network in 90 days, we
should maybe learn
from that. But what are members
of Congress

28:04.449 --> 28:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to do? Are there any new
reform efforts
to try to fix the fix?

28:07.553 --> 28:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIL LAWRENCE: Yes, there are
efforts under
way to consolidate all the VA's
many programs

28:13.058 --> 28:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for care outside the VA system.

28:16.261 --> 28:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are happening now. There
had been a
goal to get them done by
Memorial Day. I'm

28:20.265 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now hearing that is unlikely.
But there is
also a lot of resentment in
Congress among

28:25.070 --> 28:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who drafted this that the
VA hasn't
moved quickly enough on it, that
it's now

28:28.974 --> 28:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year-and-a-half in, and it is
still not
really delivering on what it
promised to be.

28:35.013 --> 28:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
veterans
themselves? It seems that
getting care, after

28:39.918 --> 28:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they have been through, and
the delay
after delay after delay, maybe
contributes

28:44.890 --> 28:49.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to even more problems of
depression or perhaps
worse health care outcomes
because they couldn't

28:49.661 --> 28:50.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see someone soon enough.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIL LAWRENCE: Sure.

28:52.831 --> 28:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I should say I have spoken
to some vets
who use this program and had no
problem with

28:56.301 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. But we have also just heard
loads of complications.
We talked to a veteran in San
Diego, a Navy

29:04.610 --> 29:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veteran named Amanda Wirtz. And
she said she
was in so much pain from
complications related

29:10.248 --> 29:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a tumor this January, that
she was near
suicidal.

29:14.019 --> 29:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She tried to get an appointment
through Veterans
Choice, and the best they could
do was give

29:18.090 --> 29:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her an appointment two months
out. We found
that some veterans are actually
trying the

29:22.127 --> 29:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choice Program, and then it
takes so long
that thousands and thousands of
them are returning

29:26.999 --> 29:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the VA and just saying, well,
the appointment
I would get here would be
faster.

29:31.837 --> 29:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, wait times at the VA
are worse than
they were when this program
started. They

29:36.541 --> 29:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that's because of a huge
influx of demand.
But the assessments, outside
assessments of

29:41.480 --> 29:43.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this program are that it just
hasn't moved
the needle.

29:43.749 --> 29:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Quil Lawrence
of NPR, thanks so much.

29:47.619 --> 29:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUIL LAWRENCE: Thank you.

29:53.825 --> 30:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of the three
remaining candidates
for president, only Democrat
Bernie Sanders

30:01.533 --> 30:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was on the campaign trail today,
this the
day after two Democratic
primaries.

30:06.938 --> 30:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Kentucky, an official winner
has still
not been called, but Hillary
Clinton holds

30:12.044 --> 30:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a razor-thin lead over Sanders.
The Vermont
senator did win in Oregon, but
he remains

30:17.749 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the underdog for the party's
presidential
nomination.

30:20.819 --> 30:27.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drawn-out primary battle is
sparking tensions
between Sanders himself and
party leaders,

30:27.159 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an issue he tackled last night
during a stop
outside Los Angeles.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
The Democratic Party is going to
have to make

30:32.564 --> 30:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very, very profound and
important decision.
It can do the right thing, and
open its doors,

30:37.703 --> 30:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and welcome into the party
people who are
prepared to fight for real
economic and social

30:47.045 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

30:49.481 --> 30:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I say to
the leadership
of the Democratic Party, open
the doors. Let

30:58.690 --> 31:00.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the people in.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:02.360 --> 31:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
presumptive Republican
nominee Donald Trump, who easily
won Oregon's

31:08.200 --> 31:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOP primary, held a highly
publicized meeting
today with former Secretary of
State Henry

31:14.005 --> 31:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kissinger, that on top of the
names that his
campaign unveiled today of
potential Supreme

31:19.544 --> 31:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court nominees in a potential
Trump presidency.

31:23.515 --> 31:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also discussed what's behind
his sharp
tone that he often takes on the
trail in an

31:28.453 --> 31:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interview last night with FOX's
Megyn Kelly.

31:31.189 --> 31:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I have been saying during this
whole campaign

31:33.759 --> 31:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I'm a counterpuncher. You
understand
that. I'm responding.

31:37.095 --> 31:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I then respond times maybe
10. I don't
know. I mean, I respond pretty
strongly. But

31:43.702 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in just about all cases, I have
been responding
to what they did to me. So, it's
not a one-way

31:49.007 --> 31:50.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
street.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And while the
contest for president
gets most of the attention, it
could also

31:54.513 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a ripple effect down the
ballot. There
are 34 U.S. Senate seats up for
grabs this

31:59.751 --> 32:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election cycle, and, of those,
seven are considered
now a toss-up.

32:04.790 --> 32:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These include the open contests
in Nevada
and Florida, where Harry Reid
and Marco Rubio

32:10.162 --> 32:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have announced they're not
seeking reelection.

32:12.564 --> 32:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To discuss all this, we're
joined by Stuart
Rothenberg, founding editor and
publisher

32:17.435 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of The Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales
Political Report.
And David Wasserman. He's the
House editor

32:23.241 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for The Cook Political Report.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political
Report: Thanks,

32:28.647 --> 32:29.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Stu, let me
start with
you.

32:31.449 --> 32:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us why it matters who has
a majority
in the Congress. We spend so
much time on

32:34.619 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the presidential race.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right. We
have spent so
much time covering the race and
talking about

32:38.757 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the race.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you get down to it,
after the election
is over, the president is going
to have to

32:43.929 --> 32:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work with the House and the
Senate if they're
going to deal with any
fundamental issues.

32:48.466 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have had a hard time on
big issues
like tax reform, immigration and
the like

32:54.072 --> 32:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the Congress and the
president haven't
worked well.

32:56.508 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, knowing what is going on in
Senate races
and the House, who is getting
elected, I think

33:01.713 --> 33:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it tells us something about what
is going
to happen after the November
elections in

33:05.417 --> 33:07.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the next Congress.

33:07.185 --> 33:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about both
the House and the Senate and
start with the

33:11.489 --> 33:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate. But, Stu, I'm going to
focus on that
with you.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We listed, what, 34 seats are
up.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year, seven
considered
toss-ups. Is there some rhyme or
reason to

33:23.401 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those that are most vulnerable?
Where are
they? Who are they?

33:25.971 --> 33:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, most of
these -- most
of these seats are Republican
seats.

33:29.207 --> 33:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, 24 of the 34 seats are
Republican
seats. These are Republican
seats, Republicans

33:34.412 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were elected six years ago.
That makes
them the class of 2010, if you
remember that

33:38.650 --> 33:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, Judy. And I know you
do. That was
the first Obama midterm. Voters
were angry,

33:43.755 --> 33:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustrated. Many Republicans
thought the president
had gone too far too fast. And
they wanted

33:47.525 --> 33:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to send a message, send a
message to Barack
Obama by electing Republicans to
the Senate.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they did that in many swing
states and
even one Democratic state,
Illinois, where

33:55.901 --> 33:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Kirk won in a surprising
election just
because of the contest.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now they are
coming back.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And now
they're up, in
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New
Hampshire, Ohio.

34:04.109 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are all swing states. And
given the
polarization of the country and
the polarization

34:09.347 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in these states, it's not
surprising. When
you get swing states, you get
competitive

34:14.052 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elections.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Dave
Wasserman, give us
a big picture of the House of
Representatives.

34:18.356 --> 34:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got 435 seats in the
House. How many
of those are considered
vulnerable, up for

34:25.563 --> 34:27.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grabs?

34:27.365 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WASSERMAN, The Cook
Political Report:
Well, today, we only consider 36
districts

34:29.267 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be competitive. And really
Democrats need
30 to get a majority. Right now,
Republicans

34:36.107 --> 34:41.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have a 247-to-188-seat
advantage. That is
the largest majority they have
had since 1928,

34:41.913 --> 34:43.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
since Herbert Hoover was
elected.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question is whether
Democrats can
really tie Republican incumbents
and candidates

34:47.352 --> 34:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Donald Trump. And that is
easier said than
done. Last fall, we were talking
about both

34:53.224 --> 34:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party leaders suggesting major
seats in jeopardy
for Republicans if Trump were
the nominee.

34:57.662 --> 35:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now both parties are taking a
more cautious
approach, because, after all,
Trump, he doesn't

35:01.566 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a coherent ideology.

35:03.535 --> 35:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't have a voting record.
A lot of
Democrats are saying now that
they might have

35:07.138 --> 35:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had an easier time running
against Cruz, because
at least they have that playbook
written.

35:10.976 --> 35:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in other
words, it's not
as clear that he is the
automatic detriment

35:16.648 --> 35:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for some of these Republicans;
is that what
you are saying?

35:18.883 --> 35:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WASSERMAN: That's true.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, and I think Democrats will
pick up seats.
They could pick up somewhere
between 10 and

35:23.822 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15 seats if the elections were
held, let's
say, next Tuesday. Those next 15
to 20 seats

35:28.593 --> 35:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get really hard for Democrats to
pick up,
because not only have filing
deadlines passed

35:34.199 --> 35:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a majority of districts, so
Democrats didn't
have the opportunity to convince
candidates

35:39.137 --> 35:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get into some of these races
against Republicans.

35:41.373 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also Republicans have a huge
advantage
in terms of having drawn the
lines in 2010.

35:46.311 --> 35:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there really aren't a vast
number of targets.
If there are any targets for
Democrats, it's

35:51.116 --> 35:56.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
districts with high Latino
shares, where you
could see a spike in turnout
against Trump,

35:56.488 --> 36:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or districts with high levels of
well-educated
voters, where Trump could
perform unusually

36:01.559 --> 36:02.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poorly for a Republican.

36:02.894 --> 36:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And let's pick
up...

36:03.928 --> 36:04.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:04.763 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, yes, go
ahead.

36:06.664 --> 36:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I believe
there are 26
districts where there are a
Republican congressman

36:11.069 --> 36:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who just was carried by Barack
Obama.

36:14.172 --> 36:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are five, on the other
hand, five Democrats
sitting in Romney districts. So
the Republicans

36:19.978 --> 36:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have much greater risk. There
are more Republicans
sitting in what ostensibly are
swing Democratic

36:25.150 --> 36:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
districts, but not enough so the
Democrats
have an easy chance of picking
up 30 seats.

36:30.822 --> 36:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, back to the
Senate for
a moment, Stu, is there a
pattern here? We

36:36.394 --> 36:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that each member is running
on his or
her -- or each senator running
on his or her

36:39.431 --> 36:41.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own record.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes. Well,
they are going
to try to run on their own
record.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how much of
it is there
a Trump effect are you seeing?

36:45.236 --> 36:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I
think, since so
many of these are swing states
-- Illinois

36:48.206 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a heavily Democratic state.
Mark Kirk got
elected because of unusual
circumstances,

36:52.444 --> 36:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so he is a little different.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Florida, New
Hampshire, and Ohio are all
classified as

36:57.849 --> 37:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential swing states. And
they have in
most cases Republican
incumbents. Florida

37:02.487 --> 37:04.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is an open seat.

37:04.389 --> 37:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question is, can the
Republican incumbents
here run their own races, or are
they going

37:08.760 --> 37:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be defined by Donald Trump?
And if you
are Kelly Ayotte in New
Hampshire or Rob Portman

37:13.765 --> 37:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ohio, your problem is, every
morning that
you get up, a reporter is going
to shove a

37:19.370 --> 37:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
microphone in your face and ask
you, what
do you think about what Donald
Trump said

37:22.540 --> 37:24.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yesterday?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For House
members, Dave Wasserman,
it is a little bit different,
isn't it? They

37:26.711 --> 37:32.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are not as high-profile,
obviously, on a statewide
basis. It's more in their
district, but they

37:32.584 --> 37:34.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can get swept up in this as
well.

37:34.419 --> 37:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WASSERMAN: That's true.
And it may make
it even more difficult for them,
because they

37:38.156 --> 37:41.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have even less time to
communicate with voters
and separate themselves from the
top of the

37:41.526 --> 37:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ticket in an environment where
the presidential
race is getting all the
attention and it is

37:45.997 --> 37:47.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the main event.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for example, in New
Hampshire, in
the Senate race with Kelly
Ayotte, she said

37:50.468 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she will support the
nominee of the Republican
Party, but she won't endorse.
That is kind

37:55.540 --> 37:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a move of jujitsu that is
difficult for
a lot of voters in New Hampshire
to understand.

37:59.978 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of Republicans in the
House are
dealing with the same kind of
conundrum.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There were some
-- I think
a number of people were
scratching their heads

38:06.751 --> 38:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over what is the difference
between support
and endorse.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
both, though,
about a couple of developments
today.

38:13.391 --> 38:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stu, the -- Bernie Sanders
really getting
into what seems like a difficult
disagreement

38:20.932 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Democratic National
Committee over
how soon he should pull back,
get out.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He is saying
every voter needs
to vote. Is this something
that...

38:30.808 --> 38:31.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:31.709 --> 38:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... have a
consequence?

38:32.277 --> 38:34.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Sure.

38:34.212 --> 38:40.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As the Democratic race
continues, Bernie Sanders
seems to be ratcheting up the
rhetoric. And

38:40.518 --> 38:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the extent that he does that,
it risks
some Democratic core groups
turning out in

38:45.590 --> 38:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
November, since he is, frankly,
unlikely to
be the nominee.

38:49.194 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is one of his biggest
groups?; 18-to-29-year-olds,
young voters. Are they going to
turn out for

38:53.998 --> 38:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton? And if they
don't, if they
don't turn out for her, they are
not going

38:57.735 --> 39:00.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to vote for these
Democratic candidates
in swing states.

39:00.438 --> 39:05.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Dave
Wasserman, the other
story we reported is Donald
Trump announcing

39:05.777 --> 39:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his potential Supreme Court
nominees, potentially,
if he is elected president.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we have ever seen
anything like
this. Is this the kind of thing
that could

39:13.952 --> 39:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have legs as a story, as an
impact on voters?

39:16.921 --> 39:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WASSERMAN: This seems to
be the year
of gimmicks. Right?

39:19.290 --> 39:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz announcing his vice
president before
wrapping up the nomination,
Donald Trump announcing

39:23.461 --> 39:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Supreme Court picks before
even overtaking
or coming close to Hillary
Clinton in some

39:28.166 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
national polls.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most voters, when they
go to the polls
in November, are going to be
more concerned

39:33.137 --> 39:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the temperament, the
readiness of the
candidates, who will bring about
the best

39:38.743 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of change that they want in
November
or the most change, rather than
particular

39:43.781 --> 39:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that they want to see on
the Supreme
Court.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most people understand that
Donald Trump is
going to nominate a
conservative, Hillary

39:49.187 --> 39:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton is going to nominate a
liberal justice.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, gentlemen,
it is great
to you have both.

39:53.891 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dave Wasserman, Stu Rothenberg,
thank you
very much.

40:02.200 --> 40:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Judy.

40:06.337 --> 40:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mount St. Helens
in Washington
state is one of the most
well-monitored volcanoes

40:13.044 --> 40:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the planet, and with good
reason. It's
still active.

40:17.415 --> 40:22.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more than three decades to
the day after
it launched a stunning and
destructive display

40:22.553 --> 40:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of lava and ash, it continues to
transform
a region and its ecology. Even
now, scientists

40:29.260 --> 40:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are still learning about the
aftermath, and
how some life is emerging from
the ashes.

40:35.300 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has the
story, part of our new weekly
series about

40:40.071 --> 40:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exploring the Leading Edge of
science.

40:43.174 --> 40:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Thirty-six years
after its
spectacular, deadly eruption,
Mount St. Helens

40:49.480 --> 40:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still rumbles and bears scars
from that earth-shattering
day.

40:53.918 --> 40:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But hike down the slopes, away
from that jagged
crater just a little, and you
will see Mother

40:59.290 --> 41:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nature hard at work. And there's
a good chance
you will bump into a team of
scientists led

41:04.896 --> 41:09.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by John Bishop. He is an
evolutionary biologist
at Washington State
University-Vancouver.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP, Evolutionary
Biologist, Washington
State University-Vancouver: The
goal of our

41:11.703 --> 41:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research is to understand how
plant and animal
communities reform after a
catastrophic disturbance.

41:17.175 --> 41:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bishop is one of
a select group
of researchers studying this
rebound from

41:22.780 --> 41:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a volcanic eruption. Back in
1980, Mount St.
Helens had given scientists all
kinds of clues

41:29.220 --> 41:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a big disturbance was
brewing.

41:31.622 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two months before it blew, the
volcano was
venting huge amounts of steam
and there was

41:36.794 --> 41:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a series of earthquakes. Even
with all those
ominous signs, the eruption was
larger than

41:42.834 --> 41:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone predicted. It happened at
8:32 on the
morning of May 18, 1980. An
earthquake caused

41:50.241 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the north face of the mountain
to collapse.

41:52.310 --> 41:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP: After that, it
uncorked an explosion
that was directed horizontally,
and leveled

41:57.648 --> 42:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the forest to 13 miles out from
the volcano.

42:00.718 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The eruption
column of volcanic
ash and gas rose 80,000 feet,
while a tsunami

42:07.658 --> 42:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 1,800-degree gas and rock
raced down the
valley at 450 miles an hour, a
so-called pyroclastic

42:16.134 --> 42:17.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flow.

42:17.869 --> 42:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP: Anything biological
that was
remaining after the landslide
would've been

42:21.205 --> 42:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely vaporized. It was
just a barren
landscape, gray and
pumice-colored.

42:27.311 --> 42:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It killed every
living thing
in a 230-square-mile area. What
was left was

42:34.018 --> 42:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
akin to a moonscape; 57 people
died. Some
remains were never recovered.

42:42.693 --> 42:47.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bishop and his team have had a
front-row seat
as nature got busy bringing this
place back

42:47.765 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to life. They wanted to know
where it begins
and how it takes root. Here, it
started with

42:54.705 --> 43:01.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these purple flowers. Alpine
lupine were the
first plants to return. For many
years, they

43:01.212 --> 43:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were pretty much the only game
in town. But
as they went through their life
cycles over

43:05.850 --> 43:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several seasons, they created
soil from the
volcanic ash.

43:10.254 --> 43:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that made it possible for
woody plants,
like the Sitka willow, to find a
home. They

43:16.894 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are how a forest gets started,
but it hasn't
been easy for them.

43:20.765 --> 43:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP: One of the things
we have realized
about these willows is that
they're not getting

43:24.669 --> 43:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big. That's important, because
they create
habitat for birds and mammals.
We have learned

43:29.140 --> 43:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these landscapes are
characterized by
extreme instability in the
populations of

43:35.480 --> 43:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the plants and animals that
colonize them.

43:37.381 --> 43:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In a recovering
ecosystem like
this one, where just a few
species have managed

43:42.386 --> 43:49.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to regain a toehold, even
seemingly insignificant
pests can play an outsized role
in how the

43:49.060 --> 43:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
landscape bounces back. These
weevils are
an invasive species with a
particular taste

43:55.900 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the Sitka willow.

43:57.735 --> 44:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP: Any stem larger
than about one
centimeter is usually destroyed
by this weevil,

44:02.573 --> 44:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the effect of it is to keep
these plants
small, not let them form the
architecture

44:06.878 --> 44:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's needed for bird and
mammal habitat.

44:09.046 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But Bishop says
it's important
to remember we are still early
on in what

44:13.384 --> 44:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be a very long game. He
says the plants
and insects will battle it out
over time,

44:19.657 --> 44:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eventually the ecosystem
will become more
diverse, more stable, and this
will be a forest

44:25.663 --> 44:27.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BISHOP: When I'm out there
working on
the pumice plain, you know, one
moment, I

44:29.200 --> 44:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will look around, and I will be
stunned by
the amount of vegetation and the
number of

44:33.871 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
birds that are present. But
then, the next
moment, I step back and I think,
there is

44:37.909 --> 44:39.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hardly anything here.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're centuries away from
replacing the old-growth
forest that was there.

44:43.781 --> 44:49.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Mount St. Helens
is the perfect
place to test an important
question in ecology.

44:49.754 --> 44:56.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Life does go on, but how? John
Bishop will
keep looking for the answer
here, unless Mount

44:56.661 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
St. Helens awakens and reboots
the landscape
once again.

45:02.300 --> 45:08.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour."

45:08.940 --> 45:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
"Hunger is
the handmaid of genius." That's
Mark Twain.

45:19.283 --> 45:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this latest edition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf,
Jeffrey Brown explores the long,
complicated

45:24.522 --> 45:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tale of Twain's own life, and
how one of America's
greatest writers was also a
pioneering stand-up

45:31.195 --> 45:32.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
comic.

45:33.030 --> 45:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 1894, at age
59, Mark Twain
was the highest-paid writer in
the land, a

45:39.303 --> 45:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national celebrity, author of
"The Adventures
of Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry
Finn," "The Prince

45:44.408 --> 45:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Pauper," and a slew of
other books
that are still required reading
more than

45:48.813 --> 45:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
100 years after his death.

45:51.115 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he was also nearly broke,
after several
investments and business
projects went bust.

45:57.054 --> 46:04.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new book captures what
happened next, "Chasing
the Last Laugh: Mark Twain's
Raucous and Redemptive

46:04.061 --> 46:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Round-the-World Comedy Tour." It
tells of
Twain's travels and performances
across the

46:09.533 --> 46:15.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American West, to Australia and
New Zealand,
India and South Africa.

46:15.139 --> 46:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I joined author Richard Zacks
recently at
one of Mark Twain's favorite
Washington, D.C.,

46:20.311 --> 46:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
haunts, the historic Willard
Hotel and its
Round Robin Bar.

46:24.849 --> 46:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we know Mark Twain had a lot
of talent,
but what probably many of us --
and I didn't

46:29.053 --> 46:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know -- was one of his greatest
talents was
losing money.

46:32.089 --> 46:33.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS, Author, "Chasing
the Last Laugh:
Mark Twain's Raucous and
Redemptive Round-the-World

46:33.958 --> 46:35.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comedy Tour": Extraordinary, a
genius at it.

46:35.893 --> 46:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lost money with the Paige
typesetter. He
lost money setting up his own
publishing company.

46:38.696 --> 46:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he lost enough money to go
deeply in debt
at the point in his career when
he thought

46:42.400 --> 46:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was just going to retire as
America's greatest
writer.

46:45.803 --> 46:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Already very
famous, a lot
-- so much behind him, ready to
glide out.

46:50.941 --> 46:55.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: He was greedy. He
wanted to
get paid higher royalties. And
he was convinced

46:55.212 --> 46:59.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, if he owned the publishing
house, he
could pay himself 90 percent
royalties.

46:59.784 --> 47:04.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The trouble was that he so
mismanaged the
publishing house, that there was
no money

47:04.922 --> 47:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
left to pay him any royalties.

47:06.724 --> 47:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So this was a
point in his
life where he really didn't want
to be performing

47:09.927 --> 47:12.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anymore. Right? That was behind
him.

47:12.430 --> 47:17.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: Right. He wanted
to kind of
a literary giant. And he said --
not wanting

47:17.802 --> 47:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go on stage, he said, once an
audience
has seen you stand on your head,
they expect

47:22.039 --> 47:24.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you to remain in that position.
And he felt
it was humiliating.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He went out big
time, right,
the biggest ever.

47:27.411 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: Right. Right.

47:29.213 --> 47:32.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time a stand-up
comic has ever
done a round-the-world tour. And
he didn't

47:32.650 --> 47:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know how he would be received,
because he
was a little on the tail end of
his career.

47:35.686 --> 47:39.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here he is going out there,
and he is
going to Australia, New Zealand,
well, India,

47:39.890 --> 47:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his performing style is so
dangerous.

47:43.227 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would put a hand like this,
stand there
dressed in an evening suit, and
talk in a

47:49.233 --> 47:52.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very low-key -- very, very
slowly.

47:52.470 --> 47:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. So this is
not stand-up
comedy, the way we think of it,
joke after

47:56.707 --> 48:00.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
joke after joke. This is
storytelling. So
what made it work?

48:00.177 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: The delivery is
almost unique.

48:01.912 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
I think he was a
once-in-a-millennium humorist.
He wrote about the boatman on --
the Arab

48:08.919 --> 48:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boatman charging so much to
cross the Sea
of Galilee, that they understood
why Jesus

48:13.624 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
learned to walk on water.

48:14.925 --> 48:16.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:16.427 --> 48:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, that's a
little quick -- that's
a good joke. Right?

48:18.562 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: Yes. He didn't do
that much
of that.

48:20.297 --> 48:23.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. But he
would spin out
these stories for a long time.
Right?

48:23.868 --> 48:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: Excellent point.

48:25.736 --> 48:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did seven-to-15-minute
stories. He did
90 minutes total. He had three
full performances

48:29.373 --> 48:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
memorized, three 90 minutes. And
I'm telling
you, audiences were gasping for
air.

48:33.377 --> 48:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he's building
and building
and building.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:36.347 --> 48:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: He's building and
building,
and there's drama, and you don't
see it coming.

48:37.281 --> 48:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right. How are you going to make
that work?

48:39.850 --> 48:40.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:40.417 --> 48:42.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

48:42.219 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, so, Australia, New
Zealand, India,
South Africa, give me one place
or example

48:46.824 --> 48:48.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that grabbed you in your
research that you
loved.

48:48.859 --> 48:50.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: It's just so easy
to pick.

48:50.995 --> 48:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
India. He adored the glamour,
the exoticness.
And he rode elephants in India.
And he got

48:56.767 --> 49:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I would consider the
greatest perk in
the history of celebrities
perks. They set

49:01.305 --> 49:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aside 35 miles of the Darjeeling
Himalayan
Railway that he could use as
personal roller

49:07.678 --> 49:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coaster. I mean, who gets that?

49:09.213 --> 49:11.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is very
steep, through
the mountains, yes.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:13.784 --> 49:16.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD ZACKS: Yes, it's
7,000-foot elevation.
They had zigzag -- four places
were so steep,

49:16.420 --> 49:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they had to reverse the train
and zigzag it.

49:19.590 --> 49:25.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Twain goes down with his
family in a handcar,
open canvas seats, no seat belts
we're told

49:25.262 --> 49:29.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, and the only thing that
can stop them
is a hand brake. And some of the
drops are

49:29.133 --> 49:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over 1,000 feet. He said it was
rousing, tingling
pleasure, the best day of the
entire trip.

49:33.871 --> 49:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, one of
the pleasures
of this story is that, while
it's begun out

49:39.443 --> 49:44.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of poverty in a sense, almost,
or trying to
fight it off, he lives a really
high life,

49:44.815 --> 49:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, I mean, only the best
hotels, the cruise
ships, the train trip.

49:49.920 --> 49:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: He is such a
contradiction,
which is I think is why he is so
unbelievably

49:54.491 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funny.

49:56.260 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted to be a man of the
people, and he
wanted to live the most
aristocratic life.

49:58.762 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted to be the funniest
man, and he wanted
to be a literary giant. He
travels around

50:02.233 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world to pay off debts, but
because his
wife was an heiress, he thought
she should

50:05.836 --> 50:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay at the absolute best hotel
in every city.

50:09.306 --> 50:14.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he burned up like maybe a
quarter of his
potential profits on hotel and
first-class

50:14.044 --> 50:15.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
steamer tickets.

50:15.779 --> 50:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he wanted to
be, in the
end, a great writer, right, not
a kind of

50:20.317 --> 50:22.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clown act or anything like that.

50:22.152 --> 50:23.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD ZACKS: Exactly.

50:23.153 --> 50:24.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did he feel like
he got there?

50:24.989 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: I think he had
mixed feelings
about whether he got there,
because he is

50:28.425 --> 50:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always referred to as the great
humorist.
It really irritated him that he
wasn't accepted.

50:34.899 --> 50:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the interesting thing is
that he chose
as his best book to his dying
day "Joan of

50:41.038 --> 50:42.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arc," "Joan of Arc," "Personal
Recollections."

50:42.907 --> 50:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A book that
nobody would even
-- most of would not remember
that he wrote.

50:44.875 --> 50:48.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD ZACKS: Right. He
sometimes said "Huckleberry
Finn" to certain audiences, but
he more often

50:48.612 --> 50:50.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the final years said "Joan of
Arc."

50:50.347 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Livy had no doubt. His wife
was convinced
"Joan of Arc" was his greatest
book.

50:54.051 --> 50:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You had to spend
several years
with him. What came out about
his personality

50:57.454 --> 51:00.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or his life? What did you come
to like most?

51:00.391 --> 51:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: What I came to
like most was
the unbelievable humor, the
ability to rephrase

51:05.996 --> 51:10.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things. "Few of us can stand
prosperity, another
man's, I mean."

51:10.668 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Twain lived at those
fringes. And
he had like an inner battle
between his inner

51:16.473 --> 51:20.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
riverboat gambler and his inner
Joan of Arc.
And it was like -- it was
fascinating.

51:20.544 --> 51:24.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The end of this
trip is where
that famous line that we
remember, right,

51:24.882 --> 51:27.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my -- "The reports of my death
are greatly
exaggerated."

51:27.318 --> 51:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD ZACKS: I love this
story.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Twain is living in seclusion
in London,
and he is writing his book. And
The New York

51:32.923 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Herald reports he is dying in
poverty. And
the rival paper, The New York
Journal, says

51:38.896 --> 51:45.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- sends a telegram and says, if
Twain dying
in London in poverty, send 500
words. If Twain

51:45.269 --> 51:48.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has died in poverty, send 1,000.

51:48.906 --> 51:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the reporter naively
hands the telegraph
to Twain, to Twain's servant,
who carries

51:53.677 --> 51:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it upstairs, and Twain scribbles
a note. And
he says: "Reports of my illness
grew out of

51:57.047 --> 52:00.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my cousin's illness. Reports of
my death was
an exaggeration."

52:00.918 --> 52:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has changed to, "The reports
of my death
are greatly exaggerated."

52:04.688 --> 52:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one more point. He was more
irritated
by the report of the poverty
than he was of

52:08.959 --> 52:12.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the death. The death, he can
handle. Everyone
dies, but that he had died in
poverty, he

52:12.663 --> 52:13.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was furious.

52:13.964 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Chasing
the Last Laugh."

52:16.367 --> 52:18.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
