00:49.149 --> 00:50.517
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.752
FOR THE THIRD TIME IN THE PAST

00:51.752 --> 00:53.153
SIX MONTHS, CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK

00:53.153 --> 00:54.421
HAS SLASHED INTEREST RATES, THIS

00:54.421 --> 00:55.856
IN AN EFFORT TO BOOST GROWTH IN

00:55.856 --> 00:57.090
THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST

00:57.090 --> 00:58.358
ECONOMY.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.660
OFFICIALLY, CHINA IS STILL

00:59.660 --> 01:00.928
GROWING AT MORE THAN 7% A YEAR.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.329
BUT LAST YEAR'S GROWTH RATE WAS

01:02.329 --> 01:03.430
THE SLOWEST IN A QUARTER

01:03.430 --> 01:04.731
CENTURY.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.366
THE CENTRAL BANK SAID TODAY,

01:06.366 --> 01:07.768
"CHINA'S ECONOMY IS STILL FACING

01:07.768 --> 01:09.002
RELATIVELY BIG DOWNWARD

01:09.002 --> 01:10.337
PRESSURE."

01:10.337 --> 01:11.705
THE DEATH TOLL FROM THE

01:11.705 --> 01:13.006
EARTHQUAKE IN NEPAL HAS NOW

01:13.006 --> 01:14.274
SURPASSED 8,000.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.776
AND AVALANCHES AND POOR WEATHER

01:15.776 --> 01:17.177
CONDITIONS HAVE FORCED RESCUERS

01:17.177 --> 01:18.645
TO CALL OFF THEIR SEARCH FOR

01:18.645 --> 01:19.947
MISSING HIKERS.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.239
FIGHTERS WITH A SURFACE-TO-AIR

01:46.239 --> 01:47.507
MISSILE OF THE KIND IT SAID

01:47.507 --> 01:49.209
BROUGHT DOWN THE CHOPPER.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.610

02:06.526 --> 02:08.161
STUDIED AT JESUIT SCHOOLS,

02:08.161 --> 02:09.429
PRAISED THE PONTIFF AND SAID HIS

02:09.429 --> 02:11.365
COMMUNIST NATION IS EASING ITS

02:11.365 --> 02:16.236
RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGION.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.838
>> I SAID THAT IF THE POPE

02:17.838 --> 02:19.006
CONTINUES TO TALK AS HE DOES,

02:19.006 --> 02:20.107
SOONER OR LATER I WILL START

02:20.107 --> 02:20.941
PRAYING AGAIN AND RETURN TO THE

02:20.941 --> 02:23.510

02:23.510 --> 02:25.112
I AM NOT KIDDING.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.113
I AM A COMMUNIST, OF THE CUBAN

02:26.113 --> 02:27.414
COMMUNIST PARTY, AND MY PARTY

02:27.414 --> 02:28.415
DID NOT ALLOW BELIEVERS BUT NOW

02:28.415 --> 02:29.950
IT IS BEING ALLOWED.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.351
IT IS A STEP FORWARD.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.519

02:50.437 --> 02:51.805
POLICE HAVE NOT SHARED ANY

02:51.805 --> 02:53.140
MOTIVE FOR THE SHOOTING.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.241
TEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

03:03.183 --> 03:04.584
AMERICAN WOMEN ARE AT GREATER

03:04.584 --> 03:05.952
RISK FOR CERVICAL CANCER BECAUSE

03:05.952 --> 03:07.654
THEY HAVE NOT HAD A PAP SMEAR

03:07.654 --> 03:09.489
TEST DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

03:09.489 --> 03:10.724
FROM BRITAIN TONIGHT, A POSSIBLE

03:10.724 --> 03:12.159
EXPLANATION FOR THE NEGATIVE

03:12.159 --> 03:13.860
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES CAUSED BY

03:13.860 --> 03:15.529
EATING FAST FOOD.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.830
FOR TEN DAYS, A 23-YEAR-OLD IN

HAMBURGERS, FRIES, CHICKEN

03:20.700 --> 03:21.935
NUGGETS AND COLA.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.170
AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT,

03:23.170 --> 03:24.704
TESTS SHOWED HE HAD LOST MORE

03:24.704 --> 03:27.574
THAN A THIRD OF THE 3,500

03:27.574 --> 03:28.708
MICROBIAL SPECIES IN HIS

03:28.708 --> 03:30.510
STOMACH-- THE BACTERIA THAT

03:30.510 --> 03:32.779

03:32.779 --> 03:33.780
DIABETES, CANCER, HEART DISEASE

03:33.780 --> 03:35.482
AND OTHER DISEASES.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.950
THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE

03:36.950 --> 03:40.087
YOUNG MAN'S FATHER, A PROFESSOR

03:40.087 --> 03:41.254
OF GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY AT KINGS

03:41.254 --> 03:43.457
COLLEGE IN LONDON.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.192
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PAID 14

03:45.192 --> 03:46.426
NFL TEAMS A TOTAL OF MORE THAN

03:46.426 --> 03:49.196
$5 MILLION TO HONOR VETERANS AT

03:49.196 --> 03:50.430
GAMES, EVEN THOUGH THE EVENTS

03:50.430 --> 03:51.598
WERE ROUTINELY PRESENTED TO FANS

03:51.598 --> 03:53.500
AS A GENUINE EXPRESSION OF

03:53.500 --> 03:55.335
THANKS.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.937
THE NATIONAL GUARD, WHICH MADE

03:56.937 --> 03:57.904
ALMOST ALL THE PAYMENTS DURING

03:57.904 --> 03:59.940
THE PAST FOUR YEARS, DEFENDED

03:59.940 --> 04:01.541
THE PRACTICE SAYING THE EVENTS

04:01.541 --> 04:02.576
ARE AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT

04:02.576 --> 04:03.577
TOOL.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.945
CRITICS NOTE THAT THE TEAMS WERE

04:04.945 --> 04:06.546
PAID AT A TIME WHEN THE LEAGUE

04:06.546 --> 04:08.515
WAS CLASSIFIED AS A NON-PROFIT,

04:08.515 --> 04:09.716
MEANING IT DID NOT HAVE TO PAY

04:09.716 --> 04:14.387
FEDERAL TAXES.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.288
THIS MAN HAS CAPTURED THE WORLD

04:15.288 --> 04:17.057
PAPER PLANE THROWING CONTEST.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.925
THE WINNER PRODUCED A PLANE THAT

04:18.925 --> 04:19.993
ONE ACCOUNT SAID WAS PENCIL-THIN

04:19.993 --> 04:22.429
AND FLEW STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.464
IT TRAVELED NEARLY 175 FEET-- OR

04:24.464 --> 04:27.234
58 YARDS.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.368
THE EXUBERANT WINNER CALLED IT A

04:28.368 --> 04:40.247
DREAM COME TRUE.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.014
THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT COURT

04:41.014 --> 04:42.616
RULING ON FRIDAY.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.651
THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT VOTED

04:44.651 --> 04:46.386
UNANIMOUSLY TO STRIKE DOWN A LAW

04:46.386 --> 04:48.288
PASSED IN DECEMBER OF 2013 THAT

04:48.288 --> 04:49.756
WAS MEANT TO RESCUE THE STATE'S

04:49.756 --> 04:51.258
PENSION SYSTEM.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.792
FOR MORE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS

04:52.792 --> 04:54.161
OF THAT DECISION AND WHAT IT

04:54.161 --> 04:55.262
COULD SIGNAL FOR OTHER STATES,

04:55.262 --> 04:56.463
WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM CHICAGO

04:56.463 --> 04:58.765
BY KAREN PIEROG.

04:58.765 --> 04:59.533
SHE HAS BEEN COVERING THE STORY

04:59.533 --> 05:02.169
FOR REUTERS.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.436
>> Sreenivasan: SO BRING US UP

05:03.436 --> 05:04.638
TO SPEED FOR SOMEONE NOT PAYING

05:04.638 --> 05:06.573
ATTENTION TO WHAT THE LAW WAS IN

05:06.573 --> 05:07.674
2013, WHAT DID IT TRY TO DO?

05:07.674 --> 05:10.143
>> WELL THE LAW WAS AIMED AT

05:10.143 --> 05:13.013
TRYING TO EASE ILLINOIS'S

05:13.013 --> 05:15.882
$105 BILLION UNFUNDED PENSION

05:15.882 --> 05:18.418
LIABILITY, AND ALSO TO LOWER THE

05:18.418 --> 05:19.553
ANNUAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

05:19.553 --> 05:21.154
ILLINOIS HAS TO PAY TOWARDS

05:21.154 --> 05:23.056
PENSIONS EVERY YEAR, AND

05:23.056 --> 05:25.559
ILLINOIS HAS HAD A STRUCTURAL

05:25.559 --> 05:28.295
BUDGET DEFICIT FOR DECADES AND

05:28.295 --> 05:29.930
IT WAS HAVING A VERY HARD TIME

05:29.930 --> 05:31.932
TRYING TO COME UP WITH MONEY,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.300
YOU KNOW, TO PAY FOR CENTRAL

05:33.300 --> 05:34.334
STATE SERVICES.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.368
>> Sreenivasan: AT THE TIME

05:35.368 --> 05:37.370
THE LEGISLATURE SAID THIS IS AN

05:37.370 --> 05:38.572
EMERGENCY FISCAL EMERGENCY THEY

05:38.572 --> 05:40.307
NEED TO ACT, IT IS ALMOST LIKE

05:40.307 --> 05:41.541
PUTTING OUT A FIRE.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.076
THEY TOOK CERTAIN STEPS LIKE

05:43.076 --> 05:44.911
INCREASING THE RETIREMENT AGE,

05:44.911 --> 05:46.346
SUSPEND OKAY COST OF LIVING

05:46.346 --> 05:47.547
ADJUSTMENTS SO WHAT DID THE

05:47.547 --> 05:49.082
SUPREME COURT OR WHAT DID THE

05:49.082 --> 05:50.350
STATE COURT SAY TO THOSE

05:50.350 --> 05:51.151
ARGUMENTS?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.185
WHY DID IT FIND IT

05:52.185 --> 05:52.986
UNCONSTITUTIONAL?

05:52.986 --> 05:54.087
>> WELL, THE HIGH COURT

05:54.087 --> 05:56.990
BASICALLY SAID THAT, YOU KNOW,

05:56.990 --> 06:00.794
ILLINOIS KIND OF WAS A --

06:00.794 --> 06:02.596
FABRICATING EMERGENCY, THAT WILL

06:02.596 --> 06:05.065
IT NOISE COULD HAVE DONE THINGS,

06:05.065 --> 06:07.000
IT COULD HAVE RAISED TAXES OR

06:07.000 --> 06:08.101
EXTENDED THE PERIOD FOR THE

06:08.101 --> 06:10.904
PENSIONS AND IT ALSO POINTED OUT

06:10.904 --> 06:13.807
THAT, YOU KNOW, HEY, YOU KNOW,

06:13.807 --> 06:15.475
IT IS AN EMERGENCY FOR THIS

06:15.475 --> 06:16.509
SITUATION, YOU KNOW, WILL THE

06:16.509 --> 06:19.346
STATE CALL EMERGENCIES FOR OTHER

06:19.346 --> 06:21.514
SITUATIONS AND VIOLATE OTHER

06:21.514 --> 06:22.616
PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.351
>> SO ARE OTHER STATES WATCHING

06:24.351 --> 06:25.485
WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT HAS BEEN

06:25.485 --> 06:26.186
HAPPENING OVER THE LAST COUPLE

06:26.186 --> 06:27.087
OF YEARS?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.488
>> WELL, I THINK SO, BUT YOU

06:28.488 --> 06:30.357
HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH STATE'S,

06:30.357 --> 06:33.360
YOU KNOW, SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.261
ILLINOIS'S CONSTITUTION IS

06:34.261 --> 06:35.495
PRETTY IRONCLAD.

06:35.495 --> 06:39.399
IT SAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, PUBLIC

06:39.399 --> 06:41.901
WORKERS HAVE A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT

06:41.901 --> 06:43.403
AND THEIR PENSION BENEFITS

06:43.403 --> 06:44.904
CANNOT BE IMPAIRED OR

06:44.904 --> 06:45.639
DIMINISHED.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.407
>> AND ONE OF THE ONLY OTHER

06:47.407 --> 06:49.442
STATES THAT HAS THE EXACT SAME

06:49.442 --> 06:52.379
WORDING IS NEW YORK STATE, AND

06:52.379 --> 06:54.414
ACTUALLY ILLINOIS COPIED ITS

06:54.414 --> 06:55.215
WORDING FROM NEW YORK AND NEW

06:55.215 --> 06:57.017
YORK HAS DEALT WITH ITS PROBLEMS

06:57.017 --> 06:59.619
BY SETTING UP DIFFERENT TIERS

06:59.619 --> 07:02.956
FOR PENSIONS, SO, YOU KNOW, IN A

07:02.956 --> 07:04.391
PARTICULAR YEAR NEW HIRES WILL

07:04.391 --> 07:06.059
GET, YOU KNOW, A LESS GENEROUS

07:06.059 --> 07:06.993
PENSION AS TIME GOES ON.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.194
>> Sreenivasan: SO PUT THIS IN

07:08.194 --> 07:08.962
PERSPECTIVE.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.231
HOW BAD IS ILLINOIS'S PENSION

07:11.231 --> 07:12.165
PROBLEM COMPARED TO OTHER STATES

07:12.165 --> 07:13.700
IN THE COUNTRY?

07:13.700 --> 07:17.270
>> ILLINOIS, ILLINOIS PENSIONS

07:17.270 --> 07:19.906
ARE ONLY ABOUT 43 PERCENT FUNDED

07:19.906 --> 07:21.408
SO COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER

07:21.408 --> 07:23.877
STATES IT HAS THE WORST FUNDED

07:23.877 --> 07:24.944
PENSION SYSTEM.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.046
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE

07:26.046 --> 07:27.280
SOME OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

07:27.280 --> 07:29.416
PENSION PROBLEMS?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.418
>> WELL, NEW JERSEY, YOU KNOW,

07:31.418 --> 07:36.289
ITS PENSIONS ARE ONLY 44 PERCENT

07:36.289 --> 07:37.891
FUNDED AND THAT IS A SUBJECT OF

07:37.891 --> 07:40.527
LITIGATION RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE

07:40.527 --> 07:42.629
WHILE THE EMPLOYEES, YOU KNOW,

07:42.629 --> 07:45.131
TOOK CUTS AND, YOU KNOW, HIGHER

07:45.131 --> 07:47.901
RETIREMENT AGES, GOVERNOR

07:47.901 --> 07:50.537
CHRISTIE DID NOT -- DID NOT LIVE

07:50.537 --> 07:52.572
UP TO HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN

07:52.572 --> 07:54.607
AND DID NOT MAKE FULL PENSION

07:54.607 --> 07:55.575
PAYMENTS AS REQUIRED.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.409
THAT IS IMPORTANT.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.877
IN CALIFORNIA, BACK IN 2012,

07:57.877 --> 08:00.013
THEY DID PASS, YOU KNOW, SOME

08:00.013 --> 08:03.116
INITIAL PENSION REFORMS AND NOW

08:03.116 --> 08:04.884
THE FORMER MAYOR OF SAN JOSE IS

08:04.884 --> 08:06.653
TRYING TO PUT IN AN INITIATIVE

08:06.653 --> 08:08.121
ON THE BALLOT THAT WOULD MAKE

08:08.121 --> 08:10.056
FURTHER REFORMS TO PENSIONS IN

08:10.056 --> 08:10.690
THAT STATE.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.525
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES

08:12.525 --> 08:13.993
ILLINOIS PLAN TO DO NOW THE

08:13.993 --> 08:16.196
COURTS HAVE WEIGHED IN?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.597
>> WELL, WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR

08:17.597 --> 08:19.566
HERE IN ILLINOIS WHO, YOU KNOW,

08:19.566 --> 08:21.768
IS AN UNTESTED POLITICIAN, IT IS

08:21.768 --> 08:23.503
HIS FIRST, YOU KNOW, TERM IN

08:23.503 --> 08:24.471
GOVERNMENT.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.172
HE WAS A VENTURE CAPITALIST, AND

08:26.172 --> 08:29.843
HE WANTS TO PUT FORTH HIS OWN

08:29.843 --> 08:31.644
PLAN, WHICH WOULD BE TO FREEZE

08:31.644 --> 08:33.480
THE CURRENT WORKERS BENEFITS

08:33.480 --> 08:34.681
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW AND

08:34.681 --> 08:37.050
THEN MOVE THEM GOING FORWARD

08:37.050 --> 08:38.184
INTO THE LESS GENEROUS PENSION

08:38.184 --> 08:39.018
PLAN.

08:39.018 --> 08:39.853
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.388
KAREN PIEROG, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

08:41.388 --> 08:42.322
JOINING US.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.059
>> THANK YOU.

08:46.059 --> 08:53.500
>>

08:53.500 --> 08:54.367
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

08:54.367 --> 08:55.335
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.503
OUR ORIGINAL IN-DEPTH REPORTS

08:56.503 --> 08:57.337
FROM AROUND THE NATION AND

08:57.337 --> 08:58.371
AROUND THE WORLD.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.706
TONIGHT, WE TAKE YOU TO SOUTH

08:59.706 --> 09:01.241
AFRICA, WHERE ONE MAN IS ON A

09:01.241 --> 09:02.942
CAMPAIGN TO MAKE ISLAM MORE

09:02.942 --> 09:05.145
INCLUSIVE TOWARD WOMEN AND GAYS.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.679
HIS OUTSPOKENNESS HAS PROVOKED

09:06.679 --> 09:09.382
CONTROVERSY AND EVEN VIOLENCE--

09:09.382 --> 09:11.317
THREE SUSPECTED ACTS OF ARSON.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.852
BUT HE DOES HAVE HIS FOLLOWERS.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.821
AND, AS NEWSHOUR SPECIAL

09:14.821 --> 09:16.589
CORRESPONDENT MARTIN SEEMUNGAL

09:16.589 --> 09:17.590
REPORTS, A SMALL NUMBER OF

09:17.590 --> 09:18.358
MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD ARE

09:18.358 --> 09:22.896
TAKING SIMILAR STEPS.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.332
>> Reporter: THE CALL TO PRAYER

09:26.332 --> 09:28.735
AT CAPE TOWN'S NEWEST MOSQUE,

09:28.735 --> 09:29.636
WHICH ADVERTISES ITSELF AS ONE

09:29.636 --> 09:31.137
OF A KIND IN SOUTH AFRICA.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.605
>> WE ARE THE ONLY MOSQUE BY THE

09:32.605 --> 09:34.274
WAY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT

09:34.274 --> 09:37.143
HAS THE WORDS ALL WELCOME.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.678
WE CHOSE THE NAME OPEN MOSQUE TO

09:38.678 --> 09:39.946
REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT THE MOSQUE

09:39.946 --> 09:43.249
WAS ABOUT, IT WAS OPEN TO ALL.

09:43.249 --> 09:48.087
>> Reporter: 60 YEAR OLD TAJ

09:48.087 --> 09:48.955
HARGEY IS THE MAN BEHIND THIS

09:48.955 --> 09:50.623
NEW MOSQUE-- A MOSQUE HE SEES

09:50.623 --> 09:52.692
WORTHY OF BEING REPLICATED IN

09:52.692 --> 09:53.626
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.961
HARGEY SAYS HIS MOSQUE IS OPEN

09:54.961 --> 09:56.729
TO NON-MUSLIMS, HOMOSEXUALS---

09:56.729 --> 10:00.667
WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO PREACH FROM

10:00.667 --> 10:01.601
THE PULPIT.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.368
THEY PRAY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE

10:02.368 --> 10:03.369
MEN.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.404
TANWEER IS ONE OF THE FEW WHO

10:04.404 --> 10:05.572
PRAYS HERE REGULARLY EVER SINCE

10:05.572 --> 10:06.606
THE MOSQUE OPENED LAST

10:06.606 --> 10:08.107
SEPTEMBER.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.176
>> I COME TO THIS MOSQUE EVERY

10:10.176 --> 10:12.312
WEEK BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY

10:12.312 --> 10:17.917
MOSQUE THAT I KNOW OF WHERE

10:17.917 --> 10:20.954
THERE'S EQUALITY IN THE GENDERS,

10:20.954 --> 10:22.489
WHERE FEMALES SIT AND CAN

10:22.489 --> 10:26.392
ACTUALLY VIEW THE SERMON FROM

10:26.392 --> 10:27.393
THE FRONT AND WE'RE CONSIDERED

10:27.393 --> 10:31.030
EQUALS TO MEN.

10:31.030 --> 10:31.965
>> Reporter: A COUNTER, HE SAYS,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.366
TO THE DAILY STREAM OF NEWS AND

10:33.366 --> 10:35.368
IMAGES THAT PORTRAY ISLAM AS

10:35.368 --> 10:39.038
EXTREMIST AND VIOLENT.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.640
IN FACT, HARGEY HAS BEEN

10:40.640 --> 10:41.474
CHALLENGING MUSLIM ORTHODOXY FOR

10:41.474 --> 10:46.145
YEARS.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.013
BORN AND RAISED IN CAPE TOWN,

10:47.013 --> 10:47.780
HARGEY WENT ABROAD AND STUDIED

10:47.780 --> 10:48.615
AT OXFORD.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.616
HE HAS A PHD IN RELIGIOUS

10:49.616 --> 10:50.617
STUDIES.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.118
HE MADE HEADLINES IN BRITAIN

10:52.118 --> 10:53.019
LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF HIS "BAN

10:53.019 --> 10:56.189
THE BURQA" CAMPAIGN.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.290
>> THIS IDEA OF FACE MASKING, IF

10:57.290 --> 10:58.558
ITS AN ISLAMIC PRACTICE.

10:58.558 --> 11:04.163
WHY IS IT BANNED IN MECCA?

11:04.163 --> 11:07.700
NO WOMAN WHICH GOES TO MECCA,

11:07.700 --> 11:08.735
THE HOLIEST MOSQUE IN ISLAM, IS

11:08.735 --> 11:10.436
ALLOWED TO COVER HER FACE-- SO

11:10.436 --> 11:11.371
THIS NOTION THAT IS AN ISLAMIC

11:11.371 --> 11:12.372
PRACTICE WITH DUE RESPECT IS

11:12.372 --> 11:13.072
NONSENSE.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.240
IT MAY BE A CULTURAL EXPRESSION

11:14.240 --> 11:15.975
FINE.

11:15.975 --> 11:19.112
IT MAY BE A PERSONAL WISH.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.547
FINE.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.548
IF I WANT TO PUT A BONE THROUGH

11:21.548 --> 11:22.749
MY NOSE I HAVE A RIGHT.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.683
BUT THEN DO I HAVE A RIGHT TO

11:23.683 --> 11:24.450
SAY A BONE THROUGH MY NOSE IS AN

11:24.450 --> 11:27.253
ISLAMIC THING?

11:27.253 --> 11:28.521
>> IT THINK THE FIRST REACTION

11:28.521 --> 11:29.722
FROM THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY WAS

11:29.722 --> 11:31.224
ONE OF SURPRISE, OF ASTONISHMENT

11:31.224 --> 11:32.158
AND THEN I THINK A CERTAIN

11:32.158 --> 11:35.395
AMOUNT OF ANGER.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.296
>> Reporter: SHAFIQ MORTON IS A

11:36.296 --> 11:37.263
JOURNALIST AND A CONVERT TO

11:37.263 --> 11:39.232
ISLAM.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.100
>> THERE WAS A FEELING OF INSULT

11:41.100 --> 11:43.002
AND HURT AS WELL THAT SOMEBODY

11:43.002 --> 11:44.971
COULD COME IN AND MAKE THESE

11:44.971 --> 11:47.106
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF

11:47.106 --> 11:48.474
THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE THESE

11:48.474 --> 11:50.310
CLAIMS THAT THE COMMUNITY WASN'T

11:50.310 --> 11:52.211
OPEN, THAT IT WASN'T WELCOMING

11:52.211 --> 11:56.249
AND THAT IT WAS A CLOSED

11:56.249 --> 11:56.950
COMMUNITY, THAT IT WAS ULTRA-

11:56.950 --> 11:57.717
CONSERVATIVE IN THE NEGATIVE

11:57.717 --> 11:58.685
SENSE.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.086
>> Reporter: BUT IT'S NOT JUST

12:00.086 --> 12:01.554
HARGEY SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE TO

12:01.554 --> 12:02.989
CONSERVATIVE ISLAM.

12:02.989 --> 12:07.327
THE IDEA HAS CAUGHT ON IN SMALL

12:07.327 --> 12:08.227
NUMBERS IN PLACES LIKE CANADA TO

12:08.227 --> 12:09.362
PARIS TO LOS ANGELES WHERE

12:09.362 --> 12:10.463
MOSQUES HAVE OPENED UP SEEKING

12:10.463 --> 12:12.899
TO CATER TO WOMEN OR GAY PEOPLE.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.701
>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

12:14.701 --> 12:16.703
AN ATTEMPT TO REALLY GO BACK TO

12:16.703 --> 12:18.504
DEBATES THAT HAVE EXISTED IN

12:18.504 --> 12:19.839
EARLY MUSLIM TRADITIONS AND TRY

12:19.839 --> 12:21.040
TO BRING THOSE TRADITIONS BACK

12:21.040 --> 12:22.842
TO THE FRONT.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.010
>> Reporter: HUSSEIN RASHID IS A

12:24.010 --> 12:25.144
PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES

12:25.144 --> 12:26.079
AT HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY ON LONG

12:26.079 --> 12:27.947
ISLAND.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.084
>> WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE NEW

12:31.084 --> 12:35.755
CENTERS COMING UP, I THINK WE

12:35.755 --> 12:37.323
HAVE TO SEE IT NOT AS A TREND

12:37.323 --> 12:38.191
TOWARDS WE'RE GONNA HAVE GAY

12:38.191 --> 12:40.994
MOSQUES OR A TREND TOWARDS

12:40.994 --> 12:42.161
HAVING WOMEN'S MOSQUES, BUT

12:42.161 --> 12:43.463
REALLY IT'S A PATTERN OF MUSLIMS

12:43.463 --> 12:44.731
ARE NOW REIMAGINING WHAT THESE

12:44.731 --> 12:46.065
SPACES COULD BE LIKE MORE

12:46.065 --> 12:47.300
LARGELY.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.902
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

12:49.902 --> 12:51.437
IT'S NOT THE TRANSFORMATION OF

12:51.437 --> 12:52.639
THE TRADITION BUT IT IS THE

12:52.639 --> 12:55.008
ADAPTATION OF THE TRADITION.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.743
>> Reporter: EVEN SO HARGEY'S

12:56.743 --> 12:58.311
INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM HAS PUT

12:58.311 --> 13:03.249
HIM AT ODDS WITH THE MAINSTREAM

13:03.249 --> 13:04.350
MUSLIM COMMUNITY HERE,

13:04.350 --> 13:05.518
ESTABLISHED NEARLY 400 YEARS AGO

13:05.518 --> 13:07.153
BY SLAVES FROM THE DUTCH EAST

13:07.153 --> 13:08.988
INDIES-- PRESENT DAY INDONESIA.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.023
MUSLIMS NOW ACCOUNT FOR 1.5

13:10.023 --> 13:10.957
PERCENT OF SOUTH AFRICA'S

13:10.957 --> 13:12.892
POPULATION.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.427
HARGEY'S CALL FOR A REVOLUTION

13:14.427 --> 13:16.763
ON HOW ISLAM IS PRACTICED HAS

13:16.763 --> 13:18.064
MADE HIM A TARGET-- LAST YEAR

13:18.064 --> 13:19.799
THERE WERE THREE ARSON ATTACKS

13:19.799 --> 13:22.568
AGAINST THE MOSQUE.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.339
HIS THEOLOGY IS A SHARP

13:26.339 --> 13:27.407
DEPARTURE FROM MAINSTREAM ISLAM-

13:27.407 --> 13:28.808
- A FEW MILES AWAY AT THE LARGE

13:28.808 --> 13:30.376
GATESVILLE MOSQUE WOMEN PRAY

13:30.376 --> 13:31.611
FROM THE BALCONY AT THE BACK OF

13:31.611 --> 13:32.779
THE MOSQUE AND ARE SEPARATED BY

13:32.779 --> 13:34.313
A BARRIER.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.182
MAINSTREAM MUSLIMS SAY IT HAS

13:36.182 --> 13:37.950
BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES AND

13:37.950 --> 13:39.052
THEY ARE AGAINST WHAT HARGEY IS

13:39.052 --> 13:40.987
DOING.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.590
>> HE DOESN'T REPRESENT ISLAM

13:44.590 --> 13:46.359
WHAT HIS TEACHING AND HIS

13:46.359 --> 13:47.026
PHILOSOPHY IS TOTALLY AT

13:47.026 --> 13:47.794
VARIANCE WITH ISLAMIC

13:47.794 --> 13:48.394
PHILOSOPHY.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.929
COMPLETELY AT VARIANCE.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.798
>> I WOULD SAY HE'S A HERETIC

13:51.798 --> 13:55.702
AND WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO HIS OWN

13:55.702 --> 13:57.537
DEVICES.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.738
YEAH, HE'S AN IMPOSTER.

13:58.738 --> 13:59.472
>> Reporter: SOME PEOPLE ARE

13:59.472 --> 14:00.306
CALLING YOU AN IMPOSTER, EVEN A

14:00.306 --> 14:03.076
HERETIC?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.110
>> I AM NOT A HERETIC.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.044
THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE GROUNDS

14:05.044 --> 14:08.081
THEOLOGICALLY AND OTHERWISE TO

14:08.081 --> 14:08.815
CONDEMN THIS MOSQUE.

14:08.815 --> 14:09.816
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SCRAPING

14:09.816 --> 14:10.817
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.085
THEY ARE ISSUING TENDENTIOUS

14:12.085 --> 14:15.655
LEAFLETS ANONYMOUS AND SO FORTH

14:15.655 --> 14:17.090
SAYING I AM GAY BECAUSE HARGEY-

14:17.090 --> 14:19.959
MEANS THE GAY PART OF MY NAME,

14:19.959 --> 14:25.398
I'M GAY-- NONSENSE LIKE THAT.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.432
>> Reporter: ALTHOUGH HARGEY'S

14:26.432 --> 14:27.366
POSITION ON HOMOSEXUALITY HAS

14:27.366 --> 14:28.434
BEEN QUESTIONED, SO WE ASKED HIM

14:28.434 --> 14:29.168
FOR A CLARIFICATION.

14:29.168 --> 14:29.902
>> WELL, I DON'T ENDORSE

14:29.902 --> 14:30.670
HOMOSEXUAL LIVING.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.004
I THINK THIS IS NOT WHAT THE

14:32.004 --> 14:34.073
KORAN TEACHES, BUT LIKE I'VE

14:34.073 --> 14:35.141
SAID EARLIER, I DO NOT HAVE THE

14:35.141 --> 14:36.843
RIGHT TO CONDEMN PEOPLE.

14:36.843 --> 14:40.513
IT IS NOT OUR BUSINESS TO DECIDE

14:40.513 --> 14:42.181
WHO ENTERS THIS MOSQUE OR NOT.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.116
AND THE KORAN IS VERY SPECIFIC

14:43.116 --> 14:44.150
THAT JUDGMENT BELONGS TO GOD

14:44.150 --> 14:45.952
ALONE.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.988
SO IF THE HOMOSEXUAL OR THE

14:48.988 --> 14:50.289
LESBIAN COMES IN KNOWN TO ME OR

14:50.289 --> 14:55.762
UNKNOWN TO ME WE DON'T HAVE THE

14:55.762 --> 14:57.897
RIGHT TO EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS

14:57.897 --> 15:01.100
GATHERING.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.168
>> Reporter: FOR ALL THEIR

15:02.168 --> 15:04.003
DIFFERENCES, HARGEY AND THE LONG

15:04.003 --> 15:05.204
ESTABLISHED GATESVILLE MOSQUE

15:05.204 --> 15:08.007
ARE ACTUALLY NOT THAT FAR APART.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.144
THE IMAM OF THAT MOSQUE, SHEIK

15:11.144 --> 15:12.245
ALEXANDER, SAYS NOBODY IS ASKED

15:12.245 --> 15:13.079
ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION

15:13.079 --> 15:15.481
WHEN THEY COME TO PRAY.

15:15.481 --> 15:19.452
>> EVEN THOUGH HOMOSEXUALITY IS

15:19.452 --> 15:20.553
CONDEMNED IN ISLAM, MY HEART AND

15:20.553 --> 15:21.921
MY ARMS ARE OPENED TO THOSE

15:21.921 --> 15:23.289
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT

15:23.289 --> 15:24.891
SEXUAL ORIENTATION ALWAYS

15:24.891 --> 15:25.992
ENCOURAGING THEM TO COME BACK TO

15:25.992 --> 15:27.193
GOD ALMIGHTY BUT THE MOSQUE IS

15:27.193 --> 15:29.295
STILL OPEN FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY

15:29.295 --> 15:31.597
ARE STILL HUMAN BEINGS.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.965
>> Reporter: AND HARGEY'S

15:32.965 --> 15:34.467
CRITICS SAY IT IS IMPLIED THAT

15:34.467 --> 15:35.601
ALL MOSQUES ARE "OPEN" IN ONE

15:35.601 --> 15:37.904
FASHION OR ANOTHER.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.672
FOR EXAMPLE THIS MOSQUE IN THE

15:39.672 --> 15:42.208
CAPE TOWN SUBURB OF CLAREMONT

15:42.208 --> 15:43.476
HAS OPERATED WITH "OPEN"

15:43.476 --> 15:47.480
PRACTICES FOR YEARS.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.015
>> THE SPACE IS EFFECTIVELY, IF

15:49.015 --> 15:50.349
YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM, THERE

15:50.349 --> 15:51.217
ARE WOMEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND

15:51.217 --> 15:52.218
MEN ON THE LEFT SIDE.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.288
AND THERE'S A NARROW ROPE.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.222
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN MY HUSBAND

15:56.222 --> 15:57.256
AND I GO THERE MY HUSBAND SITS

15:57.256 --> 15:58.758
THERE, WE SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER

15:58.758 --> 15:59.625
EFFECTIVELY.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.493
AND WHEN I SAY ROPE IT'S A THIN

16:00.493 --> 16:01.494
ROPE AND OUR KIDS CAN PLAY IN

16:01.494 --> 16:02.762
BETWEEN.

16:02.762 --> 16:03.830
>> Reporter: RASHID SAYS IN THE

16:03.830 --> 16:05.198
SOUTH AFRICA MOSQUE AND OTHERS

16:05.198 --> 16:08.000
LIKE IT PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO

16:08.000 --> 16:09.769
WHAT HE CALLS A "CULTURE OF

16:09.769 --> 16:10.736
EXCLUSION" IN THE CENTERS THEY

16:10.736 --> 16:11.637
BELONG TO.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.572
>> SO IT'S ONE THING TO SAY, "OF

16:12.572 --> 16:13.439
COURSE, WE'RE OPEN.

16:13.439 --> 16:14.774
WE DON'T DO A CHECK IF YOU'RE

16:14.774 --> 16:17.510
GAY."

16:17.510 --> 16:19.478
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S A

16:19.478 --> 16:22.181
CULTURE OF WHERE ARE WOMEN

16:22.181 --> 16:23.449
LOCATED IN A MOSQUE-- HOW DO

16:23.449 --> 16:24.984
YOUR SERMONS TALK ABOUT

16:24.984 --> 16:27.019
DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY OR

16:27.019 --> 16:28.221
PEOPLE OF A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY?

16:28.221 --> 16:29.722
>> Reporter: CONSERVATIVE

16:29.722 --> 16:32.358
MUSLIMS IN CAPE TOWN DON'T THINK

16:32.358 --> 16:33.392
HARGEY IS GOING TO GET MANY

16:33.392 --> 16:36.896
FOLLOWERS AT HIS MOSQUE.

16:36.896 --> 16:37.964
THE TURNOUTS AT HARGEY'S MOSQUE

16:37.964 --> 16:39.265
HAVE BEEN SMALL.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.499
>> BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN

16:40.499 --> 16:42.468
INTIMIDATED AND FRIGHTENED INTO

16:42.468 --> 16:43.069
NOT COMING.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.003
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID FOR THEIR

16:44.003 --> 16:44.971
LIVES.

16:44.971 --> 16:45.972
>> Reporter: THE ARSON ATTACKS

16:45.972 --> 16:47.073
LATE LAST YEAR ARE STILL UNDER

16:47.073 --> 16:48.307
INVESTIGATION-- CAPE TOWN'S

16:48.307 --> 16:50.977
MUSLIM JUDICIAL COUNCIL DECLINED

16:50.977 --> 16:52.311
TO COMMENT ON HARGEY'S MOSQUE.

16:52.311 --> 16:53.779
HOWEVER, ITS LEADERS HAVE URGED

16:53.779 --> 16:55.615
TOLERANCE AND CONDEMNED THE ACTS

16:55.615 --> 16:57.350
OF VIOLENCE.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.118
TAJ HARGEY'S CLAIMS AND APPROACH

16:59.118 --> 17:00.720
HAVE STIRRED UP CONTROVERSY--

17:00.720 --> 17:01.888
BUT THEY HAVE ALSO STRUCK A

17:01.888 --> 17:03.122
NERVE IN THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY

17:03.122 --> 17:05.992
ESPECIALLY ON THE ISSUE OF

17:05.992 --> 17:06.993
GENDER EQUALITY.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.194
>> I LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'VE

17:08.194 --> 17:08.995
STARTED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

17:08.995 --> 17:10.029
THIS.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.832
I LIKE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

17:12.832 --> 17:14.066
FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO CLAIM

17:14.066 --> 17:14.901
OPENNESS WHEN IN REALITY THERE

17:14.901 --> 17:15.835
ARE A NUMBER OF MOSQUES THAT

17:15.835 --> 17:16.769
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE SPACES FOR

17:16.769 --> 17:19.238
WOMEN.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.306
>> Reporter: AND HARGEY, HE SAYS

17:20.306 --> 17:21.240
HE'S NOT AFRAID OF ALL THOSE

17:21.240 --> 17:22.141
CRITICS.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.010
>> IF THEY THOUGHT THAT SOMEHOW

17:24.010 --> 17:27.813
WE WOULD SHUT UP SHOP AND

17:27.813 --> 17:28.748
SOMEHOW WE'LL DISAPPEAR, THEY

17:28.748 --> 17:29.815
HAVE ANOTHER THING COMING.

17:29.815 --> 17:30.850
EVEN IF WE JUST HAVE TWO OR

17:30.850 --> 17:31.717
THREE PEOPLE HERE THIS MOSQUE

17:31.717 --> 17:48.434
WILL NOT CLOSE.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.702
>> Sreenivasan: AS WE REPORTED,

17:49.702 --> 17:50.903
THE DEATH TOLL FROM THE

17:50.903 --> 17:52.071
EARTHQUAKE IN NEPAL HAS NOW

17:52.071 --> 17:53.239
SURPASSED 8,000.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.340
PAMELA CONSTABLE OF THE

17:54.340 --> 17:55.374
"WASHINGTON POST" JUST RETURNED

17:55.374 --> 17:56.075
FROM THAT COUNTRY AND JOINS US

17:56.075 --> 18:00.012
NOW FROM WASHINGTON.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.080
WHAT IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ON

18:01.080 --> 18:02.214
THE GROUND THERE NOW?

18:02.214 --> 18:03.215
WE SEE PICTURES OF HELICOPTERS

18:03.215 --> 18:05.051
TRYING TO DELIVER AID.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.053
ARE PEOPLE GETTING IT?

18:07.053 --> 18:08.521
>> YES AND NO.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.956
IT DEPENDS VERY MUCH WHERE THEY

18:09.956 --> 18:10.923
ARE.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.892
I WOULD SAY THAT AID IS

18:12.892 --> 18:13.893
CERTAINLY BEGINNING TO REACH

18:13.893 --> 18:16.062
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING

18:16.062 --> 18:17.363
SOME OF THE WORST AFFECTED

18:17.363 --> 18:18.898
AREAS, BUT STILL YET TO REACH

18:18.898 --> 18:21.801
SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE

18:21.801 --> 18:23.402
MOUNTAINOUS AREAS TO THE NORTH.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.570
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE ARE

18:24.570 --> 18:27.106
STILL CONTINUING REPORTS OF

18:27.106 --> 18:28.841
LANDSLIDES AND MAYBE SMALL

18:28.841 --> 18:31.177
AFTERSHOCKS THAT CAUSED THEM.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.812
WHAT KIND OF AN EFFECT DOES IT

18:32.812 --> 18:34.513
HAVE ON THE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET

18:34.513 --> 18:37.550
WITH BY AND RECOVER FROM THIS?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.685
>> IT HAS MINUTE EFFECTS ONE OF

18:39.685 --> 18:41.287
COURSE WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICAL

18:41.287 --> 18:43.489
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE, IN FACT, THE

18:43.489 --> 18:44.924
NEPALESE PEOPLE HAVE AMAZINGLY

18:44.924 --> 18:48.327
THE RESILIENT AND RESOURCEFUL

18:48.327 --> 18:49.862
AND ACCEPTING WAYS OF DEALING

18:49.862 --> 18:51.864
WITH THESE THINGS ABLE, I AM

18:51.864 --> 18:52.999
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH

18:52.999 --> 18:54.734
EVERYONE I MET, EVEN THE WORST

18:54.734 --> 18:56.769
AFFECTED AREAS, BUT JUST WHEN

18:56.769 --> 18:58.471
YOU THINK IT IS OVER TO HAVE

18:58.471 --> 18:59.905
ANOTHER LANDSLIDE, TO HAVE

18:59.905 --> 19:02.308
ANOTHER BUILDING FALL, IT CAN

19:02.308 --> 19:04.310
BE, I THINK, DEPRESSING AND HARD

19:04.310 --> 19:06.512
ON PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING THEIR

19:06.512 --> 19:08.381
BEST TO SORT OF START OVER

19:08.381 --> 19:09.181
AGAIN.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.249
>> Sreenivasan: NOW, YOU TOOK

19:10.249 --> 19:11.350
SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WHILE YOU WERE

19:11.350 --> 19:12.918
THERE, WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO

19:12.918 --> 19:14.186
ARE BEING SHELTERED?

19:14.186 --> 19:16.355
>> THE PICTURES THAT ACCOMPANIED

19:16.355 --> 19:19.392
MY STORIES WERE ALL TAKEN BY

19:19.392 --> 19:21.360
MATT MCLEAN, PHOTOGRAPHER THAT

19:21.360 --> 19:24.664
WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON THIS

19:24.664 --> 19:25.598
TOGETHER.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.499
PITCHING TENTS IN THE CITY, THAT

19:26.499 --> 19:27.700
WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE TO SEE

19:27.700 --> 19:30.403
HOW PEOPLE WERE REALLY

19:30.403 --> 19:32.638
SCRAMBLING, SCROUNGING, FINDING

19:32.638 --> 19:34.407
IS A ADVANTAGED BITS OF PLASTIC

19:34.407 --> 19:36.342
AND WOOD AND BRICK AND METAL AND

19:36.342 --> 19:37.743
MAKING THESE AMAZING SHELTERS

19:37.743 --> 19:39.912
FOR THEMSELVES, AGAIN,

19:39.912 --> 19:41.213
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.315
BUT MANY, MANY PLACES,

19:43.315 --> 19:44.417
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.052
PEOPLE ARE STILL LITERALLY

19:46.052 --> 19:48.954
SLEEPING OUTDOORS ON THE GROUND

19:48.954 --> 19:49.955
AROUND THEIR RELATIVES, AFRAID

19:49.955 --> 19:51.624
TO GO BACK TO THE DWELLINGS THAT

19:51.624 --> 19:52.425
HAVE COLLAPSED.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.526
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO THERE

19:53.526 --> 19:54.960
WAS ALSO ANOTHER PICTURE THAT

19:54.960 --> 19:56.662
WAS INTERESTING, IT WAS OF

19:56.662 --> 19:58.164
SOMEONE BURNING A FUNERAL FIRE.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.565
I MEAN, IT WAS SOMETHING YOU

19:59.565 --> 20:01.167
DON'T THINK OF, WHAT HAS TO

20:01.167 --> 20:02.701
HAPPEN TO ALL OF THE BODIES

20:02.701 --> 20:03.269
AFTER THE FACT.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.837
>> YES.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.605
AND THE CULTURE IN NEPAL WHICH

20:06.605 --> 20:09.008
IS BUDDHIST AND HINDU, YOU KNOW,

20:09.008 --> 20:12.711
THEY DO HAVE THESE CEREMONIES

20:12.711 --> 20:15.448
WHERE THEY PUT THE BODIES ON

20:15.448 --> 20:16.682
BURNING FIRES AND THEY USUALLY

20:16.682 --> 20:18.317
COVER THEM WITH FLOWERS AND THEN

20:18.317 --> 20:20.019
BURN THEM.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.787
AND FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS

20:21.787 --> 20:24.090
AFTER THE QUAKE THE MAIN PLACE

20:24.090 --> 20:26.892
FOR, WHERE THAT IS DONE IN

20:26.892 --> 20:30.196
KATHMANDU CAUSE PARK PATI IT WAS

20:30.196 --> 20:31.730
AN ASSEMBLY LINE, IT WAS VERY,

20:31.730 --> 20:34.266
VERY DEPRESSING TO SEE.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.802
WAITING LINES FOR PEOPLE TO BE

20:36.802 --> 20:38.237
CREMATED BY THE RIVER.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.639
IT SLOWED DOWN NOW BUT THAT IS

20:40.639 --> 20:41.741
ONLY IN THE CAPITAL.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.275
MOST OF THE VICTIMS, IF YOU ADD

20:43.275 --> 20:45.044
UP THE TOTALS WERE IN RURAL

20:45.044 --> 20:46.512
AREAS AND IT IS HARDER TO KNOW

20:46.512 --> 20:48.414
WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE WITH THE

20:48.414 --> 20:48.948
BODIES.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.216
>> Sreenivasan: AND HAS THE

20:50.216 --> 20:51.417
WEATHER THERE IMPROVED RIGHT NOW

20:51.417 --> 20:53.219
OR WHAT IS IT LIKE IF PEOPLE ARE

20:53.219 --> 20:54.954
SLEEPING OUTDOORS IN TENTS?

20:54.954 --> 20:55.855
>> IT IS MUCH BETTER.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.289
THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER

20:57.289 --> 20:58.324
THE QUAKE THERE WAS A LOT OF

20:58.324 --> 21:00.593
RAIN AND MUD AND IT WAS VERY

21:00.593 --> 21:02.261
UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT EVERYWHERE WE

21:02.261 --> 21:04.797
WENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS,

21:04.797 --> 21:05.698
THE.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.799
BOTH RURAL AREAS AND IN THE

21:06.799 --> 21:07.633
CAPITAL IT WAS MUCH NICER.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.401
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT IS THE

21:09.401 --> 21:11.303
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE BEEN LIKE?

21:11.303 --> 21:13.372
>> IT HAS BEEN VERY MIXED.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.341
I HAVE SEEN POLICE AND ARMY

21:15.341 --> 21:16.642
EVERYWHERE WE HAVE BEEN.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.810
THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY

21:17.810 --> 21:19.778
PROFESSIONAL AND HELPFUL.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.547
REALLY HAVE, HELPED NOT ONLY

21:21.547 --> 21:23.249
SECURE BUT RESCUING PEOPLE,

21:23.249 --> 21:24.517
FINDING PEOPLE AND RESCUING

21:24.517 --> 21:25.818
THEM, ONE CASE WHERE THEY

21:25.818 --> 21:27.253
ACTUALLY BROUGHT A SOLAR PANEL

21:27.253 --> 21:29.588
TO A CAMP SO PEOPLE COULD CHARGE

21:29.588 --> 21:31.891
THEIR CELLPHONES, VERY

21:31.891 --> 21:32.892
PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE,

21:32.892 --> 21:33.759
ESPECIALLY BY THE POLICE.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.494
THE CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IS

21:35.494 --> 21:37.263
REALLY, HAS REALLY NOT DONE VERY

21:37.263 --> 21:37.663
WELL.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.265
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHAOS, A

21:39.265 --> 21:41.066
LOT OF EXTRA RULES WERE PUT IN

21:41.066 --> 21:43.002
PLACE FOR CUSTOMS TO BRING IN

21:43.002 --> 21:45.271
AID, A LOT OF AID WAS REALLY

21:45.271 --> 21:46.605
BLOCKED AT THE MAIN AIRPORT FOR

21:46.605 --> 21:47.673
A LONG TIME, THERE WAS

21:47.673 --> 21:48.908
INFIGHTING GOING ON BETWEEN

21:48.908 --> 21:50.276
POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THIS

21:50.276 --> 21:50.743
WHOLE DISASTER.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.378
IT IS A LITTLE BETTER NOW BUT I

21:52.378 --> 21:54.980
THINK MANY PEOPLE, NEPALIS HAVE

21:54.980 --> 21:56.015
EXPRESSED A LOT OF

21:56.015 --> 21:56.715
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE

21:56.715 --> 21:57.883
POLITICIANS AND THE CIVILIAN

21:57.883 --> 21:58.751
LEADERSHIP DURING THIS CRISIS.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.753
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:00.753 --> 22:02.021
PAMELA OF THE WASHINGTON POST,

22:02.021 --> 22:02.555
THANKS SO MUCH.

22:02.555 --> 22:07.393
>> YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.427
>>

22:08.427 --> 22:09.161
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE
