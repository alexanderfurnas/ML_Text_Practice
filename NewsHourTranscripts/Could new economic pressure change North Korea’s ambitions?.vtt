JUDY WOODRUFF: There
are no easy answers,
and few good options,
when it comes to dealing

00:04.233 --> 00:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now with North Korea.

00:06.133 --> 00:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at whether new economic
sanctions like those being
considered at the United

00:10.533 --> 00:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nations could change
the trajectory of
the country's nuclear
ambitions with David Cohen,

00:17.600 --> 00:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who served as undersecretary
for terrorism and financial
intelligence at the Treasury

00:22.500 --> 00:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Department during the
Obama administration.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also served as the
deputy director of the
Central Intelligence
Agency from 2015 to 2017.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Mearsheimer, a
West Point graduate and
former Air Force officer,
he writes extensively

00:38.166 --> 00:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on strategic issues and is a
political science professor
at the University of Chicago.

00:42.966 --> 00:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also works with the U.S.
intelligence community.

00:44.433 --> 00:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you to the "NewsHour."

00:47.000 --> 00:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to start with
you, David Cohen.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard in Nick Schifrin's
report Ambassador Nikki
Haley referring to
countries doing business

00:54.966 --> 00:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with North Korea in
violation of U.N. sanctions.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the picture?

01:00.200 --> 01:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Give us a picture of the
financial and business
dealings other countries
do right now with

01:03.133 --> 01:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the North.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary for Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence: Well,

01:07.133 --> 01:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of it is illicit, with
the exception of the trade
with China, and that tends to

01:11.700 --> 01:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be in coal, in minerals
and very few other items.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are other countries
around the world, in Africa in
particular, in the Gulf, where

01:22.433 --> 01:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have North Korean laborers
working and where you have
North Korea selling weapons

01:29.766 --> 01:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these countries.

01:31.833 --> 01:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is in violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions and
in violations of the sanctions.

01:37.933 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And those transactions
tend to flow through
financial institutions
in China in a way that

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is intended to be disguised
from the international
community, because they
are illicit transactions.

01:51.966 --> 01:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you have
written that new sanctions could
be written, could be enacted

01:55.533 --> 01:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that would put
real pressure on the North.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What would those look like?

02:00.600 --> 02:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, what they
would look like are sanctions
principally focused on Chinese

02:06.433 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front companies and Chinese
institutions that are
facilitating this illicit trade.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look at the way
that North Korea engages
with the world today,
there are a few nodes,

02:19.566 --> 02:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20, 40, 100 nodes, but it's a
limited sets of these companies
and these financial institutions

02:27.133 --> 02:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in China where the bulk of
the financial activity occurs.

02:31.666 --> 02:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We could focus on those nodes,
squeeze those nodes, and as a
result of that, squeeze North

02:38.433 --> 02:40.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John
Mearsheimer, you have
taken a look at this.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that could work?

02:43.366 --> 02:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER, University
of Chicago: No, I don't think
sanctions will work, Judy, and

02:46.300 --> 02:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there are
two reasons for that.

02:48.366 --> 02:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One is that North Korea
is not going to give
up its nuclear weapons.

02:52.066 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indeed, it would be crazy to
give up its nuclear weapons.

02:56.066 --> 03:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States is interested
in regime change, and nuclear
weapons are the ultimate

03:00.366 --> 03:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deterrent.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you would have to inflict
enormous pain on North Korea
to get it to give up those

03:08.800 --> 03:10.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear weapons.

03:10.833 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you would really
have to put tremendous
economic pressure on them.

03:16.766 --> 03:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you cannot do that, in
large part because the Chinese
will not allow you to do it.

03:21.466 --> 03:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For China, North Korea is
a vital strategic asset.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For China, it's imperative
that the North Korean regime
remain in place and that the

03:28.700 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regime not be toppled.

03:30.700 --> 03:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore, if we try to put
really significant pressure,
economic pressure, on Pyongyang,

03:37.500 --> 03:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Chinese will just move in
and counter it and make sure
that the North Korean regime

03:43.100 --> 03:43.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
survives.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

03:45.933 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: And, again,
that regime is determined
to keep its nuclear weapons.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David
Cohen, what about that?

03:49.133 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, John's right
that the North Korean regime
looks at the nuclear weapons

03:54.866 --> 03:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs as the guarantor
of regime survival.

03:58.733 --> 04:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is the possibility
that there is a wedge that can
be driven between the nuclear

04:05.366 --> 04:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
weapons program and
Kim Jong-un's desire
to stay in power.

04:08.866 --> 04:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the way to drive that
wedge is by putting coercive,
diplomatic and economic pressure

04:17.266 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the regime in North Korea.

04:19.933 --> 04:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will need China to
make this effective.

04:23.833 --> 04:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We cannot do it over
China's objections.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But his
point is China won't do it.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Well, I
think we have not fully
tested that proposition.

04:30.966 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the purposes served
by the sanctions that were done
last week and the sanctions

04:37.933 --> 04:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can do is to encourage
China to take this more
seriously and to work with us.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John
Mearsheimer, why can't that
be -- why can't that happen?

04:45.700 --> 04:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, let
me respond to David's point.

04:48.366 --> 04:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

04:50.333 --> 04:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: What President
Trump wanted to do was, he
wanted to get the Chinese to

04:54.133 --> 04:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put significant pressure on
North Korea to stop these
nuclear tests and to reach some

05:01.033 --> 05:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of modus vivendi
with the United States.

05:04.866 --> 05:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the Chinese
could not do that.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason the Chinese
could not do that and the reason
they won't be able to implement

05:12.433 --> 05:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David's suggested policy
is because the Chinese
have remarkably little
leverage over North

05:19.666 --> 05:20.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

05:20.933 --> 05:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the North Koreans
fully understand that.

05:22.933 --> 05:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the North Koreans don't
play along with the Chinese
when they put pressure on them,

05:27.666 --> 05:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the North Koreans fully
understand that the Chinese
need North Korea to survive.

05:34.666 --> 05:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the North Koreans
understand that, it gives them
significant room to basically

05:39.400 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poke the Chinese in the eye.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David Cohen,
what about his point that North
Korea -- that China really

05:43.900 --> 05:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does have limited leverage,
not as much as I think some
people have been thinking?

05:47.700 --> 05:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: They actually have
quite a lot of leverage, in
both the illicit and the illicit

05:54.633 --> 05:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - sorry -- the licit and
the illicit financial activity
that goes in North Korea.

05:57.533 --> 06:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can squeeze North
Korea on the coal sales.

06:00.966 --> 06:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They can squeeze North
Korea on their illicit
financial activity.

06:04.733 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will do it to an
extent that doesn't
cause a destabilizing
situation in North Korea,

06:11.700 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they can do it in a way
that can make North Korea
more interested in a potential

06:16.000 --> 06:17.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negotiation.

06:17.966 --> 06:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're
talking about threading a
needle here, John Mearsheimer.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like we're talking
about something in between doing
nothing and doing a lot more.

06:26.633 --> 06:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, you
can do a little bit more, but
the point is to make the North

06:30.533 --> 06:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Koreans give up their nuclear
weapons, you have to put a
great deal of pain, a great

06:36.800 --> 06:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal of punishment on them.

06:38.933 --> 06:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Chinese are not going
to play that game, because the
Chinese are heavily dependent

06:44.933 --> 06:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on maintaining a
sovereign North Korea.

06:47.466 --> 06:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the last thing they want
to do is see the West bring
North Korea to its knees, and

06:52.133 --> 06:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then see North Korea crumble,
and run the risk of South
Korea incorporating North Korea

06:58.433 --> 06:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into a greater Korea.

06:59.966 --> 07:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This would be a strategic
disaster for the Chinese.

07:02.433 --> 07:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is why we have so
little leverage over North
Korea when we try to go through

07:08.033 --> 07:08.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Chinese.

07:08.966 --> 07:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that?

07:11.033 --> 07:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, I think
that John and I agree that it
would require an extraordinary

07:16.066 --> 07:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amount of pressure to bring
the North Koreans to the table.

07:18.433 --> 07:20.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
My point is that
we ought to try.

07:20.566 --> 07:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The alternative is to sort of
accept a North Korea with a
nuclear weapon, with an ICBM.

07:27.633 --> 07:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is the potential
that we can use pressure
working with the Chinese
to thread that needle

07:34.800 --> 07:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring the North Koreans
to the table and to find
a way to denuclearize
the Korean Peninsula,

07:40.866 --> 07:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Chinese have been very
clear about for many years is
also their policy preference,

07:45.666 --> 07:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a denuclearized
Korean Peninsula.

07:47.766 --> 07:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to bring --
perhaps this would bring them
to the table to talk in that

07:51.066 --> 07:52.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

07:52.066 --> 07:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Correct.

07:53.533 --> 07:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
we're not going to resolve...

07:54.200 --> 07:55.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

07:55.066 --> 07:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

07:56.566 --> 07:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think what we agree -- John
Mearsheimer, quick comment?

07:57.766 --> 07:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Yes,
just very quickly.

07:59.766 --> 08:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's assume that David's
right, and we can put tremendous
pressure on the North Koreans.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we really want to do that?

08:07.266 --> 08:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we want to back a
nuclear-armed state run by
Kim Jong-un into a corner?

08:13.333 --> 08:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't that the most likely
scenario where they might use
nuclear weapons, when they're

08:16.200 --> 08:18.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
