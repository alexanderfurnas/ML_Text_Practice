GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL, Commander,
U.S. Central
Command: The air crew mistakenly
believed

00:09.943 --> 00:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the trauma center was the
Taliban-controlled
building, which was about a
quarter-mile away.

00:13.847 --> 00:19.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Pentagon has
disciplined
16 U.S. military personnel after
investigating

00:19.987 --> 00:26.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bombing last fall of a
hospital in Afghanistan
that left over 40 dead.

00:26.460 --> 00:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: revisiting the man who is
literally
walking around the world. Paul
Salopek talks

00:32.799 --> 00:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about entering a new phase in
his journey.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic:
It's going to be more like an
expedition this

00:38.505 --> 00:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. Rather than walking from
farm to farm,
I'm going to actually have to
camp out and

00:43.310 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look for water and go into
survival mode on
this stretch.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: With the
presidential
race all coming down to a
numbers game, we

00:51.351 --> 00:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a look at how one state is
handling the
delegate selection process.

00:55.789 --> 01:00.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mark Shields and David
Brooks are here
to analyze the week's news.

01:00.794 --> 01:05.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:07.067 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A U.S. attack on
a charity
hospital in Afghanistan that
left 42 people

01:20.781 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead was not a war crime. That
is the conclusion
of a Pentagon investigation
which determined

01:26.753 --> 01:33.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the October strike was
unintentional, the
result of human error and
equipment failures.

01:33.160 --> 01:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixteen U.S. service members
have been disciplined
as a result, but none will face
criminal charges.

01:38.665 --> 01:43.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will delve deeper into the
findings right
after this news summary.

01:43.270 --> 01:48.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A protest and an endorsement
stole much of
the show in Republican
presidential politics

01:49.076 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:51.845 --> 01:58.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A melee today, as
protesters and
police clashed outside the hotel
hosting the

01:59.086 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California Republican Party
Convention. The
scheduled speaker? Front-runner
Donald Trump.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because of the commotion, the
candidate had
to take the long way in.

02:08.895 --> 02:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
That wasn't the easiest entrance
I have ever

02:12.532 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:14.901 --> 02:17.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: My wife called.
She said, "There
are helicopters following you."
And we did.

02:18.071 --> 02:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we went under a fence
and through
a fence. And, oh, boy, it felt
like I was

02:23.744 --> 02:24.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crossing the border, actually.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:25.312 --> 02:27.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: It's true.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's his second
straight day in
the state, and the second day
marred by protests;

02:31.618 --> 02:36.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
17 people were arrested outside
his rally
last night in Orange County.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Live from the heartland!

02:37.991 --> 02:42.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: From a hotly
contested Indiana,
the state's top Republican,
Governor Mike

02:42.529 --> 02:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence, told Republican listeners
who won his
coveted endorsement.

02:45.932 --> 02:50.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), Indiana:
I'm not against
anybody, but I will be voting
for Ted Cruz

02:50.137 --> 02:55.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the upcoming Republican
primary. I see
Ted Cruz as a principled
conservative who's

02:55.375 --> 03:01.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
dedicated his career to
advocating the Reagan
agenda. And I'm pleased to
support him.

03:01.415 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Texas senator is
banking on
a good showing in the Hoosier
State next week.

03:06.853 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We have a choice. Do we want to
get behind

03:11.425 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a campaign that is based on
yelling and screaming
and cursing and insults, or do
we want to

03:15.796 --> 03:22.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unite behind a positive,
optimistic, forward-looking,
conservative campaign based on
real solutions

03:22.769 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the problems in this country?

03:25.405 --> 03:27.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:27.307 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Democrat Bernie
Sanders is also
hoping for a good result in
Indiana. Today,

03:31.878 --> 03:34.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had tough words for a major
employer in
Indianapolis, its now-shuttered
factory providing

03:34.748 --> 03:36.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the backdrop.

03:36.783 --> 03:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Today, we are sending a very
loud and clear

03:44.357 --> 03:54.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message to the CEO of United
Technologies:
Stop the greed. Stop destroying
the middle

03:55.068 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class in America. Respect your
workers. Respect
the American people.

03:59.139 --> 04:04.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sanders, though, is
still the underdog
for the nomination, trailing
Hillary Clinton

04:04.778 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by about 300 pledged delegates,
by 800 if
you count superdelegates.

04:11.585 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton ended her two-day break
from the public
eye in New York City, talking
race and education.

04:16.289 --> 04:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Given the right circumstances,
given the appropriate

04:20.927 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adult involvement and attention,
every child
can succeed. And we have got to
believe that,

04:28.401 --> 04:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we have got to invest in
that.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:33.039 --> 04:37.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In 2008, Clinton beat
then-Senator
Obama in the Indiana primary.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at the presidential race,
including the key

04:43.917 --> 04:49.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role the individual delegates
will play in
selecting a nominee, later in
the program.

04:49.222 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, fresh violence rocked
the war-torn
city of Aleppo today. Insurgents
shelled a

04:55.128 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosque in a government-held
neighborhood,
killing at least 15 people.
Meanwhile, new

05:00.600 --> 05:05.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air raids hit rebel-controlled
areas of Aleppo,
while the death toll from
Wednesday's strike

05:06.006 --> 05:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a hospital rose to 50, all
that as the
U.S. and Russia tried to
reinforce a cease-fire

05:12.812 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a Damascus suburb, and in the
port city
of Latakia.

05:16.283 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: We
want to focus on strengthening
the cessation

05:22.656 --> 05:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hostilities, renewing it,
reaffirming it,
so that we can quell the
fighting or the violations,

05:29.596 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ongoing violations in these
areas. We're
fully aware of that. Aleppo is a
trouble spot.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we're starting here.

05:37.504 --> 05:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Violence in and
around Aleppo
has claimed the lives of more
than 200 people

05:42.209 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in just the last eight days.

05:44.644 --> 05:49.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea's Supreme Court has
sentenced
a Korean-American businessman to
10 years

05:49.416 --> 05:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hard labor, after finding him
guilty of
spying and stealing state
secrets. Kim Dong

05:55.188 --> 06:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chul appeared today in court in
Pyongyang.
He was handcuffed and could be
seen wiping

06:00.660 --> 06:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away tears. Kim is the second
American imprisoned
by North Korea this year.

06:06.099 --> 06:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. reported its first Zika
virus-related
death today. The Centers for
Disease Control

06:12.772 --> 06:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Prevention said that a
70-year-old man
in Puerto Rico died from
complications from

06:18.078 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mosquito-borne virus. The
U.S. territory
has at least 683 confirmed Zika
cases; 65

06:26.519 --> 06:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those are pregnant women.

06:29.155 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Biden visited the
Vatican today,
and called for a global
commitment to the

06:33.660 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fight against cancer. His
appearance was part
of the Vatican's conference on
regenerative

06:38.932 --> 06:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medicine. The vice president met
Pope Francis,
and in a speech urged
philanthropists, corporations,

06:45.572 --> 06:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and governments to increase
cancer research
funding.

06:48.975 --> 06:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: As we stand on the cusp
of unprecedented

06:53.613 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientific and technological
change, of amazing
discoveries that were once
unimaginable breakthroughs,

07:03.623 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we cannot forget that real lives
and real
people are at the heart and
reason for all

07:12.899 --> 07:14.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we do.

07:14.734 --> 07:18.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice
president's elder
son died of brain cancer last
year. Months

07:19.039 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later, Mr. Biden declared a --
quote -- "moon
shot" to cure cancer, when he
announced he

07:24.010 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wouldn't run for president.

07:25.912 --> 07:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Eurozone has bounced back to
pre-recession
levels after an eight-year
financial crisis.

07:32.085 --> 07:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its economy unexpectedly doubled
in the first
three months of this year.

07:36.356 --> 07:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, on Wall Street,
stocks fell after
the U.S. economy recorded its
slowest pace

07:41.728 --> 07:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of growth in two years. The Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 57 points to close
at 17773.

07:48.935 --> 07:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 30, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped 10. For the week, both
the Dow and

07:55.842 --> 08:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the S&amp;P 500 lost more than a
percent. The
Nasdaq fell nearly 3 percent.

08:02.082 --> 08:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a treasure trove of ancient
Roman coins
has been unearthed in Southern
Spain. Construction

08:08.121 --> 08:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers made the discovery while
laying pipes
in a small town outside Seville.
The 1,300

08:13.827 --> 08:20.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pounds of bronze- and
silver-coated coins
had been stored in clay jugs.
Archaeologists

08:20.467 --> 08:24.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they date back to the late
4th century,
when Romans ruled the region.

08:25.038 --> 08:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANA NAVARRO ORTEGA, Museum
Director (through
translator): We had already seen
coins like

08:29.142 --> 08:34.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, but what is incredible is
a discovery
of this dimension. There are 19
jugs full.

08:34.481 --> 08:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can assure you that the jugs
cannot be lifted
by one person because of all the
weight and

08:38.752 --> 08:43.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the quantity of the coins
inside. So now what
we have to do is begin to
understand the historical

08:43.757 --> 08:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and archaeological context of
this discovery.

08:46.726 --> 08:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Researchers
believe the coins
had been stored away to pay for
soldiers or

08:51.197 --> 08:53.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civil servants.

08:53.233 --> 08:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a deeper
look into the U.S. bombing of an
Afghan hospital;

08:58.438 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selecting the delegates who will
hold the
keys to the presidential
nomination; Mark

09:03.309 --> 09:17.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and David Brooks delve
into this week's
news; and much more.

09:17.891 --> 09:23.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an American bombing of an
Afghan hospital
that killed dozens last year.
Today, the Pentagon

09:23.730 --> 09:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released a 3,000-page-long
inquiry into the
attack and the major mistakes
that led to

09:29.769 --> 09:30.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

09:33.606 --> 09:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Pentagon
laid out the
key findings of its full
investigation today,

09:37.510 --> 09:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as the fallout affecting
16 service
members.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Head of U.S. Central Command,
General Joseph
Votel:

09:43.316 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL, Commander,
U.S. Central
Command: The investigation
concluded that

09:45.718 --> 09:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain personnel failed to
comply with the
rules of engagement in the law
of armed conflict.

09:50.990 --> 09:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The bombing of
the Doctors
Without Borders hospital last
October in Kunduz,

09:55.261 --> 10:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan killed 42 people. Of
the 16 service
members who were punished, one
was a two-star

10:01.267 --> 10:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general and some were specials
ops forces.
They face administrative
actions, but Votel

10:06.739 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maintained their actions didn't
constitute
a war crime.

10:08.775 --> 10:13.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL: The label war
crimes is
typically reserved for
intentional acts, intentionally

10:13.780 --> 10:18.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
targeting civilians or
intentionally targeting
protected objects or locations.

10:18.718 --> 10:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investigation found that the
incident
resulted from a combination of
unintentional

10:22.989 --> 10:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human errors, process errors and
equipment
failures, and that none of the
personnel knew

10:28.428 --> 10:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were striking a hospital.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even though
they didn't
know they were hitting a
hospital, the investigation

10:33.700 --> 10:37.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
found they made multiple
fundamental and fatal
errors.

10:37.337 --> 10:43.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, the AC-130
gunship's targeting
system became misaligned after
its crew attempted

10:43.209 --> 10:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to avoid fire over Kunduz. That
resulted in
their target appearing as an
empty field,

10:49.315 --> 10:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of a building filled
with Taliban
fighters firing on Afghan
troops. The crew

10:54.087 --> 10:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then switched its focus to the
hospital, thinking
it was the original target,
based on descriptions

10:59.592 --> 11:01.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relayed from special forces on
the ground.

11:01.628 --> 11:06.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL: So the
aircraft is looking
at one location. The ground
force is thinking

11:06.132 --> 11:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're looking at another
location. There's
no way to visually confirm that
back and forth

11:11.070 --> 11:16.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between them, and their
discussions, as you
look at the transcripts, don't
add clarity

11:16.976 --> 11:18.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Officials from
Doctors Without
Borders called it an
insufficient explanation.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the group's
president wrote:
"Today's briefing amounts to an
admission

11:26.052 --> 11:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an uncontrolled military
operation in a
densely populated urban area,
during which

11:31.925 --> 11:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. forces failed to follow the
basic laws
of war."

11:35.295 --> 11:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization pressed for an
independent
investigation. They pulled out
of Kunduz entirely

11:40.333 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the attack in October.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the military's
investigation and
the mistakes that were made, we
turn to veteran

11:46.706 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon correspondent Jamie
McIntyre. He's
now with The Washington Examiner
and an occasional

11:51.110 --> 11:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special correspondent for the
"NewsHour."

11:53.479 --> 11:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jamie, when we first started
reported the
story when it happened in
October, the narrative

11:57.216 --> 12:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that U.S. forces or Afghan
forces were
under attack and that this air
cover was there

12:04.090 --> 12:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in almost a defensive capacity.
But the report
paints a different picture.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE, Washington
Examiner: That's
right.

12:09.796 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a really important
point, Hari, because
unlike in Iraq, where U.S.
airstrikes are

12:14.934 --> 12:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
routinely helping forces on the
ground conduct
offensive operations, in
Afghanistan, that's

12:20.006 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not supposed to be the case.

12:22.041 --> 12:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Combat officially ended in
Afghanistan at
the end of 2014, so U.S.
airstrikes are limited

12:27.013 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to just three very specific
instances, protecting
U.S. troops on the ground, going
after remnants

12:32.585 --> 12:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of al-Qaida, and protecting
Afghan forces,
if they're in danger of being
overrun and

12:37.724 --> 12:39.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slaughtered.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the commander on the ground
said he did
this because his forces were
under fire. But

12:43.930 --> 12:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the report shows is that
they were nowhere
near this building. They weren't
taking fire.

12:48.935 --> 12:53.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, he called in the
airstrike in order
to help the Afghan forces who
were going to

12:53.940 --> 12:58.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
launch a raid on this government
building
where the Taliban was held up.

12:58.311 --> 13:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this tragic accident, which
has a whole
series of factors involved,
never would have

13:04.384 --> 13:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened if the commander on the
ground had
not exceeded his authority in
calling in that

13:10.223 --> 13:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrike which was essentially
to soften
up the target so Afghani forces
could mount

13:15.294 --> 13:18.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an offensive. That's not
something U.S. troops
supposedly doing.

13:18.898 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
let's talk
about the series of errors that
led to this

13:23.569 --> 13:25.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tragedy.

13:25.571 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Doctors Without Borders
has said, listen,
we tell everyone in the battle
theater exactly

13:30.376 --> 13:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where our locations are. The
military has
this list. But it looks like
this flight took

13:35.848 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off without that list to begin
with.

13:37.717 --> 13:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Yes, there is no
question
this was a protected site that
was not supposed

13:41.521 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be hit. It was on a no-strike
list.

13:43.356 --> 13:48.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as in any accident or
mishap like this,
there is a whole series of
things that go

13:48.294 --> 13:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong. You interrupt that chain
at any point,
the bad thing doesn't happen.
And this one

13:52.432 --> 13:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started when the AC-130 gunship
took off in
what it thought was an emergency
mission to

13:57.904 --> 14:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go help some U.S. troops on the
ground. Turned
out they didn't have to. They
were on their

14:02.275 --> 14:04.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way back.

14:04.143 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of that, they took off
early, didn't
have the no-strike list loaded
into their

14:08.748 --> 14:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plane. They also were then
threatened by a
shoulder-fired missile from the
ground. That

14:14.554 --> 14:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caused them to divert their
course. Their
radio antenna and satellite
radio didn't work,

14:20.126 --> 14:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so they couldn't get updatedñ
information.

14:22.929 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said in your report, when
they came
back, they were at a different
angle. The

14:27.166 --> 14:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targeting system pointed them to
an empty
field. And then they made the
really fatal

14:31.771 --> 14:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mistake. And that was to try to
identify the
target visually on the ground
based on the

14:36.075 --> 14:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
description that they had.

14:37.977 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they simply confused the
hospital building
for this government compound
that was about

14:43.182 --> 14:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a quarter-mile away. And once
they thought
that was the target, they were
convinced.

14:48.054 --> 14:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were locked onto it. And
they began really
withering fire from the air that
lasted almost

14:54.494 --> 14:56.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a half-an-hour.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is
basedñ off a
description they're getting from
someone who's

14:58.631 --> 15:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground not next to the
hospital or
next to where the fighting
allegedly was happening,

15:02.935 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but several kilometers away.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Yes, they were
nine kilometers
away.

15:06.072 --> 15:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's another -- normally,
you have to
have eyes on the target. There
is somebody

15:11.010 --> 15:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground called a JTAC,
joint tactical
air controller, essentially a
spotter who

15:15.448 --> 15:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is spotting the target. They're
supposed to
have eyes on the target. What
the report found

15:19.452 --> 15:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was, nobody had eyes on the
target, not the
Afghans, not the Americans.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, course, the crew
of the plane
didn't either. And this, by the
way, is a

15:27.160 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very fearsome weapon, this
AC-130 gunship.
It's a modified AC-130 -- C-130
aircraft with

15:34.534 --> 15:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a series of cannons out the left
side. It
circles the target and just
rains shells down

15:40.673 --> 15:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the target. It can really do
damage to
a target. And that's what
happened here.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jamie, even in
this report,
there still seems to be a
discrepancy in how

15:50.149 --> 15:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long this attack took place. The
government
has one number and how many
minutes the AC-130

15:56.022 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was circling this hospital. But
the Doctors
Without Borders folks in the
beginning had

16:00.193 --> 16:01.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a different number.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Yes, so they say
it was about
an hour-and-a-half.

16:03.529 --> 16:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, they were
making desperate
calls to the U.S.ñ military
headquarters,

16:08.267 --> 16:12.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
saying, look, we're being
attacked. Call off
that plane.

16:12.338 --> 16:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon today admittedñ
that those calls,
as you might expect, went
through some layers

16:16.676 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bureaucracy before they --
the message
was passed to ground commanders.
According

16:21.447 --> 16:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Pentagon's investigation,
once they
determined that was happening,
the information

16:25.785 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was relayed to the plane crew,
and they stopped
shooting.

16:28.654 --> 16:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, as you mentioned,
there's a discrepancy
about that. And Doctors Without
Borders has

16:33.226 --> 16:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put out their own investigation,
their own
account of what happened based
on the eyewitness

16:38.264 --> 16:42.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports of the people on the
ground. And,
really, it's really just a
horrific description

16:42.401 --> 16:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this very, very terrible
tragedy that happened
in the very early morning hours
of the day.

16:47.106 --> 16:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, let's
talk about
what's happening to these
individuals. There

16:50.843 --> 16:55.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were no criminal charges here.
Why? And what
happens to these people?

16:55.681 --> 16:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Well, they
decided not to
court-martial anyone because
theyñ decided

16:59.552 --> 17:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this was an unintentional
act, that at
every step of the way, people
were trying

17:03.723 --> 17:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do the right thing. They just
made some
very, very terrible mistakes.

17:07.994 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, ñthe people involved in
this got reprimands.
Some of them got ordered to do
training. That

17:13.833 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the military is a serious
thing. They refer
to that as a career-ending
letter of reprimand,

17:18.437 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because once you get one of
these in your
file, you're not going to be
promoted. In

17:21.574 --> 17:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the military, if you're not
promoted, you
have to leave.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, many of these people will
end up leaving
the military. And the Pentagon
has made some

17:28.014 --> 17:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes since then. One thing
they're doing
now is, they're not sending out
any planes

17:31.317 --> 17:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out without pre-loading the
information that
has the no-strike list. You
might think they

17:36.289 --> 17:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been doing that all along,
but they weren't.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: And so they're
trying to make
sure that this kind of thing
doesn't happen

17:41.827 --> 17:43.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

17:43.796 --> 17:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Washington
Examiner Pentagon
correspondent Jamie McIntyre,
thanks so much.

17:56.709 --> 18:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After Donald
Trump swept the
primaries in five Northeastern
states this

18:06.986 --> 18:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week, the front-runner edged
even closer to
that magic number of delegates
we have all

18:11.223 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard so much about; 1,237 are
needed to secure
the GOP nomination.

18:17.163 --> 18:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His opponents are redoubling
their efforts
to keep Trump from reaching that
number, which

18:22.301 --> 18:26.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would make this the first
contested convention
in four decades.

18:26.172 --> 18:31.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If that happens, it's the
delegates, the actual
people in those seats at the
Cleveland hall,

18:32.044 --> 18:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who will play a make-or-break
role in selecting
the nominee.

18:36.048 --> 18:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang takes a look at how
all this is
playing out behind the scenes in
a key state,

18:41.153 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Virginia.

18:42.955 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: It's a Friday
afternoon in the
woods of Southern Virginia.
There's a heaping

18:48.728 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping of smoked shad, country
music, and
politics.

18:56.769 --> 19:06.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the 68th Annual Shad
Planking Festival,
a Virginia tradition that's part
cookout,

19:06.612 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part political gathering. This
year, it's
a key stop for Republicans who
want to be

19:11.250 --> 19:13.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
delegates to the national
convention in Cleveland.

19:13.452 --> 19:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I have been very vocal
about my support
for Ted Cruz. I believe that he
is the clear

19:18.224 --> 19:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
constitutional conservative.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAY CHASE, Virginia Delegate
Candidate: Party
unity is critical right now. We
need to coalesce

19:22.261 --> 19:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind Mr. Trump and win in
November.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The Virginia one was just a
great win.

19:26.465 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump won the
Virginia primary
on March 1, but that was just
the first step

19:31.871 --> 19:37.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in selecting the state's
convention delegates
to the national convention.
Winning the primary

19:37.676 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave Trump 17 delegate votes,
one more than
Marco Rubio. Ted Cruz came away
with eight

19:44.283 --> 19:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delegate votes. John Kasich got
five.

19:47.853 --> 19:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under state party rules, that's
how the Virginia
delegation will vote on the
first ballot at

19:53.159 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Cleveland convention. But --
and this
is key -- if nobody gets that
1,237 on the

19:59.265 --> 20:04.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first ballot, Virginia's
delegates, like most
of the delegates from the other
states, will

20:04.403 --> 20:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
become free agents, able to vote
for whomever
they want.

20:09.742 --> 20:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From gatherings like the Shad
Planking to
the state party convention this
weekend, the

20:15.147 --> 20:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigns are trying to pack
Virginia's delegation
with their supporters.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN FARNSWORTH, University
of Mary Washington:
What you are seeing in Virginia
looks a lot

20:20.286 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like what you are seeing in a
number of other
states, where the Donald Trump
campaign may

20:25.024 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have won the primary, but when
it comes time
to go through the integral
process of delegate

20:29.995 --> 20:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
selection, it looks like Ted
Cruz is doing
a lot better.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Stephen Farnsworth is
a political
scientist at the University of
Mary Washington.

20:37.536 --> 20:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says voting for Trump on a
second ballot
or a third, or even a fourth
would be a tough

20:43.109 --> 20:44.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sell for many Virginia
delegates.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN FARNSWORTH: A lot of the
truly committed
Republicans believe that Donald
Trump is not

20:48.581 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best standard-bearer for the
Republican
Party. He is going to have to
try to convince

20:51.984 --> 20:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them this late in the game that
he is, and
that's going to be an uphill
battle, because

20:56.489 --> 21:01.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of these people are
already committed
in their own minds, in their own
hearts to

21:01.460 --> 21:03.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other candidates.

21:03.462 --> 21:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Shak Hill is one of
those Virginia
committed Republicans. He's a
Cruz organizer

21:08.534 --> 21:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's been recruiting supporters
to run to
be delegates at the Cleveland
Convention.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAK HILL, Cruz Organizer: What
we have been
doing behind the scenes is
finding like-minded

21:15.908 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
teachers and like-minded
policemen and business
owners to come to the convention
and actually

21:21.714 --> 21:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
participate in the process. And
the beauty
about this is, we actually
started in November

21:27.586 --> 21:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to identify folks that
would end up
coming to the convention, and
this is going

21:31.423 --> 21:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to give Senator Cruz a huge
advantage.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He sees the contest
as a heavyweight
title fight.

21:36.929 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAK HILL: The first round of
that boxing
match is getting the delegates,
1,237. So

21:43.869 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if none of the Republican
candidates actually
get to that threshold, we are
going to have

21:48.774 --> 21:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a second ballot. And the second
ballot is
going to hopefully go towards
Senator Ted

21:54.380 --> 21:56.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cruz.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART, Virginia Trump
Campaign Chairman:
We're confident at this point
that it's going

21:57.983 --> 21:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a first ballot victory.
We're confident
we're going to hit 1,237.

22:00.085 --> 22:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Corey Stewart is
Trump's Virginia
chairman.

22:03.556 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cruz organization is trying
to get as
many people in hopes that there
will be a

22:08.294 --> 22:08.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
second ballot.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COREY STEWART: Yes.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Are they preparing
for a war, are
they arming for a battle that
may not happen,

22:14.400 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you think?

22:16.268 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: I think Cruz is
counting on
a lot of people to support him
on a second

22:18.170 --> 22:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot who are not going to go
down in flames
with him. They're going to want
to support

22:22.675 --> 22:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the winner, and they're going to
support Trump.

22:24.877 --> 22:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course,
there's another
man in the race, John Kasich.
He's behind

22:29.715 --> 22:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the delegate count, but his
top delegate
adviser, Charlie Black, is
undeterred.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE BLACK, Kasich Campaign
Adviser: We
believe, because a lot of those
people are

22:37.122 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party regulars and elected
officials, they
will go to Kasich, more to
Kasich than Cruz,

22:41.927 --> 22:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the big issue to those
delegates when
they sit down at the convention
in Cleveland

22:46.632 --> 22:51.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is: Who can win? Who can beat
Hillary Clinton?
And John Kasich's been
consistently ahead

22:51.804 --> 22:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of her in the polls by 10
points.

22:53.839 --> 22:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Black knows about
contested conventions:
He was a delegate hunter at the
last one in

22:58.877 --> 23:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
1976. One of his aides? A
24-year-old John
Kasich.

23:04.250 --> 23:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE BLACK: In both cases you
have to learn
who the delegates are,
communicate with them,

23:09.989 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk to them, make friends with
them, and
try to convince them, in this
case, for John

23:16.061 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich that he's the reform
conservative who
can win, and ask them to,
whether its the

23:21.433 --> 23:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second, third, fourth, fifth
ballot, to keep
him in mind.

23:24.737 --> 23:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But there is a floor
fight in Cleveland,
political analyst Farnsworth
warns this won't

23:30.342 --> 23:32.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be your grandfather's
convention.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN FARNSWORTH: This is
completely new.

23:33.979 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sometimes think that this is a
process of
sort of like people today trying
to understand

23:39.285 --> 23:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to use a telegraph. It is
really a technological
change. It's really a very
different system,

23:45.891 --> 23:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way that these delegates are
selected
today.

23:47.926 --> 23:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And if Trump fails to
get the nomination
on the first ballot, delegates
selected at

23:52.998 --> 23:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state conventions, like this
weekend's in
Virginia, could well determine
who will become

23:58.404 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican nominee.

24:00.105 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

24:06.045 --> 24:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:14.086 --> 24:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
man walking
across the world prepares to
traverse the

24:19.058 --> 24:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Silk Road; plus, a remix of the
1920's Broadway
musical "Shuffle Along." Mark
Shields, David

24:26.865 --> 24:28.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brooks

24:28.767 --> 24:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, Ted Cruz grabs a key
endorsement
in the Hoosier State, Donald
Trump addresses

24:32.871 --> 24:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy, Hillary Clinton
wins four
of the five primaries this week.

24:37.876 --> 24:41.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is just some of the
political news in
a week that brings us to the
analysis of Shields

24:42.014 --> 24:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark
Shields and New York Times
columnist David

24:46.585 --> 24:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brooks, who is in Pittsburgh
tonight.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

24:51.156 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mark, we just saw John
Yang's report on
what they're doing in Virginia,
these delegates

24:55.728 --> 24:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are hoping it's going to go,
at least
some of them, to a second
ballot. Where does

24:59.765 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this Republican race stand? What
is the likelihood
of it going past the first
ballot?

25:04.002 --> 25:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I think the
likelihood
of it going past the first
ballot is less

25:08.273 --> 25:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than remote at this point.

25:12.311 --> 25:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump had a victory this
week, in the
past two weeks, actually, in
which he not

25:19.151 --> 25:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only carried the five states. He
carried every
congressional district in those
five states,

25:24.556 --> 25:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he carried every county in
those five
states, including New York.
Those states have

25:30.162 --> 25:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amounted to 213 delegate votes
John was reporting
on.

25:35.334 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, the alternative, the
establishment
alternative, collected three
delegates in

25:40.406 --> 25:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those six states. It is --
essentially, Indiana
is Alamo. I think the
Republicans have gone

25:48.113 --> 25:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from resistance to -- from maybe
rebellion
to a sense of resignation. And,
in short order,

25:55.287 --> 25:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will see revisionism. People
will start
to -- Republicans will start to
discover virtues

25:59.525 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Donald Trump that they hadn't
seen before.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Victory will do that.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, where do
you see this
race?

26:04.763 --> 26:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Pretty much the
same way.

26:07.433 --> 26:12.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe there were small
neighborhoods or districts
or townships where Cruz won,
but, yes, it

26:12.905 --> 26:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a convincing win for Donald
Trump. And
if he doesn't hit the majority
number, he's

26:17.242 --> 26:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be close enough, so it
will be super
hard to deny.

26:19.344 --> 26:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things we have
seen in focus
groups among Republican voters,
even those

26:23.148 --> 26:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rank and file who support Cruz
or Kasich,
they don't really like the idea
that if Trump

26:28.253 --> 26:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes so close, that their man
would be superseded
over him. And there is not much
willpower

26:33.192 --> 26:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among the Republicans, either at
the elite
or the mass level, to deny Trump
if he's close,

26:37.696 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which it looks almost certain
like he's going
to be close.

26:40.199 --> 26:44.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second thing that has
happened is not
only Trump is strong, but Cruz
looks a lot

26:44.703 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weaker. And flailing about with
Carly Fiorina
and the alleged Kasich deal,
that looks like

26:51.076 --> 26:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the acts of a drowning man. And
so just in
terms of the moral rigor, the
motivation force,

26:58.684 --> 27:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the morale, Cruz is collapsing,
and Trump
is surging.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I agree with Mark.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Drowning man?

27:06.825 --> 27:07.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:07.593 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, go ahead.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, just one
thing with David's
point, and that is, Bill Cohen,
who was a

27:12.030 --> 27:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States senator, won three
elections,
never lost an election, for city
council,

27:16.702 --> 27:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mayor of Bangor, the House of
Representatives,
had a very simple formula that
he -- he said,

27:21.273 --> 27:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't care how great your
ideas are, how
brilliantly you articulate them.
Before people

27:26.912 --> 27:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote for you, they have to like
you.

27:29.615 --> 27:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what people -- we have
learned is that
people don't like Ted Cruz. And
I think you

27:34.186 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saw an example of it in John
Boehner, the
former speaker of the House.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ouch.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Ouch -- is coming
out in just
-- at Stanford University, and
saying what

27:43.295 --> 27:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a miserable SOB. Never met a
more miserable
sob.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lucifer in the
flesh.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And Lucifer in the
flesh.

27:49.334 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think that there
isn't. And what
you saw was Ted Cruz got 10
percent of the

27:54.540 --> 27:59.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
voted in Rhode Island, 12
percent in Connecticut.
Those are wipeout numbers. And
then he compounded

27:59.344 --> 28:05.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the problem by going into
Indiana, where basketball
is king, and talking about the
ring.

28:05.484 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you can call a basket a
hoop, but nobody
calls it a ring. It's
comparable, Judy, to

28:10.489 --> 28:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone going to Cooperstown,
New York, to
the Baseball Hall of Fame and
saying, I love

28:14.192 --> 28:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Babe Ruth because he hit so many
touchdowns.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:17.863 --> 28:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I just -- I
think it -- you
could almost feel it end at that
point.

28:20.766 --> 28:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, you think
the ring comment
-- let me ask you about the
governor of Indiana,

28:26.972 --> 28:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence. He came out and
today and said
he's voting for Ted Cruz. Now,
he did compliment

28:32.311 --> 28:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump at length before he
said he's
voting for Cruz. What did you
make of that?

28:38.684 --> 28:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, that set new
levels of
lukewarmness.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:43.789 --> 28:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: So he's sort of
for Cruz, maybe,
if you hold a gun to my head.
But, yes, it

28:48.794 --> 28:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't the sort of ringing thing
that's going
to turn the momentum.

28:51.229 --> 28:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, I agree with Mark.
Cruz had a bad
week. The ring thing. The
Lucifer comment

28:58.203 --> 29:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really resonated with a lot of
people. I thought
it was a nicely understated,
generous comment.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:04.977 --> 29:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, yes, it's
funny. When you
go up to Capitol Hill. And I was
up there

29:10.382 --> 29:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two weeks ago. The senators,
they still think
-- one of them told me Cruz has
more fascistic

29:15.454 --> 29:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tendencies than Trump. So, that
level of unpopularity
is undermining Cruz.

29:22.160 --> 29:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wisconsin, where he did so
well, turns
out to be the outlier. That was
the freakish

29:26.565 --> 29:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case where he had all the talk
radio people,
he had everybody on his side.
And that looked

29:31.136 --> 29:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the breakout moment, but it
turns out
to have just been a parenthesis.

29:34.239 --> 29:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if that's the
case, Mark,
does this mean that the
Republican Party is

29:38.543 --> 29:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming around, Republican voters
are coming
around to Donald Trump?

29:42.347 --> 29:44.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

29:44.316 --> 29:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm surprised, as David
wrote about today,
the lack of resistance. There is
a sense almost

29:50.689 --> 29:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- that Donald Trump has
tapped into something,
and I, as a Republican candidate
in 2016,

29:59.097 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharing the ballot with him,
either running
for Congress or the Senate,
don't want to

30:03.035 --> 30:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk alienating. I know what a
problem Donald
Trump can be. He's
controversial. He's a lightning

30:11.677 --> 30:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rod. But he has tapped into
something. And
I don't want to alienate his
voters.

30:16.615 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what it seems. It's
almost like they're
bargaining, even though it's
with alarm in

30:23.488 --> 30:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many cases, certainly with
apprehension in
virtually every case.

30:26.525 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is going on,
in your mind,
David? And if you can talk about
it -- you're

30:32.264 --> 30:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Pittsburgh. You said -- you
told us you're
talking to some Republican
voters there. What

30:36.702 --> 30:38.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are you finding out?

30:38.670 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, a lot of
things I'm finding
out are related to why poverty
is so endemic

30:43.241 --> 30:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even among the white working
class and what
is going on with drug use.

30:46.144 --> 30:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with Trump, I guess what I
find out is
a lot of economic resistance.
And I regard

30:50.082 --> 30:55.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump as a sui generis
candidate, as a candidate
who said a whole series of
appalling things.

30:55.287 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at least the people I spoke
to in the
last day, they don't see him as
sui generis.

30:59.925 --> 31:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like, yes, he said some bad
things, he
said some good things. To them,
he's just

31:03.862 --> 31:05.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a normal candidate.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's true for some of them
who are supporting
Cruz, by the way. And so they
don't see him

31:10.035 --> 31:16.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something as outside the
category of normal
politics. And the politicians,
to fight a

31:16.875 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong force against someone as
compelling
or aggressive as Donald Trump,
you have to

31:22.280 --> 31:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe in your cause. You have
to believe
in what your belief system is.
You have to

31:25.884 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe in your standards.

31:27.686 --> 31:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republican self-confidence
has collapsed.
And so what's striking to me is,
they are

31:33.191 --> 31:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disgusted personally. They feel
he's going
to be disastrous for the party
in the long

31:38.130 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
term, but, for some reason,
they're incapable
thinking in long-term reasoning.

31:42.501 --> 31:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the argument I made in my
column today
was that this is a Joe McCarthy
moment. For

31:46.872 --> 31:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 years after, you are going to
be remembered
for where you stood at this
moment. And Republicans

31:51.610 --> 31:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be saying I'm -- even if
it's out of
self-interest, I will not be on
the side of

31:55.580 --> 31:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that guy. I will register my
disgust with
that guy, so 20 years from now,
my grandchildren

32:00.051 --> 32:02.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be able to say, he was on
the right side.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But so few are doing that.

32:04.356 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, we
know a lot of
Republicans are happy with the
way Donald

32:07.659 --> 32:09.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is going after Hillary
Clinton.

32:09.961 --> 32:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he made a statement this
week I think
that got a lot of notice, where
he said the

32:13.598 --> 32:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only thing she has got is the
woman's card.
And he said if she were a man,
she would be

32:18.003 --> 32:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting just 5 percent of the
vote.

32:20.639 --> 32:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something Donald Trump
needs to be
careful about, or is this an
effective line

32:25.544 --> 32:27.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of argument for him?

32:27.479 --> 32:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I find it hard to
believe it's
an effective line of argument
for him, Judy.

32:31.817 --> 32:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got 69 to 16 unfavorable
rating among
women of both parties, so he's
got a real

32:40.926 --> 32:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem running against Hillary
Clinton. He's
now in the Wall Street --
Washington Post/ABC

32:45.297 --> 32:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
News poll, he's running 70
percent behind
her among white women.

32:49.668 --> 32:54.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why do I say white women?
Because every Republican
-- Ronald Reagan carried white
women twice.

32:54.973 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney carried white women
by 12 percent
over Barack Obama. John McCain
carried white

33:00.212 --> 33:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women over Barack Obama. George
W. Bush carried
white women twice.

33:05.183 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is a real problem. I
have to think
at some level, because Donald
Trump, whatever

33:09.988 --> 33:15.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
else he is, is not an
unintelligent man, and
he's shrewd -- and he's
certainly been shrewd

33:15.260 --> 33:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win this -- that it must be
some subliminal
message he's trying to
communicate, that she's

33:20.532 --> 33:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a woman, she's not strong, she
doesn't have
the stamina.

33:24.569 --> 33:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's kind of talked about it.
That's all I
can think of, because I don't
think that there

33:28.473 --> 33:32.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a constituency out there that
says, my
goodness -- obviously, there are
people who

33:32.844 --> 33:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't want Hillary Clinton and
some people
don't want a woman, but I don't
see that as

33:36.715 --> 33:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a majority in the country.

33:38.583 --> 33:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Hillary
Clinton, David,
has not completely locked up the
Democratic

33:42.454 --> 33:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination yet, but she is
clearly well on
her way.

33:45.991 --> 33:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is he handling this the right
way? She's already
indicating -- I mean, her
campaign is indicating

33:51.696 --> 33:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is something they are
prepared to go
to fight out with Trump all the
way through

33:59.037 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to November.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, this is a
home run for
them.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have printed out these
little women's
cards, things to signify they're
-- how they

34:06.544 --> 34:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going to stand up to this.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And it's a total
winner for
them among suburban swing voter
women. It's

34:11.750 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a total winner.

34:13.652 --> 34:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for Trump, it's not
subliminal. It's
just unconscious. His attitudes
toward women

34:17.455 --> 34:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been entirely consistent
for most of
his life, and this is an
outgrowth of that.

34:21.059 --> 34:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His desire to build a coalition
of resentments,
whether it's ethnic resentments
or class resentments

34:26.331 --> 34:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or any other kind of
resentments, it's his
mode.

34:28.667 --> 34:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so resentments for men who
feel that strong
women somehow are displacing
them in society,

34:33.805 --> 34:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's something he's going to
play to, whether
it helps him or not, because
that's his sincere

34:37.208 --> 34:39.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

34:39.144 --> 34:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is getting ready and
sort of mobilizing,
and all this plays nicely into
her hands.

34:44.516 --> 34:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
Mark, Bernie
Sanders is still there. He's
still campaigning.

34:49.254 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did lay off some of his
campaign workers
this week.

34:55.393 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's now talking more about
what is in
the party the so-called
platform. What does

35:01.166 --> 35:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that mean? What is it that
Bernie Sanders
is going to end up, do you
think, getting

35:06.338 --> 35:08.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from this campaign?

35:08.273 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think, if
you're not
going to win the prize, then you
-- and especially

35:11.743 --> 35:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're a movement candidate
-- and Bernie
Sanders is very much a movement
candidate

35:15.947 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you fight for the soul of the
party, is
what you -- you lower your --
change your

35:20.251 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
target. I won't say lower it.

35:22.387 --> 35:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you do that by fighting.
There has to
be a fight. In other words, you
don't go this

35:27.325 --> 35:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far, this long, this many months
with this
many people engaged and
committed, and then

35:34.132 --> 35:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just meekly fold up your tents
and leave.

35:38.103 --> 35:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you go to the convention in
Philadelphia,
and you fight on the platform. I
mean, you

35:43.375 --> 35:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might lose. There will be a
couple of planks.
There will probably be on
economic regulation,

35:48.747 --> 35:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulation of Wall Street,
whatever. I don't
know exactly what they are,
minimum wage.

35:52.884 --> 35:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Clinton will accept some,
but there will
probably be a fight on others,
but you wanted

35:57.622 --> 35:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have stood for something.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know it's
early, David, but
what does that mean? To win
something in the

36:03.194 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
platform, what can Bernie
Sanders -- and,
again, it's early, but what does
that mean?

36:07.732 --> 36:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can he take away from that?

36:09.501 --> 36:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he's already
got most
of the planks in the ark
already. She's moved

36:13.438 --> 36:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significantly in his direction
on trade and
on focusing on Wall Street and a
series of

36:19.577 --> 36:21.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other issues.

36:21.446 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the things that he would
likely focus
on are two. One is to ask her to
embrace free

36:26.951 --> 36:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college tuition, which has been
a centerpiece
of his campaign. And the
millennials are a

36:31.623 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
centerpiece of his campaign. I
don't know
if she is going to do that, but
that's something

36:34.426 --> 36:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to press for, and then something
on campaign
finance. He's revolutionized the
way campaigns

36:39.631 --> 36:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fund themselves. And so that
would be consistent.

36:41.966 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would see those are the two
things, and
maybe to solidify her support
for the $15

36:46.271 --> 36:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minimum wage. She's sort of
mushy on that
one. But he's had a big effect
already, and

36:50.842 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he may just want a little -- a
few more pieces
to add to the accomplishments
and the trophies

36:54.879 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the wall.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, 20
seconds left.

36:57.916 --> 37:02.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I told you both you could say
something about
the first woman on the coin. It
was announced

37:02.120 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last week. We ran out of time
last Friday.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark?

37:05.657 --> 37:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. And you took
a cheap shot
at us last week, Judy.

37:06.991 --> 37:07.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:07.625 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And I'm...

37:09.360 --> 37:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm giving you a
chance to
either come out for it or
against it.

37:11.896 --> 37:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I -- no, I'm
for Harriet
Tubman. I'm also for Andrew
Jackson. Andrew

37:17.102 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jackson is getting the short end
of the stick,
but I want Harriet Tubman on the
currency.

37:21.206 --> 37:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One word, David.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:23.274 --> 37:25.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Jackson should go,
Hamilton
in, Tubman up.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:26.644 --> 37:40.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, David
Brooks, Mark
Shields, thank you both.

37:40.291 --> 37:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now an update from a man we
first met out
on a walk.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari recently caught up with
him.

37:46.397 --> 37:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last fall, we
took you to
the Southern Caucasus Mountains
in the country

37:50.068 --> 37:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Georgia to meet Paul Salopek.
He is the
two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning
foreign correspondent

37:55.807 --> 37:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on an epic journey he calls the
Out of Eden
Walk.

37:59.344 --> 38:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beginning in the Great Rift
Valley in Africa
in 2013, Salopek is now three
years into a

38:04.349 --> 38:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decade-long walk around the
world. After our
walk with Paul, he crossed
Azerbaijan, and

38:10.455 --> 38:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, around Christmas, hopped a
freighter
across the Caspian Sea, toward
Central Asia.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Paul Salopek joins me again.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul, tell our audience where we
find you
now.

38:19.797 --> 38:23.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK, Journalist,
"National Geographic"
Fellow: Today I'm in the port
city of Aktau,

38:24.035 --> 38:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kazakstan, which is a very
remote and isolated
sort of starting line for the
next Asiatic

38:29.107 --> 38:30.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
phase of the walk.

38:30.909 --> 38:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is kind of where the Silk
Road butted
up against the Caspian Sea. And
you might

38:35.580 --> 38:41.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to hear a little bit of
surf in the
background. And it's a very
off-the-map place.

38:41.352 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's about, I don't
know, 100,000,
150,000 people, an old uranium
mining town

38:47.192 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under the Soviet era.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will be walking due east
from here as
the sun rises towards China.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How long to
get to China?

38:54.132 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: It's going to be
an interesting
passage, if the weather
cooperates. I have

38:58.002 --> 39:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some big mountains to go over.
Maybe as soon
as this coming winter, but more
likely springtime.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about 3,000 kilometers
away.

39:07.979 --> 39:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And these
3,000 kilometers
are different geographically and
topographically

39:12.150 --> 39:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than what you have already
covered, right?

39:13.751 --> 39:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes, they are.
They're very
different.

39:15.920 --> 39:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you recall, the last time I
reported in,
I was in the Caucasus, which is
a very, relatively

39:22.093 --> 39:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavy populated corner of the
world, very
rugged, mountainous, also a
crossroads of

39:27.098 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, lots of different
cultures, languages,
ancient migration, ancient
invasions.

39:33.037 --> 39:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I have before me now is a
pretty arid
plain, a high plateau of dry,
brittle grasses

39:41.546 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with very little water. So it's
going to be
more like an expedition this
time. Rather

39:46.451 --> 39:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than walking from farm to farm,
I'm going
to actually have to camp out and
look for

39:50.888 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water and go into survival mode
on this stretch.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how do you
ensure that
you have enough food and water?

39:57.095 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: I just last
weekend purchased
a cargo horse, a Kazakh horse.
These are very

40:02.667 --> 40:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sturdy little ponies. They can
walk very far
with very little water. And I
will be leading

40:08.973 --> 40:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that animal, and it will be
carrying part
of my water and part of my food.

40:13.878 --> 40:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, I had to do something that
I have not
done since Saudi Arabia. Over
the last many

40:20.084 --> 40:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks, I have had to go out and
actually cache
water, which is a very strange,
a very surreal

40:24.622 --> 40:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience in this gigantic
stage of open
grass and sky.

40:28.626 --> 40:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caching water means driving out
to certain
points along the proposed
walking route and

40:35.867 --> 40:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
digging a hole in the ground and
plucking
in 10 to 15 liters of bottled
water and then

40:40.538 --> 40:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covering it up and taking a GPS
coordinate.
And so going out there and
planning a few

40:46.210 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mouthfuls of water in this
gigantic, operatic
landscape is very strange. It's
kind of like

40:52.016 --> 40:53.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a conceptual art piece.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The storylines
have changed
from when you left Africa and
crossed into

40:57.188 --> 41:01.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Middle East, how our
dependence on our
feet shifted to our dependence
on motorized

41:01.626 --> 41:03.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transportation.

41:03.394 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From a story perspective, what's
changing
about the world around you as
you now head

41:07.398 --> 41:09.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this next phase?

41:09.267 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes, it's true.
I'm not just
heading into a new physical
environment. I'm

41:12.937 --> 41:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heading into a new sort of
chapter in human
history and in sort of a new and
different

41:19.510 --> 41:21.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human relationship with the
landscape.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Caucasus and in Anatolia
in Eastern
Turkey, I was walking through
landscapes that

41:25.883 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were haunted often by human
conflict, by war,
by bloodshed, by massacres. So,
that landscape

41:32.523 --> 41:37.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was kind of spooky, to be
honest. You would
walk through villages with some
empty houses,

41:38.096 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orchards that were no longer
tended, and these
invisible relationships between
ethnic groups

41:43.534 --> 41:48.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you kind to had to suss out
as you're
walking through that fractured
landscape.

41:48.373 --> 41:54.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here, it more a linear
storyline. I'm going
to be literally following in the
footsteps

41:54.345 --> 42:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the old traders who walked
the silk roads
between China and Europe, moving
at a slow

42:00.551 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate along camel trails, kind of
a ghost myself,
moving through a modern
landscape that will

42:06.391 --> 42:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
include gas and oil
developments, that will
include modern highways on
occasion, sporadically

42:12.230 --> 42:13.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming to towns.

42:14.098 --> 42:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will be a dusty figure leading
a horse and
then later, in Uzbekistan, a
camel, through

42:21.406 --> 42:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the modern motorized landscape
of globalization.

42:23.708 --> 42:27.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this an
opportunity for
you to think more deeply about
what it is

42:27.712 --> 42:32.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that you are doing, these
moments where you
are basically alone with your
guide and your

42:32.150 --> 42:33.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
horse?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: You're right. It
is a much more
solitary passage.

42:36.053 --> 42:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for weeks and even
months, we will
be -- my local guides and myself
will be the

42:42.527 --> 42:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only people visible in the
visible world.
And that probably will lead to
more reflective

42:48.766 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sorts of narratives, maybe more
inward narratives,
narratives about nature,
narratives about

42:55.072 --> 42:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nature of moving through
landscapes alone.

42:57.642 --> 43:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think these long solo
passages, these
kind of adagio passages, if you
look at the

43:02.480 --> 43:08.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey as music, will hopefully
allow me
to reflect on where we continue
to walk. So,

43:09.086 --> 43:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will be jumping back and forth
between the
past and the present as I walk
across this

43:14.559 --> 43:18.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
steppe, these grasslands,
looking at human
connections in a little bit
different way

43:18.863 --> 43:20.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than I was, say, a year ago,
coming through
the Caucasus.

43:20.731 --> 43:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Paul Salopek,
we wish you the best on your
journey. Thanks

43:25.303 --> 43:26.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so much for joining us.

43:26.304 --> 43:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Always a pleasure.
Thank you.

43:28.539 --> 43:34.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Salopek's
work and walk
are supported in part by the
National Geographic

43:34.479 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Society and by the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis
Reporting, which often partners
with the "NewsHour."

43:40.551 --> 43:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can find Hari's stories from
last fall
about Paul Salopek on our Web
site. That's

43:45.490 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PBS.org/NewsHour.

43:45.857 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Now: A

44:00.238 --> 44:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new show is opening on Broadway
that is part
homage to an old musical with a
historic role

44:06.177 --> 44:11.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for black performers, and one
that also included
a very complicated racial
legacy.

44:11.849 --> 44:17.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That show is now being
reinvented. "Shuffle
Along" debuted to generally
strong reviews

44:17.488 --> 44:18.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

44:19.090 --> 44:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story
behind a show
that was years in the making.

44:23.127 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just one song,
"I'm Just Wild
About Harry," would last,
largely because

44:29.233 --> 44:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Harry Truman adopted it years
later.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost everything else about
"Shuffle Along,"
the 1921 Broadway musical
written, performed,

44:40.978 --> 44:44.348 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and directed by
African-Americans, was forgotten.

44:44.448 --> 44:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And George Wolfe, one of today's
leading theater
directors, told us that he found
that hard

44:50.121 --> 44:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to accept. We spoke at the famed
Sardi's Restaurant.

44:53.491 --> 44:56.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE WOLFE, Director, "Shuffle
Along": "Shuffle
Along" was the first time there
was a woman's

44:56.561 --> 45:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dancing, hoofing chorus. And I
went, why isn't
this discussed?

45:00.431 --> 45:04.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I went, so this altered
the American
musical. And then I realized it
was the first

45:04.835 --> 45:11.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
jazz score, which then
introduced syncopation
into the American musical. We
know about "West

45:11.742 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Side Story," but don't know
anything -- we
didn't even think to include
"Shuffle Along"

45:16.147 --> 45:17.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this conversation.

45:18.049 --> 45:24.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wolfe has now
created a something
new titled "Shuffle Along or the
Making of

45:24.121 --> 45:31.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Musical Sensation of 1921
and All That
Followed," a musical, that is,
about the musical

45:31.395 --> 45:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Wolfe hopes continues a
conversation
begun by the original show's
creators.

45:36.434 --> 45:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE WOLFE: So, it isn't just,
how do we
present blackness on the
American stage? I

45:41.539 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it's more interesting. How
do we present
who we are in our myriad facets,
by being

45:45.409 --> 45:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black, by being American, by
being Southern,
by being Northern?

45:47.812 --> 45:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're trying to figure out
all these
things not in a calculated way,
but in a -- in

45:54.585 --> 45:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most natural expression of
who they are,
which is their art.

45:57.188 --> 46:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new musical
features an
all-star team of talent, led by
six-time Tony

46:02.293 --> 46:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winner Audra McDonald, who plays
Lottie Gee,
the actress who starred in the
1921 production.

46:09.333 --> 46:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's choreographed by Savion
Glover, the renowned
tap dancer and creator of the
1990s bring

46:13.804 --> 46:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in "Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in
'Da Funk."
He, too, took on the project
with a sense

46:19.076 --> 46:20.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of mission.

46:21.078 --> 46:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAVION GLOVER, Choreographer: I
don't think
anyone has a choice to walk out
of that theater

46:25.850 --> 46:31.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not knowing something that they
didn't come
in with. There's so much
information in the

46:31.355 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
show, something we call
edu-tainment. It's
not just about putting on a
show. It's about

46:37.695 --> 46:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making sure that we continue to
elevate the
minds of this generation, and
then of generations

46:45.069 --> 46:46.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

46:47.004 --> 46:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Four men created
the original
1921 play, composer Eubie Blake
and lyricist

46:51.475 --> 46:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Noble Sissle, writer-actors
Flournoy Miller
and Aubrey Lyles, and brought
new sounds and

46:57.815 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moves to Broadway.

46:59.617 --> 47:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The play introduced onstage
romance between
blacks, rarely, if ever, seen in
the era.

47:04.722 --> 47:10.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also included older elements
of Vaudeville
and black actors in blackface.

47:10.861 --> 47:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tony award winners Billy Porter
and Brian
Stokes Mitchell play the comedy
team of Miller

47:15.833 --> 47:17.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Lyles.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL, Actor:
One of the parts
of the show is that our two
characters performed

47:20.104 --> 47:23.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in blackface, as did many
performers back
then.

47:23.541 --> 47:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's interesting, because it
had a different
context for African-American
performers, because

47:28.846 --> 47:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was more like a -- in a
sense, a mime mask
is. But then those characters
and that style

47:36.787 --> 47:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was usurped by white culture,
who then didn't
really understand, appreciate,
honor that

47:42.660 --> 47:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tradition that it came from, and
it became
a caricature then of black
behavior at the

47:49.567 --> 47:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time, and became offensive.

47:51.435 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY PORTER, ACTOR: You know,
to be truthfully
honest with you, just from
reading the song

47:58.142 --> 48:07.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
titles on the album cover, me
and my black
friends, in our naivete, sort of
rejected

48:07.818 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this show in the way...

48:09.353 --> 48:11.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because?

48:11.155 --> 48:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY PORTER: Because, you know,
they had
songs like "Pickaninny Shoes"
and "Bandanna

48:13.791 --> 48:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Land." And we heard that there
was blackface.
And, you know, without context,
without historical

48:20.598 --> 48:27.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
context to sort of look at it
through that
lens, we immediately rejected
it. And I think

48:28.038 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this has been such an amazing
journey for
me to understand.

48:32.009 --> 48:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The original 1921
"Shuffle
Along" was a Broadway sensation,
bringing

48:37.548 --> 48:43.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white audiences to a story of
and performed
by blacks, playing more than 500
performances,

48:43.654 --> 48:45.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unheard of at the time.

48:45.589 --> 48:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The likes of Josephine Baker and
Paul Robeson
appeared in it, before going on
to international

48:50.995 --> 48:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stardom. Leading white artists
of the day,
including George Gershwin and
Florenz Ziegfeld,

48:56.000 --> 49:01.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came repeatedly and borrowed or
lifted riffs
and moves, another part of
America's cultural

49:01.872 --> 49:03.774 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

49:03.874 --> 49:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a great success, but a
painful aftermath,
as the four creators of the
musical squabbled

49:08.312 --> 49:10.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among themselves and never again
worked together.

49:11.048 --> 49:14.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE WOLFE: I think it's what
makes the
material exciting and why you go
on the journey.

49:14.985 --> 49:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the large idea that
"Shuffle Along"
is about is, will I be
remembered? I came

49:20.424 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into this world with X-amount of
equipment
and X-amount of desires and
dreams and frailties,

49:26.297 --> 49:28.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I tried to do the best I
can.

49:28.199 --> 49:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As opening night
approached,
though, Savion Glover, having
created the

49:32.403 --> 49:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moves the actors will dance to,
had something
more immediate on his mind.

49:36.674 --> 49:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAVION GLOVER: I'm going to
sneak in there
one day to tie somebody up. It
might be Billy

49:40.945 --> 49:42.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Porter.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But we're not
going to know
when.

49:43.247 --> 49:44.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAVION GLOVER: You're not going
to know when.

49:44.815 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, that would
delight theater
and dance fans.

49:47.484 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Music Box Theatre on
Broadway, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:58.829 --> 50:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for our
"NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

50:09.073 --> 50:11.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we thought might be of interest
to you too.

50:11.609 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American bison is poised to
become the
first national mammal of the
United States,

50:17.047 --> 50:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thanks to a bipartisan act of
Congress. The
Senate passed the National Bison
Legacy Act

50:24.421 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by unanimous consent last
evening, following
the House's approval Tuesday.

50:29.593 --> 50:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The act will designate bison,
also known as
buffalo, as a national emblem in
honor of

50:35.199 --> 50:41.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their historical and
contemporary significance.
Tens of millions of bison once
roamed the

50:41.372 --> 50:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation's Great Plains and other
regions. But
hunting, ranching and western
expansion decimated

50:48.245 --> 50:54.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the population, and bison
numbers dwindled
to less than 1,000 by the start
of the 20th

50:54.685 --> 50:56.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
century.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have since rebounded
though, with nearly
a half-a-million bison currently
living in

51:00.724 --> 51:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wild and commercial populations.
More than
50 conservation, ranching and
tribal groups

51:07.798 --> 51:13.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supported the new designation,
even though
the act won't impose any new
protections on

51:13.103 --> 51:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the animals. The bill now heads
to the White
House for President Obama's
signature.

51:19.543 --> 51:25.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour" online:
Yesterday, our columnist
Wendy Thomas Russell explained
why she stopped

51:25.716 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
giving time-outs to her
5-year-old. Today,
she shares 12 alternative
methods of discipline

51:31.755 --> 51:33.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that may help parents.

51:34.058 --> 51:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a Virginia history teacher
challenged
his students to use the past to
talk about

51:39.196 --> 51:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
present-day racism by taking
them to the birthplace
of the student civil rights
movement. Read

51:45.002 --> 51:50.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a recent field trip that
inspired his
class to open up a conversation
about race

51:50.607 --> 51:51.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and inequality.

51:52.076 --> 51:57.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:57.614 --> 52:01.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

52:01.752 --> 52:06.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On "Washington Week": why
Hillary Clinton
took a break from the campaign
trail, and

52:06.724 --> 52:13.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a closer look at how Donald
Trump may be shifting
his strategy to become a more
mainstream candidate.

ERIC LEE, Director, Kimbell Art
Museum: Before
we buy a work of art, we do as
much research

as we can.

52:28.145 --> 52:32.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: After a flurry of
looted art claims,
15 years ago, American museums
adopted guidelines

52:32.182 --> 52:37.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling them how to handle
Nazi-looted art.
The Kimbell decided to review
everything and

52:37.187 --> 52:38.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be transparent.

52:38.422 --> 52:41.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC LEE: It's a sculpture of
extremely high
quality.

NARRATOR: In 2011, Lee was shown
this photograph
of the sculpture in the hands of
a special

allied army unit dedicated to
post-war art
recovery, the Monuments Men, who
found it

52:52.002 --> 52:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stashed with Nazi loot in an
Austrian salt
mine.

52:54.705 --> 52:59.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC LEE: I was completely
floored by this.
We had no idea that the
sculpture had been

52:59.943 --> 53:01.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken by the Nazis.
