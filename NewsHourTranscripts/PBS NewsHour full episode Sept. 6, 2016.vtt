JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.141 --> 00:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
post-Labor
Day election countdown begins.

00:12.045 --> 00:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, I talk with Democratic
vice presidential
nominee Tim Kaine about the
tightening race,

00:18.619 --> 00:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security and Hillary
Clinton's strategy
to win voters' trust.

00:22.789 --> 00:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday: In
a historic visit, President
Obama apologizes

00:27.961 --> 00:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the people of Laos, and
pledges to help
the nation heal after the U.S.
dropped 290

00:35.269 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million bombs there, an average
of eight a
minute, from 1964 to 1973.

00:41.642 --> 00:47.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the rapidly
changing fight
against terrorism 15 years after
9/11.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK RASMUSSEN, Director,
National Counterterrorism
Center: The work we're doing now
with our

00:50.584 --> 00:55.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partners in the intelligence
community often
doesn't involve really, really
sensitive intelligence.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It involves looking at Twitter.

00:57.090 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.695 --> 01:06.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.066 --> 01:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
and Donald
Trump traded new jabs today amid
polls showing

01:19.479 --> 01:22.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the presidential race has
tightened.

01:22.182 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton said there are growing
questions about
Trump's ethics, and she linked
them to his

01:26.954 --> 01:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refusal to release his tax
returns.

01:29.156 --> 01:32.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm going to continue to raise
this, because

01:32.492 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a fundamental issue
about him
in this campaign, that we're
going to talk

01:39.967 --> 01:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about in one way or another for
the next 62
days, because he clearly has
something to

01:48.175 --> 01:50.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hide.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, in Tampa,
Florida, Clinton
charged that Trump's policies
would lead the

01:53.613 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation back to war in the Middle
East.

01:56.516 --> 02:02.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In turn, Trump released an open
letter of
support from 88 retired generals
and admirals.

02:03.023 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Virginia Beach, Virginia,
he belittled
Clinton's argument that she'd be
tougher on

02:07.961 --> 02:09.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the likes of Russia.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Putin looks at her and he
laughs.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He laughs.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin looks at Hillary Clinton
and he smiles.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Boy, would he like to see her.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be easy, because just
look at her
decisions.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look how bad her decisions have
been.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virtually every decision she's
made has been
a loser.

02:29.116 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton and Trump
will appear
separately in a nationally
televised forum

02:34.187 --> 02:36.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on national security tomorrow
night.

02:36.590 --> 02:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: Congress
returned from its August recess
with a full

02:41.661 --> 02:43.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to-do list.

02:43.330 --> 02:47.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the
priority
is to finance the government
past October

02:47.467 --> 02:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1, when the fiscal year begins.

02:49.469 --> 02:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also pressure to approve
money for
fighting the Zika virus.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it all has to get done in
about three
weeks, before lawmakers head
home for the

02:57.611 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
final dash to Election Day.

02:59.713 --> 03:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
was in the
Asian nation of Laos today,
attending a regional

03:04.518 --> 03:08.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summit and pledging to heal
scars from the
Vietnam War.

03:08.922 --> 03:15.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the first sitting American
president
to visit Laos, and he cited a
moral obligation

03:15.128 --> 03:18.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to help the country recover from
heavy U.S.
bombing.

03:18.832 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also met with
South Korea's
president at the summit, a day
after North

03:23.937 --> 03:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korea test-fired more missiles.

03:25.806 --> 03:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We are going to work diligently
together with

03:31.745 --> 03:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most recent U.N. sanctions
that are already
placing North Korea under the
most intense

03:37.751 --> 03:39.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctions regime ever.

03:39.519 --> 03:44.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to work together to
make sure
that we're closing loopholes and
making them

03:44.691 --> 03:46.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even more effective.

03:46.526 --> 03:50.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
U.N. Security
Council strongly condemned the
North Korean

03:50.130 --> 03:52.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missile tests and threatened new
sanctions.

03:52.732 --> 03:57.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Security forces in
Afghanistan
ended a standoff today, killing
three Taliban

03:57.704 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gunmen who seized a building in
Kabul.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left crews to clean up from
a bombing
that began the 11-hour siege.

04:04.678 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The target was a building
housing the aid
group CARE International.

04:08.515 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It all happened hours after twin
bombings
elsewhere in Kabul that killed
35 people.

04:13.386 --> 04:19.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, one of
the biggest for-profit college
chains, ITT

04:19.593 --> 04:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Technical institute, is closing
all of its
130 U.S. campuses.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The announcement today affects
some 35,000
students.

04:28.869 --> 04:33.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, the U.S. Department
of Education
banned ITT from accepting new
students who

04:34.007 --> 04:38.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
use federal aid, over
allegations of poor-quality
programs.

04:38.645 --> 04:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On Wall Street
today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
46 points

04:42.983 --> 04:46.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to close at 18538.

04:46.219 --> 04:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 26 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added six.

04:51.091 --> 04:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And American
conservatives
today marked the passing of a
powerful voice,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Phyllis Schlafly.

04:58.331 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She died yesterday, after more
than half-a-century
of activism on major social
issues.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY, Conservative
Activist: The
Equal Rights Amendment is a dead
issue now.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Phyllis Schlafly
was one of
the leading conservative
firebrands of her

05:11.211 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, especially on the role of
women in American
society.

05:16.016 --> 05:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She rose to prominence in the
early 1960s
with a manifesto for the right,
A Choice,

05:22.455 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not an Echo.

05:24.257 --> 05:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It helped boost Senator Barry
Goldwater to
the top of the 1964 Republican
presidential

05:30.063 --> 05:31.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ticket.

05:31.731 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A decade later, Schlafly led the
drive to
defeat the Equal Rights
Amendment, or ERA.

05:37.604 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have barred gender
discrimination,
but Schlafly warned it wouldn't
stop there.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY: And it is the
position of
the advocates of the Equal
Rights Amendment

05:46.947 --> 05:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they don't want it unless
they get, in
the same package, abortion,
abortion funding,

05:51.751 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gay rights, drafting women.

05:53.620 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Schlafly said she
was defending
what she called the real rights
of women,

05:59.092 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including the right to be in the
home as a
wife and a mother.

06:03.463 --> 06:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her Eagle Forum also
became a force
on other social issues,
opposition to abortion

06:09.769 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chief among them.

06:11.538 --> 06:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY: The Republican
Party must
keep the pro-life plank in the
platform and

06:16.076 --> 06:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must reject any language in the
text or in
the preamble that will be
perceived by the

06:21.815 --> 06:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
press and the public as watering
down our
1984 and '88 platforms.

06:26.820 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And she remained
active into
old age, even appearing at a
rally in march

06:33.059 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Donald Trump.

06:34.494 --> 06:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Phyllis Schlafly died of cancer
at her Saint
Louis home yesterday.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was 92 years old.

06:43.837 --> 06:49.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And still to come on the
"NewsHour": Tim Kaine
discusses his role in the
homestretch of the

06:49.242 --> 06:55.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential campaign; a promise
to clear
unexploded bombs left in Laos
since the Vietnam

06:55.148 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War; FOX News settles a sexual
harassment
suit with Gretchen Carlson; and
much more.

07:05.158 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the race
for the White
House, we turn now to Hillary
Clinton's running

07:17.304 --> 07:19.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mate, Virginia Senator Tim
Kaine.

07:19.539 --> 07:25.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before becoming senator in 2013,
Kaine served
as governor and lieutenant
governor of Virginia

07:25.345 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and mayor of Richmond.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy sat down with Mike Pence
during the Republican
National Convention.

07:30.083 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with Tim Kaine earlier
today after
he delivered a national security
speech.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Senator Kaine.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
You bet, Gwen.

07:38.425 --> 07:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From our account,
listening to
your speech just now, you
mentioned Donald

07:42.395 --> 07:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump 57 times and Hillary
Clinton 29 times.

07:47.133 --> 07:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you the Hillary Clinton
defender in this
campaign or the Donald Trump
attacker?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Well, I'm not a
Hillary Clinton
defender.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a Hillary Clinton promoter.

07:56.409 --> 08:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am also drawing a sharp
contrast with
Donald Trump, because on this
issue of national

08:02.649 --> 08:08.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security, the power of the
president, as commander
in chief and as the nation's
chief diplomat,

08:08.388 --> 08:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the differences are incredibly
stark and very,
very important.

08:12.559 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you
something about
something your Republican
counterpart, Mike

08:16.863 --> 08:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pence, had to say about your
running mate.

08:19.466 --> 08:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that Secretary Clinton
is the most
dishonest candidate for
president since Richard

08:23.937 --> 08:24.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nixon.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's your chance to promote.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Hillary Clinton is
somebody who
has had a passion for families
and children

08:31.544 --> 08:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since she was a kid, in a
Methodist youth
group as a teenager in the
suburbs of Chicago.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what I tell people, Gwen, is
this.

08:38.752 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to know about the
character of
somebody in public life, look to
see if they

08:43.022 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a passion that has animated
them throughout
their life, whether they were in
office or

08:47.293 --> 08:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, whether they were winning
elections or
losing them.

08:50.597 --> 08:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton has that, a
passion to
empower families and kids, and a
desire to

08:55.468 --> 08:59.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
measure health of society by how
families
and kids are doing.

09:00.006 --> 09:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can see this from her
service as a lawyer,
first lady of Arkansas, and
United States

09:05.345 --> 09:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senator, and secretary of state.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I draw that contrast with a
Donald Trump.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the passion that has
animated his life,
other than Donald Trump?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there really isn't one.

09:15.922 --> 09:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that is the important
definition, in
my view, of character in public
life.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you count on somebody?

09:23.129 --> 09:24.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you know what motivates them?

09:24.764 --> 09:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with Hillary Clinton, I
think that's very,
very plain.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why would Mike Pence
say something
like that?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: You know, I'm not
going to pretend
to understand why he would say
it.

09:34.174 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the Nixon analogy is an
interesting
one, because when Mike Pence
mentions Nixon,

09:39.913 --> 09:41.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here's what I think of.

09:41.714 --> 09:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Nixon, under audit,
released his tax
returns, so that the American
public could

09:46.219 --> 09:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at them and know what his
financial situation
was, whether he was following
the law, and

09:51.658 --> 09:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether he was beholden to
anybody.

09:54.294 --> 09:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump promised in 2014
that, if he
ran for president, he would do
the same, but

09:58.765 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's not even willing to do what
Richard Nixon
did.

10:02.368 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the second thing I
think about when
I hear about Richard Nixon is,
Richard Nixon

10:07.140 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a Republican presidential
candidate who
encouraged crooks to commit
espionage against

10:12.879 --> 10:19.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic National
Committee in order
to gain an edge in a
presidential election.

10:19.486 --> 10:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that forged a constitutional
crisis, an
impeachment and a resignation.

10:24.624 --> 10:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has encouraged
Russians to cyber-hack
the United States to give him an
edge in an

10:31.731 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that just shows how serious
and seriously
misguided Donald Trump is.

10:36.436 --> 10:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What evidence do you
have to support
the notion that Donald Trump
directly, other

10:40.306 --> 10:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than that one comment that he
made, but that
he's been in touch with
Russians, has had

10:44.811 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a direct connection with them to
urge them
to affect a United States
election?

10:50.717 --> 10:52.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:52.619 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: That is the evidence,
Gwen, that
he publicly -- not privately --
publicly encouraged

10:56.656 --> 11:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a press conference during the
Democratic
Convention in Philadelphia
Russian hackers

11:01.160 --> 11:05.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get involved and try to find
information
that would help him win the
race.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the evidence.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he repeated it, and then,
when he was
confronted with it, he suddenly
said, well,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was just being sarcastic.

11:13.239 --> 11:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But anybody who would joke about
that, about
espionage committed by the
Russians against

11:19.479 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States to help him in
an election,
that was an example of Donald
Trump showing

11:24.417 --> 11:26.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us who he is.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he thinks that's funny,
then he has
a sense of humor unlike anybody
I have ever

11:29.923 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
met.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But that doesn't
necessarily show
-- that shows him maybe if he
thinks he's

11:33.560 --> 11:35.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being funny.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't necessarily show
that he was
in cahoots with the Russians,
does it?

11:37.564 --> 11:39.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: No, but it shows --
again, it shows
he is publicly encouraging them
to do it.

11:41.267 --> 11:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we know, Gwen, that
he's also -- there's
a series of questions about
business deals

11:45.338 --> 11:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he had -- has with Russia
or Russian
interests that could well be
disclosed if

11:49.876 --> 11:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he disclosed his tax returns,
which he won't.

11:52.745 --> 11:57.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In an extraordinary,
extraordinary turn of
events, his longtime adviser and
campaign

11:57.917 --> 12:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chair had to step down within
the last month
because of very, very
questionable ties to

12:03.756 --> 12:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pro-Russian elements in Russia
and the Ukraine,
including allegations of
undisclosed payments

12:10.396 --> 12:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cash to affect Ukrainian
elections.

12:13.099 --> 12:19.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are a series of
connections between
Donald Trump and his closest
advisers and

12:19.238 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia that at least raise
significant questions.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of those questions could be
answered
if Donald Trump was willing to
release his

12:25.945 --> 12:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax returns, but he's unwilling
to do that.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you add that to his
public encouragement
of Russia, it's got to raise
questions in

12:33.152 --> 12:34.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people's minds.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You see the polls as
much as I
do, Senator, so you know that
there's a wide

12:37.390 --> 12:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gulf of distrust that Americans
feel towards
your running mate.

12:42.028 --> 12:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Joe Biden came out today
and said Hillary
Clinton has got to open her
hearts to Americans.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's, obviously, been in the
eye for a long
time.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think that she has
to do and what
has to be done between now and
November 8

12:53.640 --> 12:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for your ticket to make the case
for her,
instead of the case against
Donald Trump?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Yes, and we are
making the case
for her, Gwen.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm passionate about that,
especially on these
national security issues.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just have to make it every
day in the states
that really count.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, I was in Pennsylvania
and Ohio,
states that are close.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, I'm in North Carolina
making the case.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was campaigning with Hillary
in Ohio yesterday.

13:17.697 --> 13:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're going to make our
case on these
issues, who is best suited to
grow an economy

13:21.567 --> 13:23.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will work for all?

13:23.403 --> 13:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the issue of the day,
who is best
suited to be the commander in
chief, be our

13:27.907 --> 13:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief diplomat, and also the
person who has
the nuclear codes and the
control of the American

13:33.780 --> 13:35.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
military?

13:35.581 --> 13:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just deeply, deeply
important, and
we think when we make that case,
the American

13:39.819 --> 13:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public will be clear on who's
most fit to
be president.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's Hillary Clinton.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As you travel making
that case
through all these battleground
states you

13:46.059 --> 13:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just named, do you find that
voters are more
driven by national security
issues, like you

13:50.396 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talked about today, economic
security issues?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In either case, Donald Trump
seems to be leading
in most recent polls.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:57.403 --> 14:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Well, I think people
are very focused
on the economic issues.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want an economy that works
for everybody.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, we're feeling
good about polls
we're seeing.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some different polls came out
today in different
directions.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the battleground states,
like North
Carolina, we're in there.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're feeling good.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top choice that people want
to ask about
is, who's going to create an
economy that

14:16.956 --> 14:18.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does work for all?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the national security issues
are very
important for two reasons.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, because everybody knows
that we want
to be safe.

14:24.664 --> 14:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, secondly, people see these
issues as
probably the clearest window
into somebody's

14:29.802 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperament, their judgment,
whether they're
steady or volatile.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the national security
issues are a
really good window into the
character of the

14:38.478 --> 14:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person that somebody wants to
have as commander
in chief.

14:41.147 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think those questions
show off Hillary
Clinton's strengths and her
experience very,

14:45.985 --> 14:47.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very well.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why does it seem
like independents
are leaning towards Donald
Trump?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: You know, again, I
see polls, like
in Virginia and other states,
where we're

14:52.859 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing very, very well with
independents.

14:55.495 --> 15:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, again, on the polling
side, I see
polls are close.

15:01.901 --> 15:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the battleground states
that matter,
you know, just Virginia --
Virginia was assumed

15:06.205 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be one of the closest and
most important
battleground states going into
this election.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We like what we see in Virginia.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We like what we see in North
Carolina.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We like what we see in
Pennsylvania and Ohio.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are states that are going
to be close,
but, right now, we like what we
see.

15:20.987 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you
another question
about something Donald Trump had
to say over

15:24.290 --> 15:25.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the weekend.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that Hillary Clinton
didn't look presidential.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he was asked about
that, and he didn't
quite answer what he meant.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think he meant?

15:33.332 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Well, Gwen, I will
quote it precisely.

15:36.636 --> 15:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "Hillary Clinton
doesn't look presidential,
does she, fellows?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does she, fellows?"

15:42.942 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to me, I didn't have a hard
time figuring
out what that meant.

15:47.980 --> 15:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was basically saying that,
because she's
a woman, that she somehow didn't
meet his

15:55.555 --> 15:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standard of what a president
looks like.

15:59.926 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is very, very
easily understood
by the vast majority of people
who heard him

16:05.464 --> 16:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make that comment, and they find
it offensive.

16:07.633 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does it help or hurt
you when
there are veiled or unveiled
comments referring

16:12.738 --> 16:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to your running mate's gender?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:16.342 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Well, you know,
whether it helps
or hurts us, it's bad for our
country, because

16:21.380 --> 16:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we live in a country where we
put our North
Star out there in 1776 and said
that North

16:26.853 --> 16:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Star was going to be equality.

16:28.454 --> 16:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took us 144 years to make the
decision
that that meant women could even
vote.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're 96 years after
that, and thank
goodness we have broken a glass
ceiling and

16:37.897 --> 16:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a major party has nominated a
woman for president.

16:40.933 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for Donald Trump to suggest
-- and he's
suggested it before -- that, for
some reason,

16:45.571 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton couldn't cross
over the hurdle
because of her gender, when we
have stated

16:51.477 --> 16:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that our principle is the
equality principle,
and nations around the world
have been able

16:56.115 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to elect women as heads of
state, I think
that shows that he's living in a
different

17:01.854 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, a time that is not a match
for what
Americans now believe about who
our leaders

17:09.896 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
should be.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Tim Kaine,
the Democratic
vice presidential nominee, thank
you very

17:14.567 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much for joining us.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:17.770 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Thanks so much, Gwen.

17:25.811 --> 17:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, President
Obama is now in Laos, the small
Southeast

17:33.586 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asian nation where the United
States dropped
millions of tons of bombs during
the Vietnam

17:38.958 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We stated at the top of the
program that Mr.
Obama apologized, but he stopped
short of

17:41.694 --> 17:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a formal diplomatic apology
expressing regret.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a speech this morning, Mr.
Obama said the
U.S. would now increase funding
to help clear

17:45.765 --> 17:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bombs that still maim and
kill.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Many of the bombs that were
dropped were never

17:51.704 --> 17:53.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exploded.

17:53.806 --> 17:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, thousands of
Laotians have
been killed or injured, farmers
tending their

17:58.844 --> 18:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fields, children playing.

18:01.847 --> 18:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The wounds, a missing leg or
arm, last a lifetime.

18:06.552 --> 18:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why, as president, I
have dramatically
increased our funding to help
remove these

18:10.856 --> 18:13.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unexploded bombs.

18:14.026 --> 18:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, Laos is clearing
more bombs,
fewer Laotians are being hurt or
killed, and,

18:18.364 --> 18:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
together, we are saving lives.

18:20.533 --> 18:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given our history here, I
believe that the
United States has a moral
obligation to help

18:24.403 --> 18:26.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Laos heal.

18:26.272 --> 18:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now special
correspondent Mike
Cerre reports from Laos on the
American effort

18:31.711 --> 18:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to clean up this deadly legacy.

18:34.914 --> 18:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: A Lao grandfather
who lost his
left hand in 1964 to a UXO,
unexploded ordnance,

18:46.025 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pointing out injuries to his
three grandsons
from a UXO from the same war.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Two of the fingers were
cut off.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The war may have
ended here in
Laos 40-plus years ago, but the
casualties

18:59.405 --> 19:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of war continue on places like
this soccer
field, where some kids just two
weeks ago

19:04.143 --> 19:05.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
found a little bomblet.

19:05.611 --> 19:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They thought it was a ball and
took it home
to play with.

19:09.148 --> 19:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite official U.S. government
denials and
downplaying during the Vietnam
War from 1964

19:14.086 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to '73, the United States
dropped more bombs
per person on Laos than have
been dropped

19:19.725 --> 19:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on any country in the world in
any war.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Defense Department
estimates as much
as two million tons of ordnance
were dropped

19:27.900 --> 19:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Laos, much of it focused on
the Ho Chi
Minh Trail that paralleled the
Vietnamese

19:33.205 --> 19:34.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

19:35.007 --> 19:39.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The North Vietnamese used the
trail network
to transport troops and supplies
into South

19:39.211 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vietnam, where American troops
were fighting.

19:42.548 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was part of the secret war
conducted in
Laos, which remained secret
until one determined

19:49.688 --> 19:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American aid worker made it
public.

19:51.991 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: There is a good deal of
evidence to suggest
that the United States has been
carrying out

19:57.063 --> 20:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most protracted bombing of
civilian targets
in history in Laos.

20:01.767 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: While working in
Laos as an educational
adviser in 1969, Fred Branfman
was struck

20:07.973 --> 20:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the number of refugees
fleeing the countryside
into the capital, Vientiane, at
the height

20:13.946 --> 20:15.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the secret war.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED BRANFMAN, ®MD-BO /Anti-War
Activist:
I estimated at one point that I
had interviewed

20:17.316 --> 20:19.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over 2,000 Laotians.

20:19.585 --> 20:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every single one, every single
one, without
exception, said that his or her
village had

20:24.590 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been destroyed by bombing.

20:26.425 --> 20:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: He also asked the
refugees to
draw pictures of the bombing,
which he used

20:31.397 --> 20:33.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in his testimony.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA, Legacies
of War: So
these were accounts of people
who actually

20:35.935 --> 20:37.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lived under the air war.

20:37.636 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at this point, nobody
outside of Laos
had known what was happening.

20:42.441 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Channapha Khamvongsa
is a Laos
American who left Laos in 1979
with her family

20:48.447 --> 20:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when she was 7 and was raised in
Virginia.

20:51.851 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She left her job at the Ford
Foundation 12
years ago, after she first saw
the refugees'

20:57.323 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drawings, to start a foundation
of her own
to deal with these dangerous
legacies of the

21:02.061 --> 21:03.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

21:03.562 --> 21:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 20,000 people have
been killed or
maimed since the war's end.

21:07.566 --> 21:11.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: What I
realized as I
got older is that America left
behind such

21:11.337 --> 21:13.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a dark legacy here.

21:13.139 --> 21:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt compelled to do what I
can to help
remove the millions of bombs
that are still

21:17.676 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left over from the war.

21:19.678 --> 21:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: According to the
Defense Department's
estimates, 20 to 30 percent of
the bombs dropped

21:23.816 --> 21:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over Laos didn't go off as
designed, whether
that be for a technical
malfunction or having

21:29.155 --> 21:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fallen into a soft rice paddy.

21:31.457 --> 21:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Either way, 25 percent of the
country now
is still contaminated by UXOs.

21:36.962 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: Since
1973, there have
been four deaths here.

21:44.036 --> 21:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This particular field is going
to be used
for agriculture purposes, to
grow fruit trees.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he came across too many
bombies.

21:51.177 --> 21:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he made a request to UXO
Lao to clear
the land.

21:55.881 --> 22:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last two days that they have
worked here,
they have been 42 bombies found
already.

22:01.620 --> 22:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Bombies are the
baseball-size
explosives packed by the
hundreds into larger

22:09.261 --> 22:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cluster bombs designed to open
in midair,
raining the smaller
anti-personnel bombs filled

22:15.668 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with ball bearings and other
shrapnel over
wide swathes of land.

22:24.443 --> 22:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: About 270
million were
originally dropped of the
cluster munitions.

22:38.991 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an estimate of 80 million
still remain
on the land.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, we still have a lot
more to go.

22:44.830 --> 22:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for the villagers here, it's
so important
that their land gets cleared.

22:48.534 --> 22:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: UXO Lao is one of
several ordnance
removal operations that receive
U.S. funding

22:54.473 --> 22:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find and safely remove UXOs
throughout
the country.

22:58.944 --> 23:06.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: I think
one of the challenges
to clearing the Ho Chi Minh
Trail has just

23:06.986 --> 23:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been, again, awareness and
attention.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been clearance over
the last 15
years.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we just need more resources.

23:13.726 --> 23:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Daniel Clune, the
U.S. ambassador
to Laos, believes the
improvement of UXO clearance

23:19.031 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protocols is one the reasons the
U.S. will
be spending more on remediation
efforts here.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL CLUNE, U.S. Ambassador to
Laos: The
substantial increase that the
president has

23:28.440 --> 23:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced for UXO clearance in
Laos from roughly
$15 million a year to $30
million a year,

23:36.448 --> 23:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a doubling, is very significant.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Have we ever paid
reparations
for the bombing that we
conducted here?

23:42.821 --> 23:49.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL CLUNE: We have a
responsibility to
clear the unexploded ordnance
that we left

23:49.728 --> 23:51.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here during the war.

23:51.764 --> 23:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is not to make a
judgment one way
or the other about what happened
here and

23:56.368 --> 23:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who was at fault and who wasn't
at fault.

23:59.138 --> 24:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's simply a question of young
children being
injured or killed as the result
of ordnance

24:08.580 --> 24:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was dropped here in a war
that happened
40 years ago.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: I mean,
President Obama
being here is historic, and it's
the first

24:15.621 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a U.S. president to visit here.

24:18.123 --> 24:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're, I think, elated
that he's going
to bring greater visibility to
this issue.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're hardly done.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even a doubling is not going to
solve this
problem overnight.

24:31.303 --> 24:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's going to take the next
administration
and maybe even the next, the one
after, to

24:36.875 --> 24:38.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really address this issue.

24:38.844 --> 24:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: All agree that no
amount of money,
resources or time could ever
find every unexploded

24:44.183 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bomb in Laos.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ordnance from both World Wars is
still being
found in Europe.

24:49.488 --> 24:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The primary objective here is to
make Laos
safe by focusing UXO efforts on
areas of known

24:55.894 --> 25:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contamination in the more
populated areas
and educating Laos on what to
look for and

25:02.267 --> 25:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who to call when they find
something.

25:05.270 --> 25:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emma Atkinson is the State
Department's program
manager for weapons removal in
Southeast Asia.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA ATKINSON, State Department:
Right now,
we have got about 85 percent of
our funding

25:12.845 --> 25:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that goes to surveying clearance
activities,
with the remainder 15 percent
being split

25:17.349 --> 25:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between survivors assistance and
risk education.

25:19.718 --> 25:24.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: Channapha's
Washington based Legacies
of War Foundation, funded
largely by other

25:24.690 --> 25:30.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lao-Americans, helps the State
Department
identify the local needs and the
mix of local

25:30.262 --> 25:35.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and mostly international
organizations working
on them, from victims
assistance, to counseling

25:35.601 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and job training.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: I think
the Americans
obviously knew a lot about
Vietnam and Cambodia.

25:41.774 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some might have heard about
Laos, but I don't
think they know about the
history of U.S.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
involvement here, and in
particular about
the secret war.

25:50.983 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think very few are aware that
millions of
bombs are still maiming and
killing Laotians

25:57.389 --> 25:58.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're really
concerned about.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD+IT /MD-IT /MIKE CERRE:
Another group
is using soccer to teach local
kids how to

26:03.829 --> 26:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identify UXOs, especially the
small bomblets,
which can be easily confused
with the balls

26:09.168 --> 26:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can play with, as this
third generation
of UXO victims mistakenly did,
with tragic

26:15.941 --> 26:17.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consequences.

26:17.609 --> 26:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNAPHA KHAMVONGSA: As long as
the U.S.
continues to remain committed by
sustaining

26:23.449 --> 26:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and increase its funding as
needed, I think
we will be able to address this
issue hopefully

26:29.455 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our lifetime.

26:31.290 --> 26:35.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS
NewsHour," Mike Cerre
reporting from Xiangkhouang
Province, Laos.

26:35.394 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And staying with the
president's
trip to Asia, we look at a flash
point created

26:40.098 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Mr. Obama by the new
president of the
Philippines.

26:43.669 --> 26:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not only Rodrigo Duterte's
blunt, often
profane style, but how those
words have led

26:49.441 --> 26:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a mounting body count on the
streets of
his country.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

26:55.147 --> 26:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Rodrigo Duterte
arrived at the ASEAN Summit in
Laos with his

26:59.651 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staff in full-damage control
mode.

27:01.820 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day earlier, Duterte used a
profanity about
President Obama, warning him not
to raise

27:07.726 --> 27:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the recent mass killings of drug
suspects
in the Philippines.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN ANDANAR, Philippine
Presidential Communications
Operations Secretary: President
Duterte explained

27:12.831 --> 27:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the press reports that the
-- President
Obama would lecture him on
extrajudicial killings

27:19.238 --> 27:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
led to his strong comments,
which in turn
elicited concern.

27:24.543 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He regrets that his remarks to
the press have
caused much controversy.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the damage
was done.

27:31.817 --> 27:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House had already
canceled a meeting
between the presidents at the
summit.

27:36.722 --> 27:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this centers on the new
leader's war
on drugs.

27:40.158 --> 27:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since he took office at the end
of June, more
than 2,000 people have been
killed by state

27:44.530 --> 27:47.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police, and by vigilantes, in a
sweeping crackdown.

27:47.533 --> 27:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: Plenty
will be killed until the last
pusher is out

27:52.404 --> 27:54.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the streets.

27:54.072 --> 28:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until the drug manufacturer is
killed, we
will continue, and I will
continue.

28:01.280 --> 28:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In addition to
the killings,
hundreds of people have
surrendered to authorities.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reactions in the Philippines
sharply divided.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some Filipinos say they support
the president's
efforts.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): oh,
yes, there
are far fewer addicts now.

28:15.928 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's really good.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Duterte is doing a good job.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's really good for our
country.

28:20.766 --> 28:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But there have
also been
protests against this wave of
violence.

28:24.736 --> 28:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some came last week, when
vigilantes accidentally
killed a drug dealer's
5-year-old granddaughter.

28:29.908 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): All
of us want
to eradicate illegal drugs, but
it should

28:33.812 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be done through due process.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president should understand
that.

28:37.316 --> 28:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Many outside
of the Philippines
have expressed concerns as well,
chief among

28:41.320 --> 28:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the critics, the United States
and the United
Nations.

28:44.456 --> 28:48.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, U.N. human rights
experts said
that claiming you're fighting
illegal drugs

28:48.594 --> 28:52.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
doesn't shield you from
responsibility for
illegal killings.

28:52.531 --> 28:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response to the criticism,
Duterte threatened
to pull the Philippines out of
the U.N.

28:56.802 --> 29:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE: I do not want
to insult you,
but maybe we will just have to
decide to separate

29:01.940 --> 29:03.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the United Nations.

29:03.875 --> 29:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, today,
after arriving
at the summit, the Philippines
president declared

29:07.479 --> 29:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his country will not be cowed.

29:09.915 --> 29:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also clear that his often
profane style
isn't going away.

29:13.719 --> 29:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to President Obama,
he's lashed
out at Filipino judges and
senators, Pope

29:18.924 --> 29:22.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Francis, and U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.

29:22.294 --> 29:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, he went after the
U.S. ambassador
to the Philippines, Philip
Goldberg, who'd

29:26.365 --> 29:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticized him during the
Philippines presidential
campaign.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RODRIGO DUTERTE (through
translator): I had
a fight with their ambassador,
that gay son

29:32.537 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

29:33.538 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He annoys me.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was meddling in the
elections, giving statements
here and there.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You weren't supposed to do that.

29:39.311 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tomorrow, both
Duterte and
President Obama will attend a
gala dinner

29:43.482 --> 29:45.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the ASEAN Summit.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unclear if they will speak
to each other.

29:46.518 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

29:54.292 --> 30:06.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:06.204 --> 30:12.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": 15
years after
9/11, combating a different kind
of terrorism

30:12.244 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
online; and the benefits of
teaching math
to 3-year-olds.

30:17.516 --> 30:24.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: fallout from the
sexual harassment
cases involving FOX News and its
former chief,

30:24.589 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Roger Ailes.

30:26.391 --> 30:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parent company 21st Century Fox
announced
a settlement today with former
FOX News anchor

30:31.697 --> 30:33.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gretchen Carlson.

30:33.799 --> 30:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carlson had charged Ailes and
others at FOX
with harassing her starting back
in 2009.

30:40.038 --> 30:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Multiple sources say that
Carlson will receive
$20 million, and that FOX has
settled other

30:46.745 --> 30:47.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lawsuits.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FOX also issued an apology to
Carlson as part
of the deal.

30:51.650 --> 30:57.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It read -- quote -- "We
sincerely regret and
apologize for the fact that
Gretchen wasn't

30:57.389 --> 31:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treated with the respect and
dignity that
she and all of our colleagues
deserve."

31:02.861 --> 31:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more, I'm joined by Stephen
Battaglio
of The Los Angeles Times.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's in Chicago.

31:09.267 --> 31:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Battaglio, thank you for
being with
us.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remind us first, in brief, what
was it that
Gretchen Carlson alleged?

31:15.874 --> 31:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO, The Los
Angeles Times:
Gretchen Carlson was on FOX News
for 11 years,

31:21.012 --> 31:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first on the FOX morning show,
and then she
had an afternoon show of her
own.

31:24.916 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her contract wasn't renewed in
June of this
year.

31:28.720 --> 31:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And shortly after that, she
filed a lawsuit
in which she said that Roger
Ailes sabotaged

31:34.593 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her career and retaliated
against her because
she rebuffed him when he made
comments of

31:42.134 --> 31:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sexual nature in meetings that
they had
had.

31:45.470 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also said that he was
punishing her because
she complained about a hostile
work environment.

31:51.276 --> 31:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wasn't happy with her --
with how her
co-anchors treated her when she
was on "FOX

31:58.083 --> 31:59.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
&amp; Friends."

31:59.885 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she had very detailed
statements talking
about things that Roger had said
to her of

32:04.923 --> 32:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sexual nature, inappropriate,
and that's
what takes us to where we are
today.

32:10.262 --> 32:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he, of
course, initially
denied all of this, but now with
this settlement,

32:15.801 --> 32:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essentially, the company is
saying, as we
just read, we're sorry, and
acknowledging

32:21.940 --> 32:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that at least a lot of this is
true?

32:24.309 --> 32:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: Well, not
only is the settlement
large, but the apology is
extraordinary.

32:30.949 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is very rare when companies
settle with
employees that they actually
admit wrongdoing

32:37.923 --> 32:39.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and apologize like this.

32:40.025 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It almost never happens in
sexual harassment
cases.

32:44.062 --> 32:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's probably guaranteed that
Gretchen Carlson
required this as part of the
terms for the

32:51.369 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settlement, that she be -- that
it would be
acknowledged that this was how
she was treated.

32:57.542 --> 33:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, $20 million,
as you said,
it's a huge amount of money for
this kind

33:02.848 --> 33:04.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of lawsuit.

33:04.616 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was some reporting today
that Roger
Ailes himself would be liable
for some of

33:09.321 --> 33:10.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there any confirmation of
that?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: I don't think
there's any
truth to it.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Roger Ailes was indemnified by
FOX.

33:18.864 --> 33:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left FOX News with a $40
million severance
package.

33:22.834 --> 33:27.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't think, when they
negotiated that package,
they said, here, Roger, here's
$40 million,

33:27.339 --> 33:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but you may have to give some of
that back
if we settle the lawsuit.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think that's the case.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that 21st Century Fox
paid all of
this.

33:35.614 --> 33:41.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen
Battaglio, what does
it say that FOX decided to
settle this and

33:41.319 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this amount?

33:43.154 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: It says that
they wanted
to avoid a trial, which would
have made this

33:47.192 --> 33:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an ongoing story for months,
perhaps years.

33:51.529 --> 33:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is all that people in the
New York media
circles in New York and
Washington have been

33:57.769 --> 33:58.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talking about.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an ongoing story.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The details get more sordid.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
More women come forward.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
More charges are made.

34:05.710 --> 34:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some may not be true, but it
just gets thrown
into the pot, and it's just --
and I think

34:10.682 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Murdochs, the owners of
21st Century
Fox, want to get past this.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to take FOX News into
the post-Roger
Ailes era.

34:19.190 --> 34:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know that
there are
other allegations that have been
out there

34:23.261 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regarding Ailes and potentially
others at
FOX.

34:26.698 --> 34:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the status of those other
potential
cases?

34:30.235 --> 34:36.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: I'm told that
the -- that
the complaints that came forward
during the

34:36.775 --> 34:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation of Carlson's
complaints have
been settled, and there is a
three-year statute

34:42.614 --> 34:47.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of limitations on sexual
harassment complaints
in New York state.

34:47.585 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, other people may issue
complaints, but
if they're not within that
window, they can't

34:53.425 --> 34:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go forward to litigation.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they think they're covered
there.

34:56.328 --> 35:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is one other case
involving another
FOX News host, Andrea Tantaros.

35:02.267 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FOX says that she wasn't
sexually harassed
and that she was suspended
because of a breach

35:07.772 --> 35:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in contract, or that she's in
breach of her
contract.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they feel that that's a
separate issue,
and they will go to court with
that one, if

35:14.879 --> 35:16.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they need to.

35:16.648 --> 35:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
the effect
of this is on FOX News, on its
fortunes as

35:20.585 --> 35:22.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a news organization?

35:22.620 --> 35:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: The bad news
has certainly
not affected its ratings.

35:27.859 --> 35:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been the number one network
in all of
cable, not just FOX News, pretty
much the

35:32.831 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entire summer, week after week.

35:35.367 --> 35:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They own a certain part of the
audience, a
part of the news audience who
doesn't feel

35:39.671 --> 35:44.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that conservative views are
fairly represented
in the rest of the press.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a niche that they own.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's very dependable for
them.

35:48.246 --> 35:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of those people
probably don't care
about this.

35:51.716 --> 35:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
what do you think
-- what effect do you think this
has on the

35:56.421 --> 36:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culture of television news,
television entertainment,
a culture that would have
permitted something

36:01.726 --> 36:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like this at FOX to happen?

36:04.562 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: Well, you're
actually talking
about the culture of Roger
Ailes.

36:07.565 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to remember, Roger
comes from another
era of show business, when the
casting couch

36:12.370 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was very common, where it wasn't
unusual for
an executive or a producer to
say, young lady,

36:18.877 --> 36:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you spend some special time
with me, it
will be very good for your
career.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was pretty common
in the 1960s
and 1970s.

36:26.885 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that stayed with
Roger until today,
where it is not appropriate,
acceptable, or

36:32.791 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
legal.

36:34.059 --> 36:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We certainly hope
it's not
acceptable anywhere.

36:38.329 --> 36:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stephen Battaglio, we thank you
very much
with The Los Angeles Times.

36:41.433 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN BATTAGLIO: Thanks for
having me.

36:46.838 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This coming weekend
marks 15 years
since the 9/11 attacks.

36:58.850 --> 37:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will spend time in the coming
days showing
how the U.S. is pursuing its
campaign against

37:03.988 --> 37:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism, also the state of the
war in Afghanistan
and the lives of its people.

37:09.494 --> 37:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we begin first with the
first of a two-part
series from Miles O'Brien on the
technological

37:15.400 --> 37:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evolution of terrorism and those
who fight
it.

37:18.336 --> 37:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the focus of the film he
produced for
the PBS program "NOVA"
premiering tomorrow

37:22.607 --> 37:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night, "15 Years of Terror."

37:25.443 --> 37:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, an inside look at the
changing face
of counterterrorism.

37:30.148 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is the room
9/11 built,
the operations center at the
National Counterterrorism

37:36.821 --> 37:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Center just outside Washington,
D.C.

37:38.957 --> 37:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK RASMUSSEN, Director,
National Counterterrorism
Center: On a 24/7 basis, we have
officers

37:42.360 --> 37:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here working in shifts who are
consuming,
reading, analyzing, and
assessing every bit

37:47.866 --> 37:51.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of available information that
there is to
try to figure out what terrorist
threats are

37:52.003 --> 37:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aimed at the United States.

37:53.238 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Nick Rasmussen is
the director
here.

37:57.442 --> 38:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency itself, and this room
in particular,
were created to encourage the
myriad of intelligence,

38:03.848 --> 38:09.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military and law enforcement
organizations
involved in national security to
share classified

38:09.954 --> 38:11.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is where they try to
connect the dots.

38:13.958 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK RASMUSSEN: So, there are
probably officers
at NCTC from 17 or 18 different
government

38:20.765 --> 38:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations all across the
government.

38:23.168 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, every three- or
four-letter agency
that you could probably name, we
probably

38:28.039 --> 38:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have somebody here at NCTC
serving from that
organization on a one- or two-
or three-year

38:33.378 --> 38:35.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assignment.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The nature of the
work here
has changed dramatically in
recent years.

38:38.283 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: These folks can get
radicalized by one
group and the baton can be
passed to another

38:42.053 --> 38:43.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The FBI had this man on
its radar as
early as 2013.

38:45.223 --> 38:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: More lone wolves,
fewer face-to-face
meetings and phone calls, the
Internet as

38:50.895 --> 38:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a source of inspiration and
planning.

38:53.064 --> 38:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Self-radicalization doesn't
have to take
many months or many years.

38:56.935 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK RASMUSSEN: Increasingly,
what connecting
the dots means to me is dealing
with the huge,

39:02.574 --> 39:08.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
huge volume of publicly
available or open
source or unclassified
information that's

39:08.947 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out there that may have
terrorism relevance.

39:11.216 --> 39:15.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the work we're doing now
with our partners
in the intelligence community
often doesn't

39:15.086 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involve really, really sensitive
intelligence.

39:17.789 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It involves looking at Twitter
or looking
at some other social media
platform and trying

39:24.495 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to figure out who that
individual behind that
screen name, behind that handle
might actually

39:29.567 --> 39:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be and whether that person poses
a threat
to the United States.

39:32.270 --> 39:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The term of art
in the world
of espionage is SOCMINT, social
media intelligence,

39:40.411 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
open source spying.

39:42.247 --> 39:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS, Intelligence
Analyst: Anybody
can track a war online, can
track a terrorist

39:45.984 --> 39:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group online, can develop
informants and contacts
online.

39:52.490 --> 39:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Intelligence
analyst Jeff Weyers
is expert at gleaning
intelligence from social

39:58.496 --> 39:59.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

39:59.864 --> 40:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His operations center is his
living room.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The data is hiding in plain
view.

40:06.004 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All it takes is patience,
persistence and
a little bit of technical
know-how to find

40:11.476 --> 40:13.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

40:13.311 --> 40:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, many Islamic State
fighters
do not disable the geographic
tracking capability

40:18.816 --> 40:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
built into their mobile phones.

40:20.618 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS: Some, I think, do
it by error,
so that they don't realize that
their phone

40:25.189 --> 40:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is broadcasting the information,
or they simply
don't care.

40:28.826 --> 40:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we look at Raqqa and
Mosul over the
last year, there was lots of
content, lots

40:36.034 --> 40:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of geolocated content coming out
of those
areas.

40:38.903 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The technology
makes it easy
for anyone to track a terrorist.

40:42.607 --> 40:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS: If he broadcasts
from Raqqa,
and then I again see him in
Turkey, and then

40:46.711 --> 40:51.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I again see him moving into
Europe, well,
this is a way that we can
potentially interdict

40:51.616 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with somebody that may be
looking to do an
attack.

40:54.652 --> 41:00.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That, combined
with some selfies,
might provide plenty of
intelligence needed

41:00.058 --> 41:01.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for targeting.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS: If you are looking
for a drone
attack, and you're seeing where
they're going

41:04.195 --> 41:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for morning coffee, Twitter
could tell you.

41:06.497 --> 41:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When it comes to
terror, the
problem isn't a lack of data.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is separating the wheat from
the chaff.

41:13.638 --> 41:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK RASMUSSEN: If you look at
the Orlando
shooting or Baton Rouge or the
recent cases

41:20.345 --> 41:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Germany and France, just
because the government
has all this data doesn't mean
they have the

41:24.749 --> 41:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capacity to analyze all that
data.

41:27.285 --> 41:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how do you then go and make
a determination
as to whether that person poses
a threat to

41:32.990 --> 41:34.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the public.

41:34.792 --> 41:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: With so many
electronic bread
crumbs scattered out in the
open, couldn't

41:39.697 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it be possible for computer
scientists to
harness the right combination of
software

41:44.669 --> 41:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and hardware to find them...

41:46.604 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM CRUISE, Actor: All right,
Howard Marks,
where are you?

41:49.340 --> 41:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: ... and make
pre-crime arrests,
as depicted in the 2002 movie
"Minority Report."

41:56.514 --> 42:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM CRUISE: I'm placing you
under arrest for
the future murder of Sarah Marks
and Donald

42:00.151 --> 42:03.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dubin that was to take place
today, April
22, at 0800 hours.

42:03.688 --> 42:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Provocative, dark
science fiction
now, but maybe not forever.

42:10.495 --> 42:13.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the University of Maryland,
computer scientist
V.S.

42:13.831 --> 42:18.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Subrahmanian is applying a big
data approach
to fighting terror.

42:18.136 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is trying to put more
objective analysis
into decisions about which
terrorists to target.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN, University of
Maryland: I'm
a scientist, and when somebody
says we degraded

42:28.446 --> 42:34.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-Qaida by taking person X out,
if I can't
measure it, I don't believe it.

42:34.252 --> 42:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He and his team
focused on
the Islamic terror organization
Lashkar-e-Taiba,

42:42.326 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the group responsible for the
2008 attacks
on Mumbai, a dozen coordinated
shootings and

42:48.666 --> 42:53.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bombings lasting four days that
killed more
than 160 people.

42:53.171 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: So, what you see
here is the
terrorist network corresponding
to the terrorist

42:57.708 --> 43:00.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.

43:00.077 --> 43:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And each node that you see here
corresponds
to an individual.

43:04.182 --> 43:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They compiled 21
years of data
on the group and its actions.

43:09.787 --> 43:16.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of it is fed into some
sophisticated software,
an algorithm, that he calls
STONE, for Shaping

43:16.561 --> 43:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Terrorist Organization Network
Efficacy.

43:20.698 --> 43:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a schematic of a terrorist
network, identifying
individuals, subgroups and
affiliations.

43:28.473 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The software assigns a number to
measure the
lethality of the terror
organization, the

43:33.878 --> 43:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher the number, the more
dangerous the
group is.

43:37.081 --> 43:38.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: Let's take a look
at the leader
of the group here, number one.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you right-click on him, we
will see some
information about him.

43:43.955 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He is Hafiz
Muhammad Saeed,
a man with a $10 million bounty
on his head.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

43:51.229 --> 43:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: Let's pretend we
are in the
role of an analyst and we're
considering the

43:53.531 --> 43:57.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consequences of targeting him
and removing
him from the network.

43:57.101 --> 44:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Here's what
surprising: The
software predicts, if you take
out the boss,

44:01.906 --> 44:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lethality of the terror
group actually
goes up.

44:04.742 --> 44:06.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

44:06.711 --> 44:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: You may be faced
with a situation
where the new leader is either
much more aggressive

44:10.882 --> 44:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about carrying out operations or
much better
liked or much more competent in
carrying out

44:16.487 --> 44:18.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those operations.

44:18.322 --> 44:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But what would
happen if Saeed's
three top deputies were all
taken out?

44:21.893 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The number goes way down.

44:24.428 --> 44:27.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lashkar-e-Taiba becomes much
less of a threat.

44:27.064 --> 44:28.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: You can have a
much more efficient
counterterrorism operation that
significantly

44:31.969 --> 44:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weakens a group by targeting
just the right
people.

44:34.539 --> 44:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, could the
same software
one day predict an attack?

44:39.377 --> 44:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it possible to identify
surefire signals
of trouble ahead?

44:43.180 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sort of.

44:44.448 --> 44:45.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.S.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUBRAHMANIAN: We could have
predicted the
Mumbai attacks.

44:47.552 --> 44:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, we could not have
predicted exactly
where they would have occurred.

44:51.889 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we can say things like, we
expect these
kinds of targets to be hit in
the next one,

44:59.096 --> 45:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two, three, four months, but we
cannot say,
this specific target will be hit
in the next

45:05.803 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one, two, three, four months.

45:07.672 --> 45:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not as accurate
as a hurricane
prediction, but human nature may
be the perfect

45:12.009 --> 45:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
storm of unpredictability.

45:15.680 --> 45:19.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

GWEN IFILL: And tune in tomorrow
night, when
Miles continues his look at the
efforts to

45:23.921 --> 45:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stem the tide of terrorism
online and asks
what social media platforms can
and should

45:30.194 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

45:31.929 --> 45:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can watch his entire film,
"9/11: 15 Years
of Terror," on "NOVA" Wednesday
night.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Students in
Boston are heading
back to the classroom this week,
where the

45:51.349 --> 45:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school district's youngest
learners are taking
on math in a whole new way.

45:56.954 --> 46:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports for
our weekly education segment,
Making the Grade.

46:02.226 --> 46:03.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Ready, go.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILDREN: One, two, three, four,
five.

46:06.230 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The scene may look
like indoor recess,
but these preschool students are
jumping joyfully

46:11.402 --> 46:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a lesson in mathematics.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Who's getting warmed up
now?

46:14.772 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Even the teachers in
this Boston
public elementary are warming up
to the idea

46:18.809 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of math instruction for 3-, 4-
and 5-year-olds.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Beautiful.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Sara Gardner teaches
pre-kindergarten
at Edward Everett School.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA GARDNER, Edward Everett
School: The curriculum
activities, they're fun.

46:28.152 --> 46:29.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're fun.

46:29.954 --> 46:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a teacher, you really get
to dig deeply
into the development of math and
math ideas

46:34.925 --> 46:36.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in young kids.

46:36.894 --> 46:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Boston schools have
adopted a curriculum
called Building Blocks, which
encourages kids

46:40.831 --> 46:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to think about and discuss math
concepts throughout
the day.

46:46.704 --> 46:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Linda Ruiz Davenport directs

46:50.141 --> 46:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA RUIZ DAVENPORT, Boston
Public Schools:
Getting young children involved
in mathematics

46:52.777 --> 46:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at an early age helps foster
their curiosity
about mathematics, particularly
mathematics

46:59.417 --> 47:00.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their environment.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: All right, no
skipping, count
at one time.

47:02.753 --> 47:04.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

47:04.555 --> 47:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Here, Gardner has
students explain
math mistakes by their puppet,
Mr. Mix-Up.

47:08.559 --> 47:13.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: One, two, five,
six, nine, 11.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILDREN: No.

47:14.532 --> 47:17.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: You did it wrong.

47:17.535 --> 47:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: I don't understand
what I did,
though.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't understand.

47:24.308 --> 47:30.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Like, you need to say,
the correct
words and correct names.

47:30.815 --> 47:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: Mr. Mix-Up, he is
making counting
errors, and so the children are
trying to

47:36.320 --> 47:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn how to explain to him what
those errors
are as they're building up their
understanding

47:41.492 --> 47:43.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the number system.

47:43.327 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Building Blocks was
designed by
early learning experts who say
math has been

47:46.597 --> 47:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largely ignored in the United
States, pushed
out by literacy, a subject some
refer to as

47:51.802 --> 47:55.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the bully of preschool
curriculum, because
it dominates the day.

47:55.072 --> 47:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG CLEMENTS, University of
Denver: Research
shows that kindergarten mostly
is a mathematical

47:59.143 --> 48:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wasteland right now for kids.

48:01.112 --> 48:07.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, kids knew that
stuff before
they walked into the
kindergarten door.

48:07.451 --> 48:08.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they learning?

48:08.786 --> 48:10.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Almost nothing.

48:10.621 --> 48:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Doug Clements is an
early learning
expert at the University of
Denver and one

48:15.726 --> 48:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the creators of Building
Blocks.

48:17.294 --> 48:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUG CLEMENTS: Early math is
surprisingly
important.

48:20.898 --> 48:26.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What kids know in their
preschool or entering
kindergarten year about
mathematics predicts

48:26.370 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their later school success.

48:28.305 --> 48:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In mathematics, sure, that makes
sense, but
it even predicts later reading
success, as

48:32.943 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well as early literacy skills
do.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Early math is cognitively
fundamental.

48:38.215 --> 48:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just about number and
shapes.

48:40.217 --> 48:46.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's reasoning and thinking
embedded in
what we do in early mathematics
that forms

48:46.090 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a foundation for years to come.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: All right, watch
me.

48:50.194 --> 48:51.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How many now?

48:51.262 --> 48:52.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILDREN: Five.

48:52.263 --> 48:54.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: How do you know
it's five?

48:54.698 --> 48:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As they play this game, they
become quicker
and quicker at identifying
quantity, and seeing

48:59.036 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quantity in different
arrangements.

49:02.006 --> 49:02.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How many are here?

49:03.007 --> 49:04.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Six.

49:04.074 --> 49:05.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARA GARDNER: Watch me.

49:05.075 --> 49:06.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How many now?

49:06.076 --> 49:07.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Seven.

49:07.077 --> 49:08.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARA GARDNER: Watch me.

49:08.078 --> 49:09.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How many now?

49:09.079 --> 49:10.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Eight.

49:10.815 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: University of Denver
professor Julie
Sarama is co-creator of Building
Blocks.

49:12.716 --> 49:15.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's also an expert in
childhood learning
and is married to Doug Clements.

49:15.753 --> 49:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE SARAMA, University of
Denver: Children
love talking about mathematics.

49:19.223 --> 49:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We go way beyond what's the
answer, to, how
did you think about that, how
did you get

49:25.162 --> 49:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that answer, what were you
thinking?

49:26.163 --> 49:27.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: How about these,
Maurice?

49:27.398 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are these?

49:28.465 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you know they're
rectangles?

49:31.235 --> 49:33.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Because they have four
sides.

49:33.838 --> 49:36.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: They have four
sides, but what
else?

49:36.106 --> 49:37.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Right angles.

49:37.808 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARA GARDNER: Four right angles.

49:38.809 --> 49:39.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oh, my goodness.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Give me a high-five.

49:41.712 --> 49:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Comfortable as Sara
Gardner is with
her students, not all early
education teachers

49:45.349 --> 49:47.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
embrace math.

49:47.117 --> 49:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE SARAMA: You talk to them
as adults,
they will say, I never liked
math, I'm not

49:50.221 --> 49:52.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a math person.

49:52.089 --> 49:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Susan Neuman, a
professor of early
literacy at New York University,
advises teams

49:58.562 --> 50:00.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of early education
teacher-coaches.

50:00.431 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the teacher she's
observing on this
day get high marks for her
style, Neuman describes

50:06.036 --> 50:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visiting other classrooms where
pre-K teachers
have struggled to teach even
basic math concepts.

50:11.408 --> 50:15.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN NEUMAN, New York
University: The teacher
actually said to the children, a
triangle

50:15.346 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has three sizes, rather than
three sides.

50:20.351 --> 50:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the coach actually had
to go to the
blackboard and draw it, and show
that it had

50:26.390 --> 50:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three sides, rather than three
sizes.

50:29.660 --> 50:33.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet the teacher then repeated,
it has three
sizes.

50:33.864 --> 50:40.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: How important is the
teacher's own
comfort level with math when
they are teaching

50:40.337 --> 50:41.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
math to preschoolers?

50:41.772 --> 50:45.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN NEUMAN: It's
extraordinarily important.

50:45.743 --> 50:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to feel comfortable,
but they also
have to like it.

50:49.280 --> 50:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to understand things
from an understanding
of not only the topic itself,
such as math,

50:57.254 --> 51:00.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but how children learns about
that topic.

51:00.057 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: That was apparent at
this professional
development class sponsored by
Boston Public

51:05.195 --> 51:10.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schools, where pre-K teacher
Stephanie Kudria-Shova
was learning how to teach the
Building Blocks

51:10.567 --> 51:11.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
curriculum.

51:11.568 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is your own relationship
with math?

51:13.470 --> 51:14.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you view math?

51:14.939 --> 51:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHANIE KUDRIA-SHOVA, Teacher:
Honestly,
I hate math.

51:18.976 --> 51:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My instructors would say,
Stephanie, don't
say that.

51:21.745 --> 51:27.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been working really hard
not to be
math-phobic, and coming to
workshops like

51:27.518 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Building Blocks has helped me as
an adult.

51:29.753 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Do you think back on
your own childhood,
and your own education about
math, and think,

51:34.625 --> 51:36.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gosh, I wish I had learned this?

51:36.060 --> 51:38.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHANIE KUDRIA-SHOVA: I wish
all the time.

51:38.495 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, you know, I actually
at one point
started getting nervous, and
sweating, because

51:43.267 --> 51:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they gave us something to do,
and I was like,
oh, no.

51:45.602 --> 51:48.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: You often hear about
fads in education.

51:48.305 --> 51:52.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
School districts will be
rah-rah, spend a
lot of money implementing these
curriculums,

51:52.142 --> 51:54.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then they fade out, for
whatever reason.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a possibility here?

51:55.980 --> 51:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUG CLEMENTS: Yes, it's true,
curriculum
come and go.

51:59.016 --> 52:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we have got to get away
from jumping
on the bandwagon, and then
jumping on a new

52:04.655 --> 52:06.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bandwagon.

52:06.523 --> 52:10.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Curriculum may go, but the
understandings,
the scientific research based
understanding

52:10.928 --> 52:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of how kids learn and how you
can best support
that learning should stay.

52:16.300 --> 52:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Education experts are
now waiting
for new research, expected later
this year,

52:23.173 --> 52:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the lasting impacts of early
math instruction.

52:26.410 --> 52:29.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Boston, I'm Cat Wise for the
"PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: We trace the political
impasse in Congress

52:45.496 --> 52:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over funding to prevent and
fight the Zika
virus in the U.S.

52:50.134 --> 52:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:53.070 --> 52:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Later tonight on
PBS, continuing
our coverage of 9/11 15 years
later, we air

52:59.643 --> 53:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a documentary focusing on the
events in and
around Washington that horrific
day; "9/11:

53:05.449 --> 53:10.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the Pentagon" uses
first-hand accounts
and rarely seen footage to
describe what happened

53:10.487 --> 53:15.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after American Airlines Flight
77 slammed
into the Department of Defense.

53:15.793 --> 53:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: From where I was standing,
you could
see these Navy personnel who had
come to help

53:23.300 --> 53:28.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pull people out of the damaged
area, which
was the Navy command center.

53:28.405 --> 53:34.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When a plane came to it, if you
can imagine,
a room full of partition
furniture, and you

53:34.978 --> 53:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this force coming through
there, it's
taking all of that furniture and
people -- people

53:42.252 --> 53:46.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and everything.

53:46.623 --> 53:48.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just horror popped out.

53:48.225 --> 53:52.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were kind of in that area
where everything
had been shoved into.

53:52.796 --> 53:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The hour-long
program premieres
tonight at 8:00 on most PBS
stations.

53:58.802 --> 54:00.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:00.671 --> 54:01.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:05.609 --> 54:15.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
