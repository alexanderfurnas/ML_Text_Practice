WEBVTT

00:11.300 --> 00:14.400
>>> ON THIS EDITION, AID
OFFICIALS PREPARE FOR A NEW

00:14.400 --> 00:17.067
FLOOD OF REFUGEES FROM SYRIA.

00:17.067 --> 00:20.900
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,
ISRAEL'S HUGE ENERGY DISCOVERY.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.833
HOW WILL IT CHANGE LIFE THROUGH
THERE?

00:22.833 --> 00:25.800
>> THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF
TAKING ALL THE CARS OFF THE ROAD

00:25.800 --> 00:26.933
IN ISRAEL FOR OVER A YEAR.

00:26.933 --> 00:34.933
>> AND WHY WERE SEATTLE POLICE
HANDING OUT BAGS OF DORITOS?

00:34.933 --> 00:39.933
NEXT ON PBS "NEWSHOUR WEEKEND."

00:39.933 --> 00:44.833
>>> FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS PBS
"NEWSHOUR WEEKEND."

00:44.833 --> 00:46.667
>> GOOD EVENING, THANKS FOR
JOINING US FOR THE DEBUT OF THE

00:46.667 --> 00:50.300
PBS "NEWSHOUR WEEKEND." I'M HARI
SREENIVASAN.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.833
WE HOPE TO BE WITH YOU FOR MANY
YEARS TO COME.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.167
PRESIDENT OBAMA RETURNED HOME
LATE LAST NIGHT FROM RUSSIA

00:56.167 --> 01:01.200
AFTER FAILING TO PERSUADE
SEVERAL WORLD LEADERS ATTENDING

01:01.200 --> 01:03.500
THE G-20 MEETING TO GO ALONG
WITH HIS PLAN TO ATTACK SYRIA.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.667
BUT TODAY IN HIS WEEKLY RADIO
ADDRESS, THE PRESIDENT MADE

01:06.667 --> 01:10.033
ANOTHER APPEAL FOR SUPPORT, THIS
TIME TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

01:10.033 --> 01:11.300
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.167
>> I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE WEARY AFTER A DECADE OF WAR.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.233
EVEN AS THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS
ENDED AND THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN

01:16.233 --> 01:18.233
IS WINDING DOWN.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.433
THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR
TROOPS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEBODY

01:20.433 --> 01:23.267
ELSE'S WAR.

01:23.267 --> 01:26.200
BUT WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.933
WE CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO
IMAGES LIKE THE ONES WE'VE SEEN

01:30.933 --> 01:30.367
>> SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
MADE HIS OWN CASE FOR A MILITARY

01:30.367 --> 01:34.667
OUT OF SYRIA.

01:34.667 --> 01:41.000
STRIKE AGAINST BASHAR AL ASSAD'S
REGIME DURING A MEETING OF

01:41.000 --> 01:44.767
EUROPEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS IN
LITHUANIA TODAY.

01:44.767 --> 01:48.433
AFTERWARDS, AN OFFICIAL FOR THE
GROUP SAID THE ATTACK WHICH

01:48.433 --> 01:53.500
KILLED 1,400 SYRIANS CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.133
>> IN THE FACE OF THE THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, THE

01:56.133 --> 01:59.533
INTERNATIONAL XHUNTD CANNOT
REMAIN IDLE.

01:59.533 --> 02:03.633
A CLEAR AND STRONG RESPONSE IS
CRUCIAL.

02:03.633 --> 02:08.867
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT SUCH CRIMES
ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT THERE

02:08.867 --> 02:09.833
CAN BE NO IMPUNITY.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.567
>> BUT THE STATEMENT STOPPED
SHORT OF ENDORSING AN ATTACK

02:11.567 --> 02:14.033
AGAINST ASSAD.

02:14.033 --> 02:20.700
INSTEAD IT EMBRACED FRENCH
PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE'S

02:20.700 --> 02:27.200
STATEMENT THAT A STRIKE SHOULD
COME AFTER INSPECTORS ISSUED

02:27.200 --> 02:30.033
THEIR FINDINGS.

02:30.033 --> 02:34.500
HOLLANDE WAS A SUPPORTER OF AN
AMERICAN-LED ATTACK ON SYRIA.

02:34.500 --> 02:38.733
WITH ALL THE TALK OF WAR, AT THE
VATICAN TODAY, POPE FRANCIS HELD

02:38.733 --> 02:44.933
A PEACE VIGIL AND URGED AN END
TO THE WAR IN SYRIA THAT'S LEFT

02:44.933 --> 02:47.433
100,000 PEOPLE DEAD.

02:47.433 --> 02:51.567
THE WAR LED TO A MASS EXODUS
FROM SYRIA.

02:51.567 --> 02:59.400
2 MILLION SYRIANS HAVE SOUGHT
REFUGE IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.800
WHAT'S LIFE LIKE IN A REFUGEE
CAMP IN JORDAN?

03:05.800 --> 03:12.900
KRISTEN GLEPS PI GILLESPIE MET A
WOMAN THERE.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.367
>> DID THEY BOMB THEM TODAY?

03:15.367 --> 03:19.900
IT'S BEEN MONTH SINCE DALLALA
LAST SAW HER HUSBAND.

03:19.900 --> 03:24.067
IN JANUARY, SHE SAYS, GOVERNMENT
FORCES ATTACKED THEIR VILLAGES

03:24.067 --> 03:26.833
IN A REBEL-CONTROLLED AREA IN
SOUTHWESTERN SYRIA.

03:26.833 --> 03:32.967
SEVERAL OF THEIR RELATIVES,
INCLUDING CHILDREN WERE KILLED.

03:32.967 --> 03:36.533
A SHORT TIME LATER, SHE DMRED IT
WILL COUNTRY WITH HER OWN KIDS.

03:36.533 --> 03:40.267
HER HUSBAND STAYED BEHIND.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.833
>> Translator: I CAME TO JORDAN
IN SPITE OF MYSELF.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.500
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BUT MY
HUSBAND MADE ME FOR THE SAKE OF

03:46.500 --> 03:48.733
OUR CHILDREN SO THAT THEY CAN
STAY SAFE.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.800
HE SAW HIS BROTHER'S CHILDREN
GETTING KILLED.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.600
AND HE TOLD ME TO RETURN.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.300
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHERE SHE
CAME, TO THIS REFUGEE CAMP,

03:57.300 --> 03:59.167
ABOUT TEN MILES ACROSS THE
BORDER FROM SYRIA IN NORTHERN

03:59.167 --> 04:00.967
JORDAN.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.200
THE CAMP OPENED OM A YEAR AGO.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.133
BUT AS THE CIVIL WAR BACK HOME
ESCALATED, ITS POPULATION HAS

04:05.133 --> 04:07.067
SWELLED.

04:07.067 --> 04:11.500
THE CAMP HAS GROWN SO LARGE TO
MORE THAN 120,000 PEOPLE THAT IT

04:11.500 --> 04:13.533
ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE A CITY.

04:13.533 --> 04:18.333
THE CAMP IS TODAY THE FOURTH
MOST POPULOUS PLACE IN JORDAN.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.400
ALL ALONG THIS ROAD, SHOPS HAVE
OPENED ON A STREET WHERE THE

04:21.400 --> 04:29.667
FRENCH GOVERNMENT OPENED A
HOSPITAL.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.867
IT IS NOW THE SECOND LARGEST
REFUGEE CAMP IN THE WORLD.

04:32.867 --> 04:37.000
AND THAT HAS PUT A STRAIN ON
NEARBY COMMUNITIES IN JORDAN

04:37.000 --> 04:38.967
WHERE WATER IS OFTEN SCARCE.

04:38.967 --> 04:42.700
THE SURGE IN THE REFUGEE
POPULATION HAS ALSO SEVERELY

04:42.700 --> 04:45.000
TAXED HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS, SAYS
EVA McDONALD OF THE UNITED

04:45.000 --> 04:46.967
NATIONS.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.933
>> IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT THESE PEOPLE, WE HAVE

04:49.933 --> 04:52.300
GOT TO BE WELL-FUNDED.

04:52.300 --> 04:56.233
AND THE DELIVERY OF WATER AND
THE DELIVERY OF FOOD EVERY DAY,

04:56.233 --> 05:03.333
THE PROVISION OF SHELTER,
SOMETHING A FAMILY CAN CALL A

05:03.333 --> 05:05.400
TEMPORARY HOME.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.467
A SHELTER THAT THEY CAN STAND UP
STRAIGHT IN.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.800
EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF SERVICE
DELIVERY IN THIS KIND OF

05:11.800 --> 05:13.733
ENVIRONMENT IS INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT.

05:13.733 --> 05:15.133
>> Reporter: LIFE IS CERTAINLY
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE THEY ARE

05:15.133 --> 05:19.100
TRYING TO HELP.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.500
SHE AND NINE OTHERS LIVE IN THIS
TIN SHED.

05:22.500 --> 05:27.300
THEY SLEEP IN MATTRESSES ON THE
FLOOR, USE COMMUNAL BATHROOMS

05:27.300 --> 05:30.733
AND RELY ON A GAS CYLINDER TO
COOK.

05:30.733 --> 05:33.633
THEY GET THREE RATIONS OF OIL,
SUGAR, TEA AND RICE.

05:33.633 --> 05:39.833
WHEN WE VISITED, SHE WAS COOKING
ZUCCHINI STUFFED WITH RICE.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.900
SHE CAN PURCHASE VEGETABLES AND
OTHER ITEMS AT SHOPS IN THE

05:41.900 --> 05:44.733
CAMP.

05:44.733 --> 05:47.000
>> Translator: OUR LIFE HERE IS
HARD, REALLY HARD.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.333
WE HAVE SO LITTLE.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.400
I NEED TO WORK TO SUPPORT MY
DAUGHTERS.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.467
I HAVE TO FEED SIX GIRLS.

05:53.467 --> 05:55.200
>> Reporter: WE ASKED HER
13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER ABOUT HER

05:55.200 --> 05:57.133
LIFE IN THE CAMP.

05:57.133 --> 05:59.500
>> Translator: IT IS NOT GOOD.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.667
OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN HERE.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.267
THERE WE GO TO SCHOOL.

06:02.267 --> 06:04.200
WE GO TO OTHER PLACES.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.067
WE GO OUT AND PLAY WITH OUR
FRIENDS.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.533
HERE WE DON'T HAVE FRIENDS.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.233
WE USED TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT IT
IS TOO FAR FROM HERE IN THE

06:11.233 --> 06:14.700
CAMP.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.633
DRR I'M AFRAID FOR MY DAUGHTERS.

06:16.633 --> 06:18.067
THEY WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

06:18.067 --> 06:20.667
THEY WANT TO STUDY BUT THE
SCHOOL IS FAR.

06:20.667 --> 06:25.000
>> Translator: ALL WE DO IS SIT
HOME ALL DAY.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.167
>> THESE ARE ORDINARY FAMILIES.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.733
FAMILIES THAT HAD WASHING
MACHINES, THAT HAD PICK-UP

06:30.733 --> 06:33.333
TRUCKS AND THEIR OWN KITCHEN AND
BATHROOM.

06:33.333 --> 06:37.000
AND NOW THEY'RE FACING WHO KNOWS
HOW LONG LIVING WITH THEIR

06:37.000 --> 06:38.033
FAMILIES IN A TENT.

06:38.033 --> 06:40.633
>> Reporter: THE CHALLENGES
FACING AID WORKERS MIGHT

06:40.633 --> 06:44.267
ACTUALLY GROW IF THERE'S A
MILITARY ATTACK AGAINST SYRIA.

06:44.267 --> 06:50.033
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEIR MAKING
CONTINGENCY PLANS TO HOUSE AN

06:50.033 --> 06:54.633
ADDITIONAL 150,000 SYRIANS WHO
MIGHT FLEE INTO JORDAN, THAT

06:54.633 --> 06:57.500
COULD MEAN MORE DIVIDED
FAMILIES.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.067
FOR NOW, HER ONLY CONNECTION TO
HER HUSBAND IS THE PHONE.

07:00.067 --> 07:00.800
>> Translator: HELLO, PEACE TO
YOU.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.500
HOW ARE YOU?

07:02.500 --> 07:06.367
HOW IS THE VILLAGE TODAY?

07:06.367 --> 07:09.867
THE BOMBING IS STILL GOING ON?

07:09.867 --> 07:12.800
GOD HELP US, SWEETHEART.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.533
>>> TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIANS
HAVE ALSO FLED TO EGYPT.

07:16.533 --> 07:19.233
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT AND FOR THE
LATEST DIPLOMATIC MANEUVERING IN

07:19.233 --> 07:23.800
THE ARAB WORLD, WE'RE JOINED NOW
FROM CAIRO BY "THE NEWSHOUR'S"

07:23.800 --> 07:25.733
MARGARET WARNER.

07:25.733 --> 07:28.500
HOW MANY SYRIANS HAVE TAKEN
REFUGE IN EGYPT AND ARE THEY

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
BEING WELCOMED THERE?

07:30.500 --> 07:33.100
>> Reporter: HARI, THERE ARE
MORE THAN 100,000 SYRIAN

07:33.100 --> 07:35.100
REFUGEES HERE.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.433
IN A COUNTRY OF MORE THAN 80
MILLION, DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

07:36.433 --> 07:38.700
MUCH.

07:38.700 --> 07:42.567
BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY CONCENTRATED
IN THE CITIES HERE IN CAIRO AND

07:42.567 --> 07:45.400
ALEXANDRIA AND THEY'RE NOT BEING
TERRIBLY WELCOMED.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.467
I'VE HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM
EGYPTIANS SAYING YOU SEE THEM ON

07:49.467 --> 07:52.933
EVERY CORNER BEGGING.

07:52.933 --> 07:58.267
SINCE MORSI WAS OUSTED, POLICE
AND MILITARY HAVE BEEN ROUNDING

07:58.267 --> 08:02.300
UP SYRIAN MEN AND BOYS, PUTTING
THEM IN DETENTION ACCUSING THEM

08:02.300 --> 08:06.967
OF BEING MORSI SUPPORTERS OR
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUPPORTERS.

08:06.967 --> 08:10.700
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SOME
OF THE SYRIAN REFUGEES FEEL SO

08:10.700 --> 08:13.800
UNWELCOMED AND THREATENED THAT
THEY'RE PAYING SMUGGLERS TO TRY

08:13.800 --> 08:15.100
TO GET THEM INTO EUROPE.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.433
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT A BIGGER
PICTURE.

08:18.433 --> 08:21.367
JUNE 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA COMES
TO THE CITY THAT YOU'RE STANDING

08:21.367 --> 08:25.000
IN NOW, TRIES TO RESET RELATIONS
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH THAT BIG

08:25.000 --> 08:27.067
SPEECH, THE NEW BEGINNING.

08:27.067 --> 08:30.567
WITH THE REPORTING YOU'VE DONE
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ON THIS

08:30.567 --> 08:32.867
TRIP, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT
HOW MUCH SUPPORT ARAB

08:32.867 --> 08:34.100
GOVERNMENTS ARE WILLING TO GIVE
THE UNITED STATES ON A POSSIBLE

08:34.100 --> 08:36.300
STRIKE IN SYRIA?

08:36.300 --> 08:40.367
>> Reporter: WELL, ONE THING'S
FOR SURE, HARI.

08:40.367 --> 08:43.900
THERE WILL NOT BE A UNIFIED ARAB
SUPPORT FOR STRIKE HERE AS THERE

08:43.900 --> 08:46.367
WAS, VIS-A-VIS, LIBYA.

08:46.367 --> 08:49.100
YOU HAD THE ARAB LEAGUE MEETING
HERE EARLIER THIS WEEK.

08:49.100 --> 08:53.133
THOSE MEMBERS DID ENDORSE THE
IDEA, THE ACCUSATION THAT BASHAR

08:53.133 --> 08:57.067
AL ASSAD WAS BEHIND THAT AUGUST
21st CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

08:57.067 --> 09:02.567
THEY REFUSED TO ENDORSE THE
MILITARY STRIKE AND AT THE G-20

09:02.567 --> 09:03.900
MEETING THAT JUST ENDED IN ST.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.600
PETERSBURG, ONLY TWO OF THE
MUSLIM COUNTRIES, MAJORITY

09:06.600 --> 09:11.033
MUSLIM COUNTRIES THERE, SAUDI
ARABIA AND TURKEY, SIGNED ONTO

09:11.033 --> 09:14.433
THIS STATEMENT THAT CALLED FOR
SOME SORTOVER, QUOTE,

09:14.433 --> 09:18.400
ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROHIBITION
AGAINST CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.300
SECRETARY KERRY DISCUSSED IN HIS
TESTIMONY THIS WEEK THAT THERE

09:21.300 --> 09:22.533
MIGHT BE SOME FINANCIAL SUPPORT
FROM ARAB COUNTRIES FOR SUCH AN

09:22.533 --> 09:25.500
OPERATION.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.433
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING HAS BEEN
MATERIALIZED PUBLICLY ABOUT

09:28.433 --> 09:28.033
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE EGYPTIAN
STREETS, SO TO SPEAK?

09:28.033 --> 09:33.400
THAT.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.300
I KNOW THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE
OUT BECAUSE THE CURFEWS HAVE

09:37.300 --> 09:38.233
BEEN EASED.

09:38.233 --> 09:41.967
BUT WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT A
POSSIBLE MILITARY STRIKE BY THE

09:41.967 --> 09:42.567
UNITED STATES?

09:42.567 --> 09:44.067
DO THEY SUPPORT IT?

09:44.067 --> 09:45.433
>> Reporter: I HAVE TALKED TO
DOZENS OF EGYPTIANS IN THIS PAST

09:45.433 --> 09:50.167
WEEK.

09:50.167 --> 09:54.633
I HAVE NOT MET ONE THAT SUPPORTS
A STRIKE AGAINST SYRIA, DESPITE

09:54.633 --> 09:56.100
THEIR COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE WHO
ARE GASSED IN THE CHEMICAL

09:56.100 --> 09:58.900
WEAPONS ATTACK.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.633
THEY TALK ABOUT IRAQ, THAT THE
U.S. INTELLIGENCE IS FALL SI.

10:01.633 --> 10:06.867
AND THAT IRAQ HAS DESCENDED BACK
INTO SECTARIAN STRIFE AND IS

10:06.867 --> 10:08.200
EXPORTING JIHADI TERRORISTS TO
SYRIA AND SOME MAY FEAR TO

10:08.200 --> 10:10.000
EGYPT.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.600
THE OTHER THING, HARI, IS THAT
THIS IS EXACERBATED HERE BY THE

10:17.600 --> 10:20.767
STRONGEST ANTI-AMERICANISM I
HAVE EVER FELT.

10:20.767 --> 10:27.000
THE PRO-MILITARY OUSTER OF MORSI
CAMP FEELS STRONGLY THAT IF THE

10:27.000 --> 10:30.433
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CODDLES
PRESIDENT MORSI AS HE BECAME

10:30.433 --> 10:35.433
MORE AND MORE AUTOCATIC, MORSI
SUPPORTERS, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD

10:35.433 --> 10:41.567
SUPPORTERS WENT TO A RALLY AND
ANGRILY SAID TO ME, WHY WON'T

10:41.567 --> 10:43.500
YOUR PRESIDENT CALL WHAT
HAPPENED A COUP?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.767
IT'S COMING FROM BOTH SIDES.

10:45.767 --> 10:48.067
AND THAT'S MADE ITSELF FELT ON
US.

10:48.067 --> 10:51.033
WE'VE BEEN THROWN OUT OF
RESTAURANTS.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.767
WE'VE HAD OUR LOCAL PRODUCER
CALLED A TRAITOR TO EGYPT FOR

10:53.767 --> 10:56.633
WORKING WITH US.

10:56.633 --> 11:03.433
SO THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A
FEELING OF CONNECTION BETWEEN

11:03.433 --> 11:06.733
THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN AND REALLY
ANYTHING AMERICANS DO.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.200
>> WHILE THE WORLD'S BEEN
FOCUSED ON SYRIA, THE SITUATION

11:10.200 --> 11:12.800
IN EGYPTIAN SEEMS TO BE
DETERIORATING.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.333
>> Reporter: IT IS DETERIORATING
IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS

11:16.333 --> 11:18.433
BECOMING A VERY DIVIDED SOCIETY.

11:18.433 --> 11:23.000
WHEN WE WERE JUST FIRST DURING
THE REVOLUTION 2 1/2 YEARS AGO,

11:23.000 --> 11:28.200
SECULARS AND ISLAMISTS ALIKE
WERE UNITED.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.767
EVEN LATER THAT YEAR, THERE WAS
GREAT UNHAPPINESS WITH MILITARY

11:31.767 --> 11:34.633
RECALL BUT STILL THOSE TWO CAMPS
WERE UNITED.

11:34.633 --> 11:36.833
NOW YOU HAVE DEEP POLARIZATION
BETWEEN THE TWO.

11:36.833 --> 11:40.133
EACH SIDE BRANDING THE OTHER.

SHE SAID, IF YOU'RE IN THE OTHER
GROUP, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

11:53.233 --> 11:56.067
SO THIS IS -- WHO KNOWS WHERE
IT'S GOING?

11:56.067 --> 11:59.600

TO BRING ABOUT SOME SORT OF A

11:59.600 --> 12:02.400

DEMOCRACY BACK HERE.

NOT JUST MILITARILY.

ISRAEL'S ECONOMY MAY BE ABOUT TO

DISCOVERIES THAT HAVE IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGION.

"NEWSHOUR" CORRESPONDENT MARTIN
FLETCHER REPORTS.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.433

HERE IN ISRAEL.

15:15.433 --> 15:19.600
MOSES LEAD THE JEWS THROUGH THE
ONLY PLACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

15:19.600 --> 15:22.633
WITH NO OIL AND NO GAS.

15:22.633 --> 15:25.300
SO ISRAEL'S BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY
DEPENDENT ON FUEL IMPORTS FOR

15:25.300 --> 15:27.567
ENERGY.

15:27.567 --> 15:31.433
COSTLY AND PRECARIOUS, A NATION
SURROUNDED BY OFTEN HOSTILE

15:31.433 --> 15:33.100

15:33.100 --> 15:36.233
BUT NOW THAT'S ALL CHANGING.

15:36.233 --> 15:41.300
ISRAEL HAS AT LAST DISCOVERED SO
MUCH NATURAL GAS, IT'S HEADING

15:41.300 --> 15:42.633
TOWARDS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, A
GAS EXPORTER IN JUST A FEW

15:42.633 --> 15:45.333
YEARS.

56 MILES AFTER ISRAEL'S
MEDITERRANEAN COAST, THE TAMAR

EARLIER THIS YEAR WITH ENOUGH

15:53.033 --> 15:55.833
GAS TO SUPPLY ISRAEL FOR
DECADES, ANOTHER FIELD NEARBY

15:55.833 --> 15:59.567
ALMOST TWICE AS BIG SHOULD BE
PUMPING IN THREE TO FOUR YEARS.

15:59.567 --> 16:04.433
ISRAEL BELIEVES BOTH FIELDS LIE
WELL WITHIN ITS MARITIME BORDERS

16:04.433 --> 16:07.400
THOUGH THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT
HAS CHALLENGED THAT.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.533
THE STAKES ARE HIGH BECAUSE
THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS OF HUGE

16:10.533 --> 16:13.867
OIL DEPOSITS NEAR THE VERY SAME
GAS FIELDS.

16:13.867 --> 16:16.933
SOME CALL THESE NEW DISCOVERIES
AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.367

16:38.267 --> 16:41.800
WE NEEDED THE RESOURCES TO BE

16:41.800 --> 16:45.100
BUT I THINK THE UNIQUE
CONTRIBUTION THAT WE WERE ABLE

16:45.100 --> 16:49.700
TO BRING IS THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND
THE BELIEF.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.600

HE HAD A HUNCH THERE WAS GAS IN
ISRAELI WATERS BECAUSE EGYPT

16:59.100 --> 17:00.800
FOUND SOME NEARBY, AND HE SOUGHT
INVESTMENT FROM THE TEXAS OIL

17:00.800 --> 17:03.000

BIGGER CUSTOMERS, THE ARABS.

TO THE TAMAR PLATFORM IN MARCH

17:35.867 --> 17:38.967
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO GENERATE
MOST OF ISRAEL'S ENERGY INSTEAD

17:38.967 --> 17:44.033
OF RELYING ON COSTLY IMPORTS OF
COAL, DIESEL AND HEAVY FUEL OIL.

FUEL SAVINGS.

CONSIDERABLE ENGINEERING TO GET

17:57.100 --> 17:59.533
AT THE GAS.

17:59.533 --> 18:04.000
FIVE WELLS WERE DRILLED, SOME
MORE THAN THREE MILES BELOW THE

18:04.000 --> 18:07.167
SEABED, IN WATERS TOO DEEP FOR A
PRODUCTION PLATFORM.

18:07.167 --> 18:12.567
SO PIPES WERE LAID TO SHALLOWER
WATERS MORE THAN 90 MILES AWAY.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.633
THE LONGEST IN THE WORLD.

18:14.633 --> 18:19.000
THE PLATFORM AND BASE WERE BUILT
IN TEXAS AND TRANSPORTED MORE

18:19.000 --> 18:21.167
THAN 8,000 MILES TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN, WHERE THE BASE

18:21.167 --> 18:24.167
WAS PLUNGED INTO THE SEA AND THE
PLATFORM PLACED ON TOP.

18:24.167 --> 18:28.467
FROM CONCEPTION TO OPERATION,
JUST OVER FOUR YEARS.

18:28.467 --> 18:32.067

FILTERED AGAIN AND FED TO

18:46.300 --> 18:51.700
GAS.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.100
MULTIPLE POWER STATIONS WHICH
CONVERT IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO

18:54.100 --> 18:55.667
FEED ISRAEL'S ELECTRIC GRID.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.700
IT'S ALREADY HELPING THE
ENVIRONMENT.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.800
TODAY, 40% OF ISRAEL'S
ELECTRICITY IS FUELED BY GAS.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.500
IT'S MUCH CHEAPER AND MUCH
CLEANER THAN OIL.

19:04.500 --> 19:10.967
>> WE'VE SAVED THE COUNTRY 17
MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO2

19:10.967 --> 19:10.700
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING
ALL THE CARS IN ISRAEL OFF THE

BENEFIT, A HUGE BOOST TO

19:18.767 --> 19:21.267
ISRAEL'S ECONOMY.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.667
GAS WILL ADD 1% TO ISRAEL'S GDP
THIS YEAR.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.033
THAT'S TRIGGERED A DEBATE HERE.

19:26.033 --> 19:29.200
WHAT WILL ISRAEL DO WITH ITS
FINANCIAL WINDFALL.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.800
THE KEY QUESTION?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.467
WILL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE MAKE
ISRAEL STRONGER AND HOW?

19:33.467 --> 19:37.333
IT'S A RED HOT TOPIC IN THE
COUNTRY THAT ALREADY SPENDS 20%

19:37.333 --> 19:40.900
OF ITS BUDGET ON DEFENSE, FAR
MORE THAN OTHER WESTERN NATIONS.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.500
CRITICS WORRY THAT PROTECTING
THE NEW PLATFORMS, SITTING DUCKS

19:44.500 --> 19:47.233
AT SEA, WILL MEAN EVEN MORE
MONEY IS DIVERTED FROM DOMESTIC

19:47.233 --> 19:48.267
SPENDING TO DEFENSE.

19:48.267 --> 19:52.367
AND THEY SAY THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.633
THERE HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN
PROTESTS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S

19:54.633 --> 19:56.900
PLAN TO EXPORT MUCH OF THE GAS.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.300
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS WILL
GENERATE BILLIONS IN NEW

19:58.300 --> 20:00.233
REVENUES.

20:00.233 --> 20:05.467
BUT CRITICS SAY THE GOVERNMENT
ACTED WITHOUT NECESSARY

20:05.467 --> 20:10.000
PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL AND ARE
CHALLENGING THE PLAN IN COURT.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.133
LAWMAKERS LIKE THIS ONE SAY MORE
GAS SHOULD BE KEPT AT HOME AND

20:13.133 --> 20:16.367
MORE OF THE GAS REVENUES
INVESTED IN DOMESTIC PROGRAMS

20:16.367 --> 20:18.300
OTHER THAN DEFENSE.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.900
>> THERE IS AN ECONOMIC AND A
SOCIAL THREAT.

20:20.900 --> 20:24.000
AND POVERTY IS A BIGGER THREAT
THAN SECURITY RIGHT NOW TO

20:24.000 --> 20:25.967
ISRAEL.

20:25.967 --> 20:31.467
THE PRICES ARE GOING UP,
SALARIES ARE GOING DOWN AND

20:31.467 --> 20:34.900
SOCIAL SERVICES LIKE, FOR
EXAMPLE, HOUSING ARE BEING

20:34.900 --> 20:37.033
NEGLECTED.

20:37.033 --> 20:41.167
WE SHOULD BUILD A MORE VIABLE
AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY.

20:41.167 --> 20:43.967
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE
NATURAL GAS CAN TRULY HELP DOING

20:43.967 --> 20:44.967

ASPECT TO THIS STORY.

HOW WILL ISRAEL'S GAS FIND
AFFECT THE ALWAYS VOLATILE

20:51.167 --> 20:52.000
POLITICS OF THE REGION?

20:52.000 --> 20:56.067
THAT'S A CONCERN BECAUSE THE GAS
SPACE IS BELIEVED TO EXTEND INTO

20:56.067 --> 20:59.867

BOTH TECHNICALLY AT WAR WITH

20:59.867 --> 20:59.633

CONFLICT, AT LEAST DIPLOMATIC,

OVER WHO GETS TO DEVELOP THE
WEALTH OF THAT AREA.

21:29.900 --> 21:34.067

EXPORTS INTO THE PALESTINIAN

THAT WILL INTENSIFY THE

21:42.500 --> 21:44.167
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE
PARTIES.

21:44.167 --> 21:47.200
AND YOU'LL SEE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT
NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIPS.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.333
FOR EXAMPLE, WILL ISRAEL BE ABLE
TO STRIKE UP TRADE ARRANGEMENTS

21:51.333 --> 21:52.867

CHILDREN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

22:42.433 --> 22:46.167
