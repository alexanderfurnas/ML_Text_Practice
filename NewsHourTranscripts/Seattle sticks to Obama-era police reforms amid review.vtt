08:27.473 --> 08:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVE THAT SELF-DEFENSE WAS NOT

08:29.775 --> 08:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MOTIVATING FACTOR AND THAT THE

THE AVERAGE CITIZEN, AND THAT'S

09:00.239 --> 09:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
