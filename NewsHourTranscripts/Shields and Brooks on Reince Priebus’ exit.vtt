JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been another
head-turning week in Washington,
from the Republican failure

00:04.400 --> 00:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on health care, to the
president's surprising
statement on transgender
military members,

00:11.766 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a flurry of profanity
from the new White
House communications
director and then, to

00:16.500 --> 00:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cap it off, today's announcement
from Mr. Trump that he is
changing his chief of staff.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here to help make sense of
it all, Shields and Brooks.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:25.433 --> 00:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I thought we had a lot of
things to talk about, David,
before about an hour ago, when

00:29.666 --> 00:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we learned that the president
was changing his chief of staff.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this -- I guess we knew
that this might happen.

00:37.033 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus has been in
trouble with this president,
we think, for a while, but what

00:41.733 --> 00:43.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you think?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he was never
given the chance to do the job.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every other chief of staff
we have ever seen sort
of controls the schedule.

00:48.533 --> 00:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They control the tempo
in the White House.

00:49.766 --> 00:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the alter
ego of the president.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are given some clear
sign of respect that they
speak for the president.

00:54.866 --> 00:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Priebus never had that.

00:56.933 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so he was wounded
and stabbed before
Scaramucci came along.

01:01.533 --> 01:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was stabbed like a pinata.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he was sort of a pathetic
figure hanging out there.

01:06.666 --> 01:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this doesn't come
as a total surprise, except
for maybe the timing.

01:10.266 --> 01:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for General Kelly
taking the job, I sort of
question his sanity there.

01:14.500 --> 01:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been a loyalist, but I
really -- with all due respect
to the Marine Corps, I don't

01:21.433 --> 01:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how someone who's been
trained in pretty orderly chain
of command is going to survive

01:24.400 --> 01:25.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this mess.

01:25.866 --> 01:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he can control the
schedule, it will be one thing.

01:27.933 --> 01:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't think that's
going to happen, given all the
independent power figures all

01:32.733 --> 01:34.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around him.

01:34.266 --> 01:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you make
of it, Priebus out and Kelly in?

01:36.266 --> 01:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I am
continually amazed that it's not
simply a matter of human decency

01:44.933 --> 01:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or empathy when your boss is
firing anybody to make sure
that that person leaves and has

01:52.466 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a soft landing, that
they can leave with their
self-respect, that they
can leave with someplace

01:56.966 --> 02:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go to, with a plausible
explanation to their family
and friends that they weren't

02:02.833 --> 02:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
humiliated, abused and derided.

02:05.266 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This president treats staff
and others like a used sickness
bag on a bad airplane flight.

02:12.366 --> 02:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just absolutely no sense
of respect or decency shown,
so you humiliate somebody.

02:19.633 --> 02:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for those who are
left, there is just a
sense of, could I be next?

02:24.566 --> 02:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It certainly doesn't
inspire loyalty.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As far as Kelly is
concerned, General Kelly
is a four-star general.

02:30.266 --> 02:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think David
put his finger on it.

02:31.966 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had a very distinguished
and honorable military career.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he grew up in a
military structure.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He thrived up in a
military structure.

02:38.833 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As a chief of staff at
the White House, this is
a freelancing operation.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no chain of command.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are all sorts of
people who go in and see
the president any time,
who are not accountable

02:50.233 --> 02:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to you or responsible.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And least of all, you have
a president who will even --
won't abide by any sense of a

02:56.833 --> 03:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chain of command or structure.

03:00.100 --> 03:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know that General
Kelly has any particular
political gifts or knowledge of

03:06.466 --> 03:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the legislative process or
dealings with the press.

03:09.100 --> 03:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not -- I know that
the president admires
him and the job he's
done at Homeland Security

03:15.300 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and his career, but
I don't see the fit.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we should
say that Reince Priebus, just
in the last few minutes, David,

03:20.866 --> 03:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put out a statement saying
it's been one of the greatest
honors of his life to serve this

03:25.333 --> 03:26.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I guess that's what
one expects, maybe.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Gracious.

03:28.866 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure he would
pass a lie-detector test.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:32.700 --> 03:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But one of the
things that's happening here
is that the president is moving

03:36.033 --> 03:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
away from the Republican Party.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Priebus was a link to
the Republican Party.

03:39.966 --> 03:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The congressional
Republicans were -- had
some sort of relationship.

03:43.266 --> 03:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions was a key to
the link between congressional
Republicans and Donald Trump,

03:50.066 --> 03:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he's been under
assault in the most
humiliating way imaginable.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you're beginning to see
an administration - - I don't
know what party they're joining,

03:56.800 --> 03:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe the Bannon party, but
it's not the Republican Party.

03:59.766 --> 04:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you want to pass
legislation, you probably need
your allies on Capitol Hill.

04:04.566 --> 04:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to survive
investigative committees,
you probably want some
friends in your party.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this administration seems to
be moving the other direction.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, you
look at the White House, and
Vice President Mike Pence, Mark,

04:15.933 --> 04:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be the only person prominent
in the White House circle who
has any kind of Washington

04:22.333 --> 04:23.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Judy.

04:25.266 --> 04:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And presidents thrive,
ideally, when they're both
loved and feared politically.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is neither.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Nobody loves him
on Capitol Hill.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he shows loyalty
is a one-way street.

04:38.033 --> 04:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not somebody who has
personal relationships
of any standing.

04:45.033 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the loyalty or disloyalty
that he shows to his people,
including Jeff Sessions, the

04:51.966 --> 04:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general, who was just
humiliated, someone who was
with him early and strong,

04:57.533 --> 05:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a time when no other senator
stood up for him, and remained
there through all the "Access

05:01.233 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hollywood" and the how to molest
and harass and sexually bar
the women tapes and so forth.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there isn't that, Judy.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That doesn't exist.

05:12.066 --> 05:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And David's absolutely right.

05:14.233 --> 05:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you get in trouble, you
have got to have people who,
A, like you, believe in you and

05:20.666 --> 05:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are willing to go to some
political cost for you.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we saw that on
the health care.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump had about
as much influence on health care
as I had on the National League

05:28.133 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pennant race.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, which
leads us to another - - I mean,
David, you said they have had a

05:32.600 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggle anything passed,
getting legislation passed.

05:35.966 --> 05:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a flame-out for them.

05:38.233 --> 05:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, this
was a bigger thing than
Donald Trump, though.

05:41.366 --> 05:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was only one bill that lost.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was four bills that lost.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it wasn't only
a six-months effort.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a seven-year effort.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And you
could say you could go
back to Newt Gingrich.

05:51.566 --> 05:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of all the ways the
Republicans have tried to trim
entitlements like Medicaid or

05:54.366 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cut government.

05:55.633 --> 05:56.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Name a signal victory.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's not a victory.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They haven't been able
to trim one agency, cut
back one entitlement.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They failed every single time.

06:03.233 --> 06:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that suggests isn't
an electoral failure.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a failure of whether
Mitch McConnell had the right
strategy or not, though that

06:08.800 --> 06:10.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was lamentable.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a failure of trying to
take things away from people.

06:13.266 --> 06:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are under
assault from technology.

06:15.966 --> 06:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're under assault from a
breakdown in social fabric,
breakdown in families.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have got wage stagnations.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just don't want a party
to come in and say, we're going
to take more away from you.

06:24.466 --> 06:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Republicans have to wrap
their minds around the fact that
the American people basically

06:28.766 --> 06:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided that health care is
a right, and they figure,
we should get health care.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And our fellow countrymen
should get health care.

06:35.566 --> 06:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't mean you have to do
it the way the Democrats want
to do it with single-payer

06:38.733 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or whatever.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can do it with
market mechanisms.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have basically
got to wrap your mind
around universal coverage.

06:43.566 --> 06:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
see what happened here, Mark?

06:45.466 --> 06:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And where do you see it
going on health care?

06:47.433 --> 06:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, the yapping
dog, which was the Republican
Party, after chasing the

06:51.800 --> 06:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus for seven years,
caught it and had no idea
what to do with the bus.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All you needed is that
final vote that Lisa
described so well, and
that is the final argument,

07:04.633 --> 07:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after seven years, after winning
three national elections where
that is your organizing issue,

07:11.566 --> 07:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to repeal Obamacare,
came down to a single promise
and pledge to your fellow

07:14.900 --> 07:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans from the leadership,
and that is, what you are
voting for, we promise will

07:19.566 --> 07:21.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not become law.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, if you can
imagine anything, I mean,
that just said it all.

07:26.933 --> 07:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it was a
terrible performance.

07:29.300 --> 07:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House voted on something
without even a congressional
budget scoring of it.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Senate voted on something.

07:35.466 --> 07:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They didn't even have a
bill when they brought
it to the floor.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was no legislation.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I mean, it was horrendous.

07:40.866 --> 07:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was disappointing.

07:42.066 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were no ideas.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was no will.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was no imagination.

07:47.666 --> 07:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was
certainly no courage.

07:49.366 --> 07:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't blame Donald Trump, but
what was Donald Trump saying?

07:52.666 --> 07:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump was saying he's
disappointed in the attorney
general because he wasn't

07:56.300 --> 07:58.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loyal to him.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was his contribution to
the debate on health care as it
came to a vote in the Senate.

08:01.733 --> 08:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think the prospects are, David,
that they are going to be able

08:04.100 --> 08:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work with the Democrats, or
is that just something people
are saying that's never really

08:07.566 --> 08:09.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Going to happen?

08:09.066 --> 08:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think that
there is a potential there.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Republicans get to the
point we're going to expand
coverage, let's talk about

08:15.066 --> 08:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
how do it, I think you
could do some pretty
market-friendly reforms.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Bush did it with
the prescription drug bill
a number of years ago.

08:22.233 --> 08:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they're a long way
from that right now.

08:25.366 --> 08:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: John McCain
does deserve, in my
judgment, a shout-out.

08:32.300 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McCain's vote, flying back,
kept it alive, kept the debate
alive, allowing the motion

08:37.700 --> 08:39.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to proceed.

08:39.766 --> 08:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And John McCain applied the
-- he gave the speech once he
had the whole audience there

08:45.866 --> 08:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of senators, and he told them
what they had done wrong, that
they all stood accused, that

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their cheap partisanship
had replaced any kind
of sense of legislating.

08:55.966 --> 08:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really do think that
his vote -- we found out that
the testosterone level among

09:02.266 --> 09:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans was limited
essentially to two members
whose names were Lisa and Susan.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:09.133 --> 09:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And John
McCain joined that
want trio and showed, I
thought, real -- distinct

09:14.700 --> 09:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political courage, and
for the right reasons.

09:18.466 --> 09:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And some of the
Republican men in the House
of Representatives went after

09:21.466 --> 09:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those women, as
a matter of fact.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Blake
Farenthold, a courageous
Aaron Burr would-be.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:28.633 --> 09:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aaron Burr.

09:29.633 --> 09:30.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:30.866 --> 09:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It does
raise the question.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are watching this,
David, and they have to be
asking, is anything going to get

09:35.400 --> 09:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done in our nation's capital,
with the White House in
some measure of chaos?

09:42.900 --> 09:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there have been some
changes, but where's the
-- you know, what are
people to look forward

09:49.033 --> 09:50.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to now?

09:50.466 --> 09:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don't
think much is going to get done.

09:51.700 --> 09:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think they're
going to do tax reform.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tax reform is super hard.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's potentially as hard or
harder than health care reform.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it seems very unlikely
that that is going to get done.

10:00.733 --> 10:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what hasn't happened is,
you don't have people waking
up thinking, how creatively

10:07.700 --> 10:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can I come up with some
piece of legislation that
will do somebody some good?

10:12.800 --> 10:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I started covering
Congress in the 1980s, there
were a bunch of entrepreneurs.

10:16.666 --> 10:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jack Kemp was there.

10:18.066 --> 10:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bill Bradley would have
something on the gold standard.

10:20.066 --> 10:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a guy named
Jim Courter who always
had defense reform ideas.

10:23.633 --> 10:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you had start-ups in
the back rows of the House.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then they would
finagle their way
through the committees.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now you have very
few entrepreneurs.

10:31.466 --> 10:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have few people
thinking creatively.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I rarely get e-mail.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I rarely calls.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a guy named Ro
Khanna from San Francisco
or from Palo Alto who
is a Democrat who thinks

10:39.166 --> 10:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this way.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there is not as much
as entrepreneurship.

10:42.533 --> 10:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the main cause is because
the leadership of the body has
taken control and destroyed

10:48.066 --> 10:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
creativity throughout the ranks.

10:50.133 --> 10:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a fault of both
Nancy Pelosi probably and Mitch
McConnell, who just centralized

10:53.600 --> 10:55.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everything.

10:55.266 --> 10:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so the committee
system is broken and the
start-ups are broken.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
White House is having its
own share of problems.

11:00.833 --> 11:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have alluded to this, Mark,
a lot of attention this week
about this profanity-laced phone

11:07.900 --> 11:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation that the new White
House communications director --
he hasn't actually taken the job

11:14.666 --> 11:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet, but he's been named by
the president - - had with
a "New Yorker" reporter.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems that everywhere we
look, there is conflict, there
is screaming, there is discord.

11:24.966 --> 11:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, where do we see
hope and something positive?

11:30.266 --> 11:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, obviously
not in Shields and Brooks.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:33.300 --> 11:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm
giving you a chance.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:38.100 --> 11:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: "Mass
For Shut-Ins" is on, on
Sunday at 9:00, if people
want to hear a good

11:40.333 --> 11:42.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sermon.

11:42.233 --> 11:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, I would say this,
Judy, that Anthony
Scaramucci is Donald Trump.

11:48.766 --> 11:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every White House staff
to some degree inevitably
becomes a mirror reflection
of the candidate,

11:52.533 --> 11:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is it.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what he did, Donald Trump
approved of, the abusing of the
chief of staff, the abusing,

12:01.500 --> 12:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the denigration of
other leading members of
the White House staff.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, and did Donald
Trump disapprove?

12:07.600 --> 12:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you had a 14-year-old
daughter volunteering
on the Hill or a
14-year-old boy, I don't

12:14.000 --> 12:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care, and this is the
kind of language you get?

12:15.933 --> 12:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is blood-curdling.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's offensive and it's obscene.

12:19.766 --> 12:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You get
to defend him, David.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes,
it is offensable.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm from New York City.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark's from Boston.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on behalf of eight
million New Yorkers, I want to
apologize for our language.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scaramucci and Trump, I
just want to say that,
even though they're from
Queens and Long Island,

12:32.400 --> 12:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm pretty sure
they're Yankee fans.

12:33.633 --> 12:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not Mets fans.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:35.833 --> 12:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: We
don't talk that way.

12:36.766 --> 12:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, Mets fans.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No,
it's -- I agree.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Blood-curdling
would be the word.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I
gave you both a chance to
say something positive.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You didn't do it.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: You're
wonderful, Judy.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe we
will let you come back
and try again next week.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:47.800 --> 12:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thank you both.
