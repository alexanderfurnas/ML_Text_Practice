GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.241 --> 00:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: As
the Justice Department releases
a transcript

00:11.211 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Orlando shooter's 911
call, the Senate
takes up gun control, and the
Supreme Court

00:17.317 --> 00:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
upholds assault weapons bans in
two states.

00:20.554 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead, a
report on the
ground in Fallujah, where Iraqi
government

00:25.893 --> 00:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces are closing in on ISIS
militants holed
up in the key city.

00:30.831 --> 00:36.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, a big Trump
campaign staff
shakeup, as Democrats take a
summer lead in

00:36.503 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
polling and fund-raising. It's
Politics Monday.

00:39.473 --> 00:45.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the world's
most popular
modern art museum, London's Tate
Modern, builds

00:45.779 --> 00:49.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upon its pioneering history with
a new 10-story
wing.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SEROTA, Director, Tate
Modern: I
think that maybe we helped to
open up the

00:52.920 --> 00:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of what a museum could be,
that the experience
of visiting a museum should be a
learning

00:59.126 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience, but it should also
be a social
experience.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.399 --> 01:09.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.670 --> 01:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI today
released transcripts
of the 911 calls made by the
gunman in Orlando.

01:24.117 --> 01:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In them, Omar Mateen pledges
allegiance to
the leader of the Islamic State
group, and

01:29.389 --> 01:32.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says the U.S. should stop
bombing Iraq and
Syria.

01:32.993 --> 01:37.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Initially, this morning,
officials released
partial transcripts, without the
references

01:37.531 --> 01:39.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to ISIS.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONALD HOPPER, FBI Assistant
Special Agent
in Charge: Part of the redacting
is meant

01:41.401 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to not give credence to
individuals who have
done terrorist acts in the past.

01:45.472 --> 01:50.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to propagate
their rhetoric,
their violent rhetoric. And we
see no value

01:50.310 --> 01:53.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in putting those individuals'
names back out
there. We're trying to prevent
future acts

01:53.947 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from happening again. And for
cowards like
this one, people like that
influence them,

01:58.652 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so we're not going to continue
to put their
names out front.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans
criticized the
decision, and, hours later, the
Justice Department

02:05.826 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put out more complete
transcripts.

02:07.694 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the presidential
campaign,
Vice President Joe Biden went
after Donald

02:13.367 --> 02:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump today over his calls for
action against
Muslims.

02:16.937 --> 02:22.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Washington speech, the vice
president
didn't directly name the
Republican nominee-to-be,

02:22.609 --> 02:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but his target was clear.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: Wielding the politics of
fear and

02:26.980 --> 02:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intolerance, like the proposal
to ban Muslims
from entering the United States,
profiling

02:32.953 --> 02:40.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim Americans, slandering
entire religious
communities as complicit in
terrorism, calls

02:40.894 --> 02:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into question America's status
as the greatest
democracy in the history of the
world.

02:44.831 --> 02:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, Trump
fired his longtime
campaign manager, Corey
Lewandowski. The campaign

02:51.138 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave no reason, and Lewandowski
did not report
that he'd alienated members of
Trump's family.

02:57.310 --> 03:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asked on CNN why he was let go,
he said, "I
don't know the answer to that."
We will dig

03:02.049 --> 03:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deeper on Politics Monday.

03:03.950 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A searing heat
wave peaked
today in the Southwestern U.S.,
with temperatures

03:08.789 --> 03:15.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected to hit 120 degrees in
some places.
The triple digits are breaking
50-year-old

03:15.595 --> 03:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
records and at least two deaths
in Arizona
are blamed on the heat.
Conditions are also

03:20.534 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making it even tougher to
control wildfires
across the region.

03:24.671 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There will be no
federal criminal
charges in the case of a Georgia
teenager

03:29.543 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who suffocated inside a
rolled-up gym mat.
Kendrick Johnson died at his
Valdosta high

03:35.348 --> 03:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school in January 2013. Local
officials ruled
he got stuck trying to reach a
gym shoe. That

03:42.556 --> 03:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prompted rallies and marches,
but, today,
the Justice Department said
there's not enough

03:47.027 --> 03:49.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evidence to prove a crime.

03:49.062 --> 03:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The British
Parliament convened
in special session today to pay
tribute one

03:53.700 --> 03:59.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its own, Jo Cox. The Labor
Party member
was shot and stabbed to death
last week in

03:59.139 --> 04:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her home district. Lawmakers
recalled Cox's
life and work, and placed two
roses, one white

04:06.012 --> 04:11.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her home county of Yorkshire
and one red
for the Labor Party, at her
now-vacant seat.

04:11.651 --> 04:16.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL REEVES, Labor Party M.P.:
Jo was struck
down much too soon, so it now
falls on all

04:16.823 --> 04:22.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our shoulders, the woman I
met in the coffee
shop in Batley, Jo's friends,
M.P.s, all of

04:22.262 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, to carry on Jo's work, to
combat and guard
against hatred, intolerance, and
injustice,

04:29.002 --> 04:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to serve others with dignity and
with love.
And that is the best way that we
can remember

04:33.340 --> 04:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jo and all that she stood for.

04:35.809 --> 04:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After a three-day
halt, campaigning
resumed today on whether Britain
should stay

04:41.314 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the European Union. The
referendum will
be held Thursday.

04:44.818 --> 04:50.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street surged
today, on optimism
that Britain will vote to stay
in the E.U.

04:50.590 --> 04:58.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 129
points to close near 17805. The
Nasdaq rose

04:58.398 --> 05:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost 37 points, and the S&amp;P
500 added 12.

05:02.235 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A record 65
million people
were forced from their homes
worldwide last

05:07.874 --> 05:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, largely by war. That's
roughly equal
to the entire population of
Great Britain.

05:13.580 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N.'s refugee agency
reports more than
half were fleeing conflicts in
Syria, Afghanistan

05:19.686 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Somalia. And while millions
escaped to
other nations, many more are on
the run within

05:25.825 --> 05:27.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their own countries.

05:27.627 --> 05:32.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Iran says it has
broken up one
of the largest terror plots ever
on its soil.

05:32.432 --> 05:38.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State TV today reported police
arrested several
suspects and seized bombs and
ammunition.

05:38.438 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It suggested the Islamic State
or other Sunni
militants may be to blame. Iran
is supporting

05:44.177 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fight against ISIS in Iraq
and Syria.

05:46.947 --> 05:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And China leads
the world in
supercomputers for the seventh
year in a row.

05:52.652 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An annual ranking out today also
finds that,
for the first time, China has
more machines

05:58.391 --> 06:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the U.S. on the list. One
is five times
faster than the fastest U.S.
supercomputer.

06:05.799 --> 06:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the gun debate
continues in Congress and in
court; a humanitarian

06:12.038 --> 06:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis unveiled as Iraqi forces
retake Fallujah;
a major shakeup in the Donald
Trump campaign;

06:20.247 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

06:27.153 --> 06:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the wake of the
deadly Orlando
nightclub shooting, the debate
over gun violence

06:36.196 --> 06:39.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faced a series of votes on
Capitol Hill.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

06:41.234 --> 06:47.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: From
courtrooms, to Congress,
the often theoretical debate
over guns touched

06:47.540 --> 06:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground today, eight days after
the massacre
in Orlando.

06:52.212 --> 06:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, a showdown on the
Senate floor
over four different gun control
measures,

06:57.350 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from background checks to
banning sales to
those on the no-fly list. It was
a classic

07:02.589 --> 07:04.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
partisan duel.

07:04.491 --> 07:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MINORITY
LEADER: Republicans
say hey, look, we tried. And all
the time,

07:09.462 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're cheerleaders for bosses
at the NRA.

07:12.866 --> 07:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: Our
colleagues
want to make this about gun
control. My colleagues

07:19.306 --> 07:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many ways want to fight the
symptoms without
fighting the disease.

07:22.509 --> 07:27.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Lots of debate,
but no expected
changes, when all was said and
done.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the street, Supreme Court
justices
decided not to hear an appeal of
semiautomatic

07:32.118 --> 07:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons bans in Connecticut and
New York.
That means the bans stay in
place. They were

07:37.390 --> 07:42.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
enacted after the school
shooting in 2012,
at Newtown, Connecticut.

07:42.329 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Families of the Newtown victims
were also
watching this courtroom in
Bridgeport, where

07:47.033 --> 07:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a state judge heard arguments
about whether
they can sue a gun manufacturer.
James Vogts

07:51.905 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
represents Remington Arms, which
made the
semiautomatic rifle used in the
Newtown shooting.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES VOGTS, Remington Arms:
It's really not
the role of this court, or
perhaps a jury,

07:58.578 --> 08:07.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decide whether civilians, as
a class, broad
class of people, are not
appropriate to own

08:07.220 --> 08:09.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these class of firearms.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Joshua Koskoff
represents
the families who are suing.

08:12.592 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA KOSKOFF, Attorney For
Plaintiffs: It
was an AR-15 rifle, a weapon,
Judge, that

08:16.863 --> 08:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was designed to be used in
combat by our military
to assault and kill enemies of
war. It was

08:24.804 --> 08:30.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remington's choice to entrust
the most notorious
American military killing
machine to the public.

08:30.643 --> 08:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Recent polls
show Americans
generally support gun
restrictions. In a Reuters/Ipsos

08:35.582 --> 08:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survey last week, about 71
percent approved
of strong or moderate gun
restrictions, while

08:41.855 --> 08:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 16 percent want basic
limits and just
6 percent said firearms should
have no or

08:47.460 --> 08:49.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
few restrictions.

08:49.396 --> 08:54.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as debate continues, so
does the violence.
In Chicago yesterday, police
reported something

08:54.434 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rare, an apparent gang-related
shooting using
not a handgun, but a
semiautomatic assault

09:00.340 --> 09:01.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rifle.

09:02.008 --> 09:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When does it stop? What's
going to
-- how do we get help with this?
What do we

09:06.513 --> 09:07.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Chicago
victim was 17
years old.

09:10.450 --> 09:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
recurring debate
over gun laws and gun ownership,
we turn now

09:15.255 --> 09:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Marcia Coyle, "NewsHour"
regular and chief
Washington correspondent for
"The National

09:19.893 --> 09:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

appears in

09:24.564 --> 09:28.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this week's "New Yorker"
magazine, and, as
you just heard, "NewsHour"
correspondent Lisa

09:29.002 --> 09:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Desjardins, who's been following
the action
on Capitol Hill.

09:32.605 --> 09:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As of now, this time 6:00 p.m.
Eastern time
tonight, do we have any -- is
there any possibility

09:37.544 --> 09:40.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that any of the four gun bills
that were up
for a vote today might pass?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Realistically,
no. And we
already know that one has
failed, something

09:43.883 --> 09:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that seems innocuous, increasing
funding for
background checks on the federal
level. That

09:48.388 --> 09:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has not received 60 votes.

09:50.156 --> 09:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Republican amendment.
That didn't clear.
We do not expect the other three
to clear

09:54.727 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there that 60-vote bar either.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In spite of what we
just saw in
terms of public opinion?

09:58.832 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at public
opinion here,
there's a real disconnect. You
see overwhelmingly,

10:04.804 --> 10:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just Americans as a whole,
Gwen, supporting
things like background checks,
some moderate

10:09.542 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restrictions, you could say, but
Republicans
as a group.

10:12.879 --> 10:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, Pew and many other
groups have polled
Republicans and they find
80-some percent

10:17.650 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes support background
checks, but yet
Republicans on Capitol Hill are
going the

10:22.088 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exact opposite directions.

10:23.923 --> 10:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today at the Supreme
Court, Marcia,
we saw that the court decided
not to take

10:28.495 --> 10:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up a challenge to two assault
weapons bans
in New York and Connecticut.

10:32.832 --> 10:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we know that when the court
doesn't do
something, that doesn't
necessarily mean a

10:36.936 --> 10:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot. But there's a record here.
There's a
pattern.

10:39.272 --> 10:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well there is, the court not
wanting to get

10:43.176 --> 10:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back into this Second Amendment
arena.

10:46.179 --> 10:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court's had a number of
petitions come
before them in recent years.
Even this year,

10:52.552 --> 10:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was another assault
weapon-type ban
out of Highland Park, Illinois.
The challenge

10:59.792 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came there to the Supreme Court
and the Supreme
Court didn't want to take it

11:03.596 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up. It's not unusual for the
court to allow
certain questions to percolate
in the lower

11:10.169 --> 11:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts after it's made a major
ruling. And
the major ruling, though, here
came in 2008

11:15.542 --> 11:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the so-called Heller decision
involving
the District of Columbia's
handgun ban.

11:21.214 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're just -- you need
four votes to
take a case in the Supreme
Court, and they

11:25.585 --> 11:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just aren't there, despite some
rather strong
dissents from the denial of a
review by Justices

11:32.659 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito,
and the late
Antonin Scalia.

11:37.196 --> 11:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And those dissents
are about the
right to gun ownership, or what
are they?

11:42.335 --> 11:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: They're really
about how the
lower courts have been dealing
with applying

11:47.106 --> 11:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that 2008 landmark decision.

11:50.577 --> 11:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those three justices have said
at various
times that they feel the lower
courts aren't

11:54.847 --> 12:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving the right recognized by
the Second
Amendment the due that it should
have, and

12:00.987 --> 12:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are all over the map
in how they
examine restrictions on guns.
And it's time,

12:06.326 --> 12:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they feel, for the court to step
back into
this area.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, Evan, let's take
a step from
these two branches of government
and talk

12:13.733 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more specifically about the
business branch
of government, as it were.

12:17.704 --> 12:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a business incentive
which has very
little to do with the laws about
why guns

12:23.209 --> 12:25.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continue to be sold.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS, "The New Yorker":
Well, this is
the thing I think that is sort
of a paradox,

12:26.846 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is at this very moment when we
look at the
effects that guns has had on the
country in

12:30.683 --> 12:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last two weeks, the gun
business is actually
doing better than ever.

12:35.555 --> 12:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smith &amp; Wesson, the largest U.S.
gun manufacturer,
their stock price increased 10
percent by

12:41.361 --> 12:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time the market opened the
day after Orlando.
What's going on? The answer is
that the industry

12:46.265 --> 12:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occupies a very unique place in
American culture.
It's almost insulated from
business pressures

12:50.503 --> 12:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of a law that was passed
in Congress
in 2005, meaning that if
somebody wanted to

12:55.575 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring a lawsuit, they couldn't
do it now.

12:58.044 --> 13:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard to do it. One of
the things
we heard in the segment was
about this lawsuit

13:02.482 --> 13:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Connecticut, and that lawsuit
is enormously
important, because what it's
going to try

13:06.586 --> 13:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do is to figure out if the
gun industry
today, which has basically been
able to profit

13:12.392 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the period in which mass
shootings have
elevated the fear, have elevated
people's

13:16.029 --> 13:21.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
desire to own a gun for
self-defense, whether
in fact the kinds of civil cases
that have

13:21.701 --> 13:26.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the past have shaped
industry's behavior,
whether we're talking about BP,
for instance,

13:26.072 --> 13:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with oil, or whether we're
talking about tobacco
and how they market, whether in
fact they

13:29.976 --> 13:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be shaped by their role in
these kinds
of national tragedies.

13:34.347 --> 13:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lisa, just as we
have been talking,
a second effort at gun control
in the Senate

13:39.752 --> 13:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this afternoon has failed. Now,
here is my
question about that, though.

13:43.022 --> 13:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Evan just said, there's a
distinct difference
between an argument about gun
control and

13:48.327 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
self-defense. Self-defense seems
like something
everybody can get behind. Is
that the argument

13:53.399 --> 13:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is playing out on the floor
of the Senate
or is it something more arcane?

13:56.035 --> 13:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's both.

13:58.237 --> 14:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest argument to pay
attention to I
think for the endgame right now
is the argument

14:01.841 --> 14:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the no-fly or terror watch
list. And
I say this because, while
today's votes, we

14:05.912 --> 14:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do not expect to be meaningful,
there is a
compromise effort under way led
by Susan Collins

14:10.383 --> 14:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Maine just trying to pass
something.

14:12.552 --> 14:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen even Donald
Trump express
interest in somehow preventing
more people

14:17.056 --> 14:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the no-fly list from being
able to get
guns.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's something we
have heard
the president talk about too.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president, Democrats,
they all talk
sort of similar. But the
difference there

14:24.764 --> 14:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in is in the specifics. And it's
about Republicans'
mistrust of government having a
list of Americans

14:30.436 --> 14:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it can block from having a
gun.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The list is not public, you
don't know when
you're on the list, and
Republicans say that's

14:36.008 --> 14:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a problem. Now, they err on the
side of let's
not -- let's err on the side of
allowing more

14:41.681 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people the ability to buy guns.
Democrats
say no. Let's err on the side of
preventing

14:46.552 --> 14:49.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people who we think are
dangerous from having
guns. That's what they're
working out right

14:49.889 --> 14:51.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

14:51.691 --> 14:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, at the Supreme
Court or in
the courts in general, is there
a long line

14:56.195 --> 15:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of gun debates headed for the
high court or
does it pretty much stop at
appeals courts?

15:02.402 --> 15:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does it pretty much stop farther
down the
line, so the court waits for
conflict?

15:06.806 --> 15:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The court will
wait for a conflict.

15:09.976 --> 15:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they may get one involving
Maryland's
ban on assault weapons. That
right now is

15:15.314 --> 15:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals and
was argued in May, so a decision
could come

15:20.853 --> 15:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any day. But there's another
factor too, Gwen,
that I think comes into play
here. And that

15:27.393 --> 15:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, the New York case that the
Supreme Court
didn't take today wasn't the
major challenge.

15:34.834 --> 15:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal appellate court that
ruled in
the Connecticut case also had
the New York

15:39.739 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- another New York challenge at
the same
time and uphold New York's ban
back in October.

15:46.112 --> 15:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March, the largest gun rights
group in
New York decided not to go to
the Supreme

15:51.450 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court on the advice of their
lawyers, for
two reasons. One, Justice Scalia
was no longer

15:56.489 --> 16:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the bench, the champion of
the Second Amendment
individual right.

16:00.526 --> 16:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, two, we now have an
eight-justice court
and the possibility of a 4-4
split would mean

16:07.400 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the lower court's opinion
upholding both
bans would stand in place. And
they didn't

16:12.738 --> 16:14.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want that precedent set.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Fascinating.

16:16.075 --> 16:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Evan, in your piece in "The New
Yorker," you
talk about concealed-carry laws,
which, among

16:20.112 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other things, has driven up the
number of
guns that have been sold, as has
multiple

16:24.650 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun ownership. One person can
buy, can own
eight guns. And that's happening
more and

16:29.121 --> 16:29.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVAN OSNOS: Right.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the thing we don't often
talk about,
which is that the biggest change
that's gone

16:33.226 --> 16:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on in the culture of guns and
the business
of guns over the last generation
is that you

16:37.230 --> 16:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can now legally carry them in
all kinds of
places you simply couldn't
before.

16:41.667 --> 16:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two decades ago, you simply
couldn't leave
your house in many states, 22
states. It was

16:46.706 --> 16:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either illegal or restricted
regulated to
go outside with a gun. It's now
legal in all

16:50.743 --> 16:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 states. And this is really
the beginning,
I think, not the end, of a kind
of national

16:55.781 --> 17:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political conversation about
whether or not
we are ready for that, whether
or not people

17:00.486 --> 17:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accept that and where they
accept that.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the reasons I think why
the court has
been reluctant to weigh in to
what everybody

17:06.259 --> 17:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agrees is probably the next
great frontier
in Second Amendment law, which
is where can

17:11.864 --> 17:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you carry and why, is because
you see these
radical differences in place to
place.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far, what has happened is
that the
courts have basically said we're
going to

17:19.338 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leave it to these local
governments, state
governments and lower
governments to decide

17:23.476 --> 17:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who can carry a gun and why.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lisa, final thought?

17:26.345 --> 17:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And I think
here's why we
see the difference in politics
between the

17:28.147 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American landscape. We see, as a
percentage,
fewer gun owners, but they are
owning more

17:33.085 --> 17:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns. Just like we see in so
many issues,
it's becoming concentrated in
very vocal minorities,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they're controlling the
debate.

17:40.593 --> 17:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, Evan Osnos at
"The New Yorker"
and Marcia Coyle of "The
National Law Journal,"

17:45.665 --> 17:49.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you all very much.

17:49.168 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Pleasure.

17:52.571 --> 17:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: Thanks, Gwen.

17:57.143 --> 18:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to
Iraq.

18:01.047 --> 18:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The offensive to retake the city
of Fallujah,
held by ISIS for more than two
years, is proceeding

18:07.987 --> 18:13.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
much more quickly than
anticipated. But tens
of thousands of its residents
have been forced

18:13.893 --> 18:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the fighting into the desert,
as temperatures
soar, without services, or even
water in many

18:20.299 --> 18:22.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

18:22.134 --> 18:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to special correspondent
Jane Arraf.
She's in Baghdad now, where she
is on assignment

18:26.339 --> 18:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for The Christian Science
Monitor.

18:28.474 --> 18:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jane, you were just in Fallujah
yesterday.
And is it the case this
operation has been

18:34.480 --> 18:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going much faster than expected?

18:36.248 --> 18:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Well, Judy, it has
been going
faster certainly than some of
the previous

18:39.819 --> 18:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operations, including the battle
for the provincial
capital Anbar.

18:43.422 --> 18:49.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we have to remember
that Fallujah
is a different case. Fallujah
had up to 100,000

18:49.061 --> 18:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in it. And it was where
ISIS first
came into, where they tried to
persuade Iraqis

18:54.900 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that they were a better
alternative than the
Iraqi government.

18:57.870 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't lay the land mines,
they didn't
lay the improvised explosives
the same way

19:03.242 --> 19:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they riddled other cities
with. It was
actually faster for the special
forces that

19:08.347 --> 19:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were with to actually go
through there
and fight.

19:12.418 --> 19:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, they have not
in fact liberated
Fallujah, in the sense that the
Iraqi government

19:19.191 --> 19:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likes to say that they have.
Now, Iraqi special
forces, including the commander,
who we spoke

19:24.697 --> 19:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with, says that they have now
cleared 75 percent
of the city.

19:30.202 --> 19:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American military sources say
they think that's
closer to 25 percent. And they
say that the

19:35.608 --> 19:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort is continuing. But as
it's continuing,
as you pointed out, there is
absolute tragedy

19:41.814 --> 19:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the outskirts of Fallujah
with all these
civilians trying to flea.

19:45.818 --> 19:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, tell us
about that. Who
stayed in Fallujah when ISIS had
control,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what's happening to those
people?

19:54.360 --> 19:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: A lot of people did
leave at the
beginning, but then a lot of
people stayed

19:59.598 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a variety of reasons.

20:01.634 --> 20:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when it got to two years in,
essentially,
they weren't allowed to leave.
So, the people

20:06.939 --> 20:10.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I was speaking with, mostly
women and
children, because they were
separated from

20:10.276 --> 20:16.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their husbands and their
brothers as the Iraqi
security forces tried to weed
out suspected

20:16.048 --> 20:21.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS fighters from civilians
fleeing, were
telling us, were telling me that
they had

20:21.687 --> 20:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been without real food for weeks
on end.

20:25.891 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as the siege of Fallujah
intensified,
ISIS itself started running out
of food, and

20:32.198 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it started giving food only to
those tribes,
those families that were loyal
to it. So,

20:37.736 --> 20:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups of women who I spoke with
said that
they had been living on the only
thing they

20:41.373 --> 20:46.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
could afford, which was
basically dried dates
that were meant for animal feed.

20:46.278 --> 20:50.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They weren't allowed to leave
the city. If
they could leave the city, it
was through

20:50.249 --> 20:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bribery. And at this point,
people just don't
have the money. So, they
basically stayed,

20:55.221 --> 21:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, because they had to stay.
It is when
ISIS was driven back and the
floodgates opened

21:01.894 --> 21:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and up to 80,000 people fled
over the past
three days, just last week, that
things got

21:09.235 --> 21:10.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really dire.

21:11.003 --> 21:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people were actually killed
trying to
leave. I met a man with the
remainder of his

21:15.774 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family in an ambulance in
Fallujah being evacuated
by Iraqi security forces who has
lost three

21:22.047 --> 21:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his daughters and his wife.
As they were
leaving, they were hit by either
a mortar

21:27.119 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or a rocket.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ended up burying two of his
daughters in
the grounds in the hospital. And
then he couldn't

21:32.925 --> 21:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave until Iraqi security
forces rescued
him. There are other people who
drowned trying

21:37.329 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave.

21:39.098 --> 21:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even those who survive,
Judy, are living
in dire circumstances. There is
no water.

21:43.435 --> 21:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no consistent water
supply. There
is not even shelter. I have met
pregnant women

21:48.174 --> 21:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are lying on the ground
without even a
piece of shade.

21:51.377 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's doubly puzzling,
because this was
expected, this exodus of
civilians from Fallujah.

21:58.017 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying a
lot of people
are still there, but there's
just been little

22:02.922 --> 22:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or no provisions made for those
who have been
able to get out?

22:06.492 --> 22:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: There are very
people believed
left in the city.

22:10.296 --> 22:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, if you talk to aid
organizations, and
there are very few of them on
ground, that

22:14.200 --> 22:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the other problem, they will
tell you that
up to 80,000 people actually
fled over three

22:20.239 --> 22:22.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all of those people are in
areas surrounding
Fallujah. And it in places that
aren't really

22:26.045 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equipped to hold large numbers
of people.
The other problem is that they
are essentially

22:31.650 --> 22:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trapped between Fallujah and the
fighting
that is still going on there.

22:35.187 --> 22:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on this side, Baghdad.
Baghdad will not
let them in, because it believes
that many

22:40.826 --> 22:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them are ISIS supporters and
it isn't able
to screen them.

22:44.797 --> 22:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the most poignant scenes are
just across
a bridge that leads from the
outskirts of

22:49.501 --> 22:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baghdad to Anbar province. There
are thousands
of people, most of them women
and children,

22:54.907 --> 22:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
massed up against that bridge
waiting for
approval to cross. They're out
there in temperatures

22:59.545 --> 23:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are more than 100 degrees
in the shade.

23:01.914 --> 23:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're scrambling for even a
little bit of
water. There are no toilets.
There are no

23:05.818 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tents. And it is a sign really
that the international
community as well as the Iraqi
government

23:11.290 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has failed them. Everyone is
scrambling to
get aid in there, but at this
point there

23:16.095 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are people suffering, and
reports coming out
that some people may actually be
dying.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It sounds just
horrible.

23:22.801 --> 23:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jane Arraf reporting for us
right now in Baghdad
-- yesterday, you were in
Fallujah -- thank

23:30.909 --> 23:32.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

23:32.378 --> 23:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Thank you, Judy.

23:39.718 --> 23:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

23:43.522 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
hard times for
the coal industry and its
employees; Cleveland

23:49.428 --> 23:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
celebrates its first big sports
championship
in decades; and an inside look
at a major

23:55.601 --> 23:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addition to the world's most
popular museum
of modern art.

23:59.738 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, first, we turn
to today's
campaign news, and what the
summer solstice

24:04.977 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shakeup at the Trump campaign
reveals about
the candidate's strategy as he
heads into

24:10.382 --> 24:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the general election, while at
the same time,
Hillary Clinton launches a
pre-convention

24:15.154 --> 24:16.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending spree.

24:16.989 --> 24:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Politics Monday, and we
turn, as always,
to Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The

24:21.960 --> 24:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook Political Report, who joins
us tonight
from Pittsburgh.

24:25.764 --> 24:32.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tam, we know that Corey
Lewandowski, as Trump's
longtime right-hand man, who he
fiercely defended

24:32.938 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over cases that -- questions
that he roughed
up reporters, that he didn't
tell the truth,

24:37.710 --> 24:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he had continual fights
with other members
of the campaign, today, he's
out. What happened?

24:43.248 --> 24:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
it depends on who you ask.

24:46.785 --> 24:50.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Depending on which Trump
campaign source you
ask -- and my colleagues at NPR
have been

24:50.289 --> 24:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking many of them -- he was
either ousted,
fired or it was a mutually
agreed parting

24:57.062 --> 24:58.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the ways.

24:58.897 --> 25:05.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems quite clear that he was
in fact fired,
that the internal conflict, he
came out on

25:05.237 --> 25:09.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wrong side of the internal
conflict. And
the reality is, the Trump
campaign is in a

25:09.308 --> 25:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really weird place. He has been
the presumptive
nominee essentially for six
weeks, and he

25:16.782 --> 25:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't really used that time and
his campaign
hasn't used that time to gain
any sort of

25:22.054 --> 25:23.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an advantage.

25:23.889 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy, our friend Dana
Bash at CNN
interviewed Lewandowski at
length today, and

25:29.094 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said there was absolutely
nothing wrong,
in fact, that when Donald Trump
called him

25:32.831 --> 25:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said the words you're fired,
which reminds
us all of a certain reality
television show,

25:38.003 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he thought that was fine.

25:39.738 --> 25:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How unusual is it to have
shakeups like this,
and in big campaigns at this
stage?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: That's
an excellent question.

25:47.613 --> 25:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I went back and looked.
And so many
campaigns have had shakeups. The
most recent,

25:54.753 --> 26:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, in memory was the
John McCain shakeup.
He shook his campaign up both
before the primary

26:01.226 --> 26:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then over the summer of the
election year.

26:04.863 --> 26:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had -- I sent there and
looked. John
Kerry had a campaign shakeup.
Hillary Clinton

26:08.434 --> 26:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a campaign shakeup. John
Kerry, as I said,
had a campaign shakeup. There's
one thing

26:13.439 --> 26:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that all of them -- Al Gore as
well.

26:15.307 --> 26:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's one thing all of them
have one in
common. None of them won the
election for

26:20.179 --> 26:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president. None were elected
president of
the United States. Look, there
are two reasons

26:23.382 --> 26:28.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to go through a campaign
shakeup. Either,
one, you need to assure your
donors or activists

26:28.454 --> 26:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or insiders that things are
changing, because
they don't like the direction
that things

26:33.058 --> 26:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going, or, two, there's
actual -- something
going on in the campaign where
different advisers

26:38.630 --> 26:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the candidate have different
opinions
about where the campaign is
going to go.

26:42.067 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge it seems to me for
Donald Trump
and the Trump campaign is, it's
not so much

26:46.205 --> 26:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about strategy. It is the fact
that the candidate
himself doesn't seem to be able
to control

26:52.478 --> 26:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself. Donald Trump can't fire
himself.
And Donald Trump is the campaign
manager and

26:57.716 --> 27:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ad person and the pollster
and the policy
director.

27:01.987 --> 27:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is running this campaign.
And unless
or until he starts listening to
people who

27:06.959 --> 27:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are telling him to run a better,
more focused,
more disciplined campaign, I
don't think any

27:13.632 --> 27:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this is going to matter.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
conventional
measures we keep applying to
this campaign,

27:18.570 --> 27:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which isn't unreasonable, except
that he keeps
winning by unconventional
measures, and he

27:22.774 --> 27:25.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says that's how I'm going to win
the general
election.

27:25.310 --> 27:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about money. We
talked about donors
being a little freaked out.
Donald Trump is

27:29.281 --> 27:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually going places, and doing
fund-raisers,
and trying to raise money, he
says, for the

27:34.686 --> 27:36.388 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
party.

27:36.421 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But take a look at what he needs
to raise.
We have compared here what
Hillary Clinton

27:39.958 --> 27:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is apparently going to be
spending in the
next several months, or already
has started

27:43.428 --> 27:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending in key states, key
states that she
needs to win in the fall, $23
million on ads.

27:49.468 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is June. Let's compare to
how much Donald
Trump is spending.

27:53.105 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
Now, in Hillary
Clinton's case, we're talking
about super

27:57.476 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PACs, as well as her own
campaign money. But
how do you not spend any money
on ads?

28:04.182 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It seems that it
would be a
challenge.

28:07.286 --> 28:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's theory here is
that he can
do like he did in the primary,
dominate free

28:11.990 --> 28:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media. Cable will run his stump
speeches live
and he will just keep on having
big crowds

28:17.796 --> 28:19.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and keep on winning.

28:19.631 --> 28:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an interesting theory, but
it's not really
clear how well that's going to
hold up. In

28:24.536 --> 28:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2012, Mitt Romney ran ads in
June. He didn't
run nearly as much. He didn't
spend nearly

28:30.442 --> 28:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as President Obama and his
allies spent. He
was vastly outspent in June.

28:35.881 --> 28:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a result, the Obama
campaign and his
allies were really able to lock
in a narrative

28:41.653 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Mitt Romney was never able
to shake.
Well, Donald Trump has
essentially ceded the

28:46.191 --> 28:52.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
airwaves for this month.
Meanwhile, Hillary
Clinton's allies, Priorities
USA, her super

28:52.097 --> 28:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAC, has already booked more
than $100 million
in ad buys through November in
eight key states.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Wow.

29:00.572 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK. So, Amy, let's talk about
how one does
that. Another conventional
measure is having

29:05.077 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people who agree with you.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

29:07.813 --> 29:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So I saw a story in
The Texas
Tribune this weekend that Donald
Trump goes

29:09.915 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Texas to raise money and the
guy who introduces
him at the event, the Texas
banker, starts

29:15.187 --> 29:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to disagree with him on NAFTA,
starts to disagree
with him on immigration, and
this is a guy

29:19.458 --> 29:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
writing a check to the campaign.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, compare that
with Hillary
Clinton. Today, we saw Joe Biden
come out

29:24.963 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and speak and attack Trump on
her behalf.
We have seen Elizabeth Warren.

29:28.100 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a change, it's the Democrats
who appear
to be in lockstep and the
Republicans who

29:32.571 --> 29:33.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are not.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

29:35.040 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This idea about a unity party
has eluded Donald
Trump now for weeks. As Tam
pointed out, he

29:40.946 --> 29:46.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has had six weeks as the
presumptive nominee.
And every week, the story has
been about something

29:47.019 --> 29:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dysfunctional going on either
with Donald
Trump or the Donald Trump
campaign.

29:50.188 --> 29:53.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing I want to point
out about
this map that I think is really
interesting,

29:53.859 --> 29:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where both Hillary Clinton and
the super PAC
supporting her are spending
their money, they

29:58.530 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are all in swing states, yes,
indeed, but
these are offensive. This is an
offensive

30:02.968 --> 30:05.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strategy, rather than a
defensive strategy.

30:05.570 --> 30:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is not playing and the
outside group is
not playing ads in this state,
Pennsylvania,

30:11.943 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has long gone Democratic,
but a lot
of people see as the kind of
place where Donald

30:16.848 --> 30:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump can break through, or
Wisconsin, another
Rust Belt state, and of course
Michigan, another

30:21.386 --> 30:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state that Donald Trump says he
is going to
be able to compete in with his
appeal to white

30:24.990 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working-class voters.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that the campaign and
the super PAC
are not playing in those states
suggests to

30:30.962 --> 30:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me that they feel more confident
in their
defense and now they get to play
all offense

30:35.567 --> 30:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the time. Remember, if
Hillary Clinton
holds every single state that
John Kerry carried,

30:40.906 --> 30:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus Florida and New Mexico,
it's over. She
doesn't need to win any of those
other states

30:46.211 --> 30:48.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are in that map.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I have one more
question for both
of you. We only have a minute,
less than a

30:50.315 --> 30:52.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minute left.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there has been talk of a
delegate insurgency
in the Republican Party, people
who are going

30:55.520 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find a way to stop Trump at
the convention.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amy?

30:59.491 --> 31:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I'm beyond skeptical
that this
is going to happen. We have
heard this for

31:02.494 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a long time.

31:04.329 --> 31:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I have learned anything from
this primary,
it's that the insiders are not
driving this

31:07.265 --> 31:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
train. It's the grassroots. This
would go
over very badly with the
grassroots, with

31:11.570 --> 31:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the base, number one. Number
two, there is
no other candidate. I don't see
that there's

31:16.074 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an alternative.

31:17.909 --> 31:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, most important, do you
think that if
Trump gets ousted in a coup at
the convention,

31:21.213 --> 31:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is just going to go quietly
away and make
things easy for the Republicans?
He's going

31:25.417 --> 31:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be back on Twitter and back
on cable making
life miserable for them.

31:28.687 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Tam?

31:29.354 --> 31:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: What Amy said.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:30.589 --> 31:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She said it so well.

31:32.457 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I feel like this
bubble floats
up every four or five days, and
then it bursts

31:37.028 --> 31:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and comes back down, and then we
do it all
over again.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, big party in
Cleveland last
night. Maybe we will have
another upheaval

31:42.868 --> 31:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Cleveland this fall, this
summer.

31:45.070 --> 31:49.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara Keith of NPR, Amy Walker
of The Cook
Political Report, thank you, as
always.

31:49.808 --> 31:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

31:54.946 --> 32:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

32:00.085 --> 32:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hard times are
hitting the
energy sector in America's West.
Oil and gas

32:07.058 --> 32:12.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
production are down, and in
Wyoming's coal
industry, three of the state's
four largest

32:12.764 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
producers are now in bankruptcy,
leading to
hundreds of layoffs.

32:17.502 --> 32:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Public Media's Inside
Energy, Leigh Paterson
reports from Gillette, Wyoming,
on how the

32:23.508 --> 32:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state's energy booms and busts
are affecting
almost everyone.

32:28.480 --> 32:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Gail Japp's
horses have helped
her through hard times, like
when she was

32:34.686 --> 32:36.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting divorced.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL JAPP, Former Peabody Energy
Employee:
When you have had a bad day, you
just come

32:37.389 --> 32:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out and they just make life
worth going on.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Especially this
one, named
Money.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAIL JAPP: He's very trusting
and he's very
loving.

32:47.432 --> 32:52.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Recently, things
have been
tough again. Japp was one of the
nearly 500

32:52.637 --> 32:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wyoming coal miners laid off
recently. And
to pay her mortgage, she will
have to sell

32:56.741 --> 32:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of her things, including
her beloved
horses.

32:59.611 --> 33:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL JAPP: So, I have no choice.
I just -- I
have got to downsize. And
there's a lot of

33:07.452 --> 33:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stuff I'm going to have to sell.

33:09.354 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Japp worked for
Peabody Energy
for over a decade, mostly
massive haul trucks.

33:15.660 --> 33:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After cutting jobs, including
hers, in March,
the coal giant declared
bankruptcy in April.

33:20.732 --> 33:24.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAIL JAPP: Those were so fun.
Them things
were just awesome.

33:24.536 --> 33:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: She misses it,
and is worried
about getting a new job.

33:28.039 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL JAPP: Yes, I can't leave
Gillette, which
is really going to make it hard
for me to

33:32.010 --> 33:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find something, because my dad
is 90 years
old, and then I got two
grandkids here in

33:36.548 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town that try to stay with me as
much as they
can. So it's just -- I don't
know. It's been

33:44.823 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
devastating.

33:46.591 --> 33:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: That's because
prices for
coal, oil, and gas are all way
down, all at

33:52.297 --> 34:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same time. Revenue from
those industries
accounts for around 70 percent
of the state's

34:00.639 --> 34:02.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
budget.

34:02.607 --> 34:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fossil fuels employ around 10
percent of Wyoming's
private sector work force, so,
an energy bust

34:06.845 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hits towns like Gillette
particularly hard,
because this region is rich in
all three,

34:12.083 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coal, oil, and gas. Gillette
even calls itself
the energy capital of the
nation.

34:17.822 --> 34:22.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But over the past year,
unemployment claims
in the county have more than
doubled. Businesses

34:22.627 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are closing, homes are up for
sale, rail traffic
is way down, and people all of
the sudden

34:28.667 --> 34:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are in need of basics like food.

34:34.673 --> 34:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A line formed at this church-run
food bank
before the doors even opened.

34:38.977 --> 34:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Oh, well, this should
help out a little
bit.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

34:43.615 --> 34:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Volunteers
served 110 families
that day.

34:47.519 --> 34:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dennis Rehder is the pastor at
Project I:61
Ministries. After the layoffs at
the coal

34:53.925 --> 34:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mines, Rehder has been expecting
to see those
workers at the food bank. But he
says they

34:58.964 --> 35:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have actually been serving a lot
of people
in other industries, such as oil
field workers

35:03.401 --> 35:06.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and hotel employees who have
already been
out of work for months.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS REHDER, Project I:61
Ministries: What
that does, it creates us to be
aware that,

35:09.774 --> 35:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in three months from today,
those people that
are living off savings or they
have exhausted

35:15.413 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all their means of financial
help or other
community things, now they
really, really

35:21.286 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need it. So it's kind of like
we're a last
resort.

35:25.190 --> 35:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: People all over
the region
are looking ahead to try and
figure out what's

35:29.461 --> 35:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next, like many at this meeting
put on by
a coal advocacy group called
Friends of Coal.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN DOWNING, Executive
Director, Wyoming
Mining Association: I believe in
our great

35:37.802 --> 35:40.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state. And I know that, if
anybody can come
through this, its going to be
coal miners.

35:40.171 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: But that won't
be easy. For
decades, Gillette has had a
strong economy

35:44.275 --> 35:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a low unemployment rate,
fueled by energy
dollars and plentiful,
well-paying jobs.

35:49.714 --> 35:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The average coal miner in
Wyoming makes around
$83,000 a year. The average
American worker

35:55.920 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makes just over half that.

35:58.256 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stacey Moeller has been mining
since her 20s.
She says, for her, it's more
than just a job.

36:05.463 --> 36:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY MOELLER, Coal Miner: You
know, you
work at something for a long
time, and it

36:09.834 --> 36:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
becomes such a part of you.

36:11.736 --> 36:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Losing that
identity is scary.
And Moeller isn't sure anything
could replace

36:15.774 --> 36:17.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coal mining in Gillette.

36:17.642 --> 36:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY MOELLER: At this time,
you just can't.
There just isn't anything for
them to go to

36:23.048 --> 36:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's comparable. What would it
be? And how
do we start that? And how do we
get there?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

36:31.756 --> 36:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Everywhere you
go in Gillette,
people are thinking about these
kinds of questions,

36:37.062 --> 36:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Valerie Debeau and Barbi
Hays, the manager
and owner of a local BAR.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE DEBEAU, Jake's Tavern:
Jake's Tavern
is the working man's bar.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBI HAYS, Jake's Tavern: Its
like a neighborhood
bar.

36:45.737 --> 36:46.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VALERIE DEBEAU: It's a
neighborhood.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBI HAYS: It's like a Cheers,
yes.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Recently, they
have cut back
on hours and stopped offering
insurance to

36:52.977 --> 36:54.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their employees.

36:54.646 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE DEBEAU: We don't want to
have to lay
off anybody. So we just continue
on.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBI HAYS: Try to cut our
costs.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VALERIE DEBEAU: As much as we
can.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: Debeau and Hays
have seen
slowdowns before, having lived
in Gillette

37:07.158 --> 37:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for almost 40 years. So when I
asked what
they're hoping for, they went
back to what's

37:12.263 --> 37:13.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
always happened.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBI HAYS: Another boom. We
want that boom.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALERIE DEBEAU: Yes. Yes.

37:17.268 --> 37:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEIGH PATERSON: But another coal
boom is unlikely
anytime soon. Coal production
this year is

37:22.040 --> 37:27.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected to drop 16 percent,
which could mean
more trouble for towns like
Gillette all across

37:27.545 --> 37:28.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

37:28.947 --> 37:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Leigh Paterson
in Gillette, Wyoming.

37:38.256 --> 37:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It took more than 50
years of
sports misery, in baseball,
football and basketball,

37:51.536 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the city of Cleveland last
night to finally
break what even loyal fans had
come to believe

37:56.407 --> 37:58.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a curse.

37:58.143 --> 38:02.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But LeBron James and the
Cavaliers emerged
through last night, making
history with the

38:02.180 --> 38:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
greatest NBA championship series
comeback
ever.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has more.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's over! It's over!
Cleveland is a
city of champions once again!
The Cavaliers

38:09.053 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are NBA champions!

38:10.889 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Game seven of the NBA
Finals between
the Cleveland Cavaliers and the
Golden State

38:12.624 --> 38:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warriors was a tense affair from
start to
finish. Golden State led by as
much as eight

38:12.924 --> 38:14.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
points.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the second half, LeBron
James and guard
Kyrie Irving made huge plays on
both ends

38:16.628 --> 38:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the floor. And Cleveland
knocked off Golden
State, which had set a regular
season record

38:17.128 --> 38:18.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the most wins.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For James, whose jersey was
burned by fans
just six years ago when he left
for Miami,

38:20.265 --> 38:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his performance delivered on a
promise he
made upon his return.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEBRON JAMES, Cleveland
Cavaliers: I poured
my heart, my blood, my sweat, my
tears for

38:23.801 --> 38:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this game. And I'm home. This is
what I came
back for. This is unbelievable.
It doesn't

38:24.335 --> 38:26.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feel real right now.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A large span of
cheering crowds
turned out at the airport today
to welcome

38:27.071 --> 38:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the team home, a moment for Ohio
fans to savor.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we some perspective on
all of this
from Greg Swartz. Greg Swartz
writes about

38:30.875 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Cleveland Cavaliers for The
Bleacher Report.
He joins us from Toledo, Ohio.
And Kevin Blackistone

38:32.644 --> 38:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a sports writer for The
Washington Post.
He's also a regular contributor
at ESPN and

38:33.845 --> 38:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teaches sports journalism at the
University
of Maryland.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg, Kevin, thank you both for
joining us.

38:36.514 --> 38:37.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greg, let me start with you with
may be a
simple question, but how big a
deal is this

38:37.916 --> 38:39.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Cleveland?

38:39.817 --> 38:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG SWARTZ, Bleacher Report: I
think this
is a bigger deal than anybody
could have imagined.

38:43.988 --> 38:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at our history as a
sports community,
everybody knows it's been 52
years, but really,

38:51.062 --> 38:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Cavaliers, 46 seasons.
They have own
been to the NBA Finals -- this
is now the

38:56.968 --> 39:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
third time, obviously the first
time that
they have won it.

39:00.471 --> 39:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a big deal not just for
Cleveland,
but for Akron, for Northeast
Ohio, for all

39:05.143 --> 39:11.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ohio just to finally, finally
say, hey,
we got one, we're champions. It
is something

39:11.883 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that hasn't been done in a very
long time,
and it's a tremendous feeling
right now in

39:16.821 --> 39:18.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northern Ohio.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kevin, you have been
watching sports
and writing about sports for a
long time.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN BLACKISTONE, University of
Maryland:
Yes.

39:23.261 --> 39:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How many droughts are
there like
this? Compare this to previous
droughts? And

39:26.931 --> 39:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what droughts are left for big
sports cities?

39:29.701 --> 39:34.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Well,
obviously, you have
the Chicago Cubs. That's
probably the longest

39:34.739 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drought going. The Boston Red
Sox got over
their drought at the turn of the
millennium.

39:41.946 --> 39:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if you didn't have the
entire history
of Cleveland, just what LeBron
James was able

39:48.553 --> 39:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do transform the Cleveland
Cavaliers franchise
into a championship team, what
he's done there

39:55.860 --> 40:00.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just in the past two years since
arriving
is amazing in and of itself.

40:00.465 --> 40:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a huge deal, not
just in Cleveland,
but nationally. This is an
amazing sports

40:06.337 --> 40:08.106 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

40:08.139 --> 40:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Greg, Kevin just
talked about the
LeBron James departure and then
the return.

40:12.210 --> 40:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six years ago, he was the most
hated man in
Cleveland, I would imagine. Can
you have imagined

40:17.882 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back then this happening now?

40:20.451 --> 40:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG SWARTZ: No, no. I will
remember that
night forever in 2010, when he
made his decision.

40:29.727 --> 40:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was -- man, that was your
girlfriend
breaking up with you. That was
somebody stealing

40:36.234 --> 40:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your dog. That was every, like,
bad thing
that could happen to you, your
heart being

40:41.039 --> 40:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ripped out. And at that time,
nobody could
have thought he was going to
come back, just

40:46.778 --> 40:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four years later, still in his
prime, and
really did deliver a
championship here in

40:51.783 --> 40:53.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year two.

40:53.618 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's just phenomenal,
because you
look at it, his last two years
in Cleveland,

40:57.889 --> 41:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they won 66 and 60 games. The
four years that
he was gone, they had the worst
record in

41:04.128 --> 41:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the entire NBA. And now the two
years that
he's back, two finals trips, one
championship.

41:10.768 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can make the argument
he's still arguably
playing the best basketball of
his career

41:16.307 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after that finals performance.
So you're not
only happy about the present,
but you look

41:21.612 --> 41:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the next couple of years, and
they look
pretty good as well.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Kevin, let's
look at that.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years since he's back, he
takes them to
the title.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Right.

41:30.655 --> 41:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Takes them to the
championship
series twice, takes them to the
title.

41:34.258 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does this put LeBron James
now in the
game of basketball against
Michael Jordan,

41:40.064 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against all the others?

41:41.199 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Sure.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Magic Johnson tweeted out
last night
that it puts him in the category
of the top

41:45.403 --> 41:51.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five players all time in the
NBA. And I would
say that is absolutely the case.
Let's forget

41:51.676 --> 41:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fact that he led in
every category
in this finals, points,
rebounds, assists,

41:57.615 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steals, blocked shots, of all
the players
that were playing.

42:01.085 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's forget that two games
he scored
82 points games combined to
force this game

42:07.658 --> 42:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seven. But let's just look at
the fact that
he carried a rookie head coach
in Tyronn Lue

42:12.330 --> 42:14.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this championship.

42:14.132 --> 42:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A year ago, he took David Blatt,
another rookie
NBA head coach, to this
championship. When

42:19.971 --> 42:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was with Miami, he won
championships with
Erik Spoelstra as a head coach,
who, when

42:26.744 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he got there, had just been a
head coach for
a couple of years in this league
and was vastly

42:31.315 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unknown.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he was originally in
Cleveland, most
of the time, he was there, he
had Mike Brown,

42:36.287 --> 42:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who, when Mike Brown arrived
there, was a
rookie head coach in the NBA.
That's just

42:40.858 --> 42:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how dynamic it is a talent it is
that you
have in LeBron James, not only
as a player,

42:48.533 --> 42:50.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but also as a leader.

42:50.935 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're talking about someone
who has developed
these leadership skills despite
his upbringing,

42:57.008 --> 43:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming up in a single-parent
household, as
everyone knows the story,
socioeconomic problems,

43:03.948 --> 43:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shoving them here and there in
Akron where
he grew up. And he's such a
mature individual,

43:10.755 --> 43:17.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one of the most mature,
well-spoken, smartly
spoken athletes that we have in
pro sports

43:17.395 --> 43:19.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

43:19.263 --> 43:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Greg, you say
it's not just
Cleveland. It's the whole
region. Talk about

43:23.100 --> 43:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the region's attachment. And his
high school
games in Akron would be on ESPN.

43:29.507 --> 43:36.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREG SWARTZ: He is fully
immersed in the region.
I attended the University of
Akron. He was

43:36.380 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on campus all the time in the
summer. I would
go to the rec center. He would
be working

43:40.785 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out with his trainer. I would go
past the
James A. Rhodes Arena, he would
be in there

43:45.790 --> 43:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
playing pickup basketball with
Chris Paul.

43:47.825 --> 43:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would be sitting there
talking to some
of his buddies. And you just
would walk by

43:51.395 --> 43:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him on your way to class. He
doesn't just
talk about Akron and Cleveland
and profess

43:56.067 --> 44:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his love in words. He's there,
he's involved,
he's hands-on. He still lives
just right outside

44:03.774 --> 44:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Akron. He still loves the
community very,
very much.

44:08.312 --> 44:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Greg Swartz and Kevin
Blackistone,
thanks for being with us.

44:12.316 --> 44:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Thank you,
John.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG SWARTZ: Thank you.

44:21.926 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
a room with
a view, a very large view of
modern art. And

44:29.267 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it just got even bigger.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our report
from London.

44:33.704 --> 44:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Then Her Majesty saw
the adjoining
Bankside Power Station, which
supplies the

44:38.342 --> 44:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city and a large area of North
London.

44:41.312 --> 44:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: London, 1962,
Queen Elizabeth
II visits the Bankside Power
Station on the

44:47.151 --> 44:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
south bank of the River Thames.

44:49.954 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty-four years later, the
queen just celebrated
her 90th birthday. And the
former power station,

44:57.028 --> 45:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now better known as Tate Modern,
is celebrating
its remarkable transformation
into the world's

45:02.600 --> 45:08.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most visited modern art museum,
with the opening
of a new 10-story extension.

45:08.773 --> 45:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
London Mayor Sadiq Khan spoke at
the press
conference.

45:11.142 --> 45:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SADIQ KHAN, Mayor of London: The
Tate Modern
is such a success story. You
have continually

45:15.980 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found new ways of supporting
artists and reaching
new audiences.

45:20.585 --> 45:25.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Afterward, I
talked to Nicholas
Serota, the man who helped
conceive Tate Modern

45:25.523 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and has overseen it since it
opened in 2000.

45:27.925 --> 45:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SEROTA, Director, Tate
Modern: I
think that maybe we helped to
open up the

45:31.228 --> 45:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of what a museum could be,
that the experience
of visiting a museum should be a
learning

45:37.435 --> 45:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience. It should be a
personal aesthetic
experience ,but it should also
be a social

45:41.405 --> 45:43.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

45:43.274 --> 45:47.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: A social
experience in a free
public space. Tate Modern
quickly made itself

45:47.411 --> 45:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a game-changer for contemporary
art in Britain
and beyond.

45:51.015 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SEROTA: It meant a
place where you
could literally hang out and
meet people and

45:55.920 --> 46:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have conversations and debates
and discussions
and seminars and listen to
lectures and genuinely

46:03.127 --> 46:05.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
engage with the issues that
artists raise.

46:05.563 --> 46:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Works by modern
masters, from
Picasso to Warhol, were part of
the draw.

46:10.434 --> 46:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even more was the way the
repurposed power
station had been turned into
large inviting

46:15.339 --> 46:22.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gallery spaces, most of all the
35,000 square
foot Turbine Hall, the largest
gallery anyone

46:22.847 --> 46:24.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had ever seen.

46:24.615 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It became the site of enormous
exhibitions
by leading international
artists, including

46:29.353 --> 46:38.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anish Kapoor's Marsyas in 2002,
Olafur Eliasson's
Weather Project in 2004, Ai
Weiwei's Sunflowers

46:38.596 --> 46:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2010, and others that became
happenings
for locals and tourists alike. A
museum that

46:45.636 --> 46:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had expected to draw around two
million visitors
a year instead attracted more
than five.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Financial Times architecture
critic Edwin
Heathcote:

46:54.445 --> 47:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN HEATHCOTE, Financial
Times: Turbine
Hall is the best new public
space in an interior,

47:01.585 --> 47:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, possibly in the world.
We're used
to interiors now malls, huge
hotel lobbies,

47:07.825 --> 47:11.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airports. So, actually, here, we
have a space
of culture, a genuinely public
space, which

47:11.128 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is an indoor plaza.

47:12.963 --> 47:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES HERZOG, Architect: We
hoped for that.
But we couldn't know, because
never before

47:16.600 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a museum had such a space. And
sometimes it's
a small gap between something
great and something

47:23.908 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is a failure.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The original
design was by
Swiss architects Jacques Herzog
and Pierre

47:29.346 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
de Meuron, then little-known,
now major figures
with buildings around the world.

47:35.286 --> 47:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was they who were given
the rare opportunity
to come back 16 years later to
finish the

47:40.524 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job by creating a new wing, this
time facing
a problem partially of their own
making, for

47:47.398 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tate Modern, along with the
recreation of
Shakespeare's Globe Theater, had
helped transform

47:52.603 --> 47:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bankside area of London into
a bustling,
highly desirable neighborhood of
apartment

47:58.275 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and office buildings.

47:59.944 --> 48:03.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you make a building that
stands out,
when there's so much around it
now?

48:03.948 --> 48:08.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES HERZOG: First, we had
glass, obvious
choice for a new museum, but
everything is

48:08.686 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glass today, and especially in
the neighborhood.
So going back to brick, but make
this kind

48:14.892 --> 48:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of special lattice, which is the
perforated
brick walls, which brings light
in and out,

48:21.265 --> 48:28.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it almost breathes, was a
good decision,
I think. So, it's closer to the
original building,

48:28.205 --> 48:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but nevertheless different.

48:30.040 --> 48:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The result,
called the Switch
House, is a kind of twisted
pyramid, and its

48:34.478 --> 48:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effect is subtle, not showy.

48:36.814 --> 48:43.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES HERZOG: Sometimes, you
try to be bigger,
bigger, bigger and more, more
flashy and iconic.

48:43.954 --> 48:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't do this endlessly.
It's ridiculous.
And, sometimes, you have to
think of what

48:50.027 --> 48:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
architecture can do for people,
which is not
being bigger, bigger, bigger,
but really for

48:55.599 --> 48:59.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people and have a central
quality also
through its physicality.

48:59.637 --> 49:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Inside are angled
walls and
galleries of concrete and wood,
offering curators

49:05.576 --> 49:12.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
60 percent more exhibition space
for art of
all kinds, including video,
installations,

49:12.750 --> 49:17.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and live performance.

49:17.221 --> 49:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On opening day, this group
recreated famous
works of art, here Matisse's
Dance.

49:23.060 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tate Modern director Frances
Morris says past
gaps will be addressed, one in
particular.

49:28.032 --> 49:32.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCES MORRIS, Tate Modern: The
lack of attention
to the great work made across
the world by

49:32.570 --> 49:39.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women now. They're poorly
represented in the
marketplace. They're poorly
represented in

49:39.310 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
exhibition program at
institutions in the
U.K. and the United States.

49:44.215 --> 49:49.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we're trying to
short-circuit that by
creating a sense of visibility
and, frankly,

49:49.787 --> 49:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebration for some of those
great voices
in art.

49:52.823 --> 49:56.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another feature
of the new
building will no doubt make for
one of London's

49:56.393 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best new public spaces, the 10th
floor, 360-degree
view of the city.

50:02.800 --> 50:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early reviews in London's
famously critical
newspapers were good. Now the
public, many

50:08.706 --> 50:12.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marching over the Millennium
Bridge toward
the museum, will have its say.

50:12.977 --> 50:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From London, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

50:16.313 --> 50:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A news update before
we go.

50:26.357 --> 50:31.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A news update before
we go.

50:31.629 --> 50:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate failed to pass all
four gun control
plans brought to the floor
tonight. Votes

50:37.601 --> 50:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
split largely along party lines.
And neither
the Democratic or Republican
measures adjusting

50:43.240 --> 50:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background checks and barring
sales of guns
to those on a terror watch list
could break

50:48.679 --> 50:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the 60-vote threshold needed to
pass.

50:51.515 --> 50:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in later
tonight on "Charlie
Rose": Vice President Joe Biden
on America's

50:57.321 --> 50:59.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role in the world.

50:59.223 --> 51:01.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

51:03.093 --> 51:08.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

51:08.299 --> 51:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

51:18.342 --> 51:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
