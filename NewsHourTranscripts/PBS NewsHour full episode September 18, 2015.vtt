WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:09.243
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Judy
Woodruff is away.

00:09.243 --> 00:13.413
On the "NewsHour" tonight, two
Stories from the front lines of
the migrant crisis. Malcolm

00:13.413 --> 00:18.452
Brabant is there as more
refugees land in Greece. And
William Brangham follows up with

00:18.452 --> 00:23.423
two families now in Germany, one
finding refuge, the other more
uncertainty.

00:23.423 --> 00:28.161
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It is here, in
this social-hall-turned-refugee
camp, where they will likely
stay for months

00:28.161 --> 00:31.565
as they wait for their asylum
applications to be approved.

00:31.565 --> 00:36.336
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead:
creating a new arts capital in
the middle of the City of

00:36.336 --> 00:42.209
Angels. Jeffrey Brown looks
inside the new $140 million
museum that is the centerpiece.

00:42.209 --> 00:47.214
JEFFREY BROWN: It features 30
galleries filled with big names
in modern and contemporary

00:47.214 --> 00:52.853
art, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring,
Kara Walker, Jeff Koons, and
many others, including Jasper

00:52.853 --> 00:54.922
Johns.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.858
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday. Mark Shields and David
Brooks are with us to analyze
the

00:57.858 --> 01:00.027
week's news.

01:00.027 --> 01:06.066
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:06.066 --> 01:10.504
(BREAK)

01:10.504 --> 01:19.980
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wall Street
worried away all of the week's
gains today, amid fears

01:19.980 --> 01:25.419
of slowing growth worldwide. The
Federal Reserve had cited the
state of the world economy
yesterday

01:25.419 --> 01:30.090
when it opted not to raise
interest rates. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 290

01:30.090 --> 01:37.230
points today, to close back near
16380. The Nasdaq fell 66 points
and the S&P 500 slide

01:37.230 --> 01:42.336
32. For the week, all three
indexes lost a fraction of a
percent.

01:42.336 --> 01:47.641
Confusion reigned across
Southeastern Europe today, as
countries competed to move
desperate

01:47.641 --> 01:53.447
migrants to each other's
territory. Croatia's government
announced it could not cope,
after

01:53.447 --> 01:59.753
17,000 surged across its border
with Serbia in 48 hours. So, the
Croatians began moving

01:59.753 --> 02:05.459
migrants into Hungary, which was
working to expand its razor wire
fence.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.229
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News reports again
from the scene.

02:09.229 --> 02:15.135
JONATHAN MILLER: The
dispossessed were dumped in no
man's land between Croatia and
Hungary

02:15.135 --> 02:21.241
at 2:00 p.m. local time, brought
here in great convoys by buses
by the Croatians, unwanted,

02:21.241 --> 02:24.177
unwelcome.

02:24.177 --> 02:30.117
But this is a highly provocative
act. Neighboring Hungary has
made it abundantly clear that

02:30.117 --> 02:36.623
it doesn't want these wayfarers
either. As Hungarian Humvees and
troop reinforcements

02:36.623 --> 02:41.595
arrived, Hungary's foreign
minister accused Croatia of
encouraging masses of people to

02:41.595 --> 02:46.166
commit the criminal offense of
illegally crossing its border.

02:46.166 --> 02:51.505
Noor (ph) and her friends are
from Aleppo in Syria. After all
they have been through,

02:51.505 --> 02:56.143
being caught in the middle of a
game of chicken between two E.U.
countries doesn't faze her.

02:56.143 --> 02:59.946
The government of Hungary has
said that, if you cross, it is
illegal.

02:59.946 --> 03:07.354
WOMAN: It's illegal. What
we do? Just stay and wait.

03:07.354 --> 03:11.858
JONATHAN MILLER: A group of
asylum seekers, including a
family, broke away from the
Croatian

03:11.858 --> 03:16.830
police and made off through a
field towards the frontier.
Police gave chase and rounded

03:16.830 --> 03:21.802
them up, but suddenly the
atmosphere softened.

03:21.802 --> 03:26.807
For all the bad blood between
these two fractious neighbors, a
fleet of Hungarian buses drove

03:26.807 --> 03:32.579
into no man's land. It took ages
to load up, and it wasn't
exactly done in good grace,

03:32.579 --> 03:38.819
but the burly Hungarian police
oversaw the whole operation. The
buses drove off.

03:38.819 --> 03:45.392
The unwanted have been taken to
two registration centers close
to the Austrian border. Austrian

03:45.392 --> 03:52.766
Interior Ministry said there had
been no coordination between
Budapest and Vienna. In
Tovarnik,

03:52.766 --> 03:58.705
scene of yesterday's mayhem,
they continued to pour in from
Serbia right through night,

03:58.705 --> 04:05.479
despite seven of eight border
crossings being closed by
Croatia. A train took 1,000 to
Zagreb.

04:05.479 --> 04:10.450
But we found 3,000 people
standing for hours in searing
heat waiting for buses. They'd

04:10.450 --> 04:16.556
all spent the night in the open.
The U.N. Refugee Agency says it
can't do anything until

04:16.556 --> 04:22.395
they're asked to with specific
requests for assistance, which
they haven't had. This whole

04:22.395 --> 04:25.198
situation is actually quite
manageable, its spokesman told
me. It's just they have no

04:25.198 --> 04:27.667
clue how to do it.

04:27.667 --> 04:33.507
WOMAN: We know how to do the
job, but the responsibility, the
moral and legal responsibility

04:33.507 --> 04:41.581
here, is on the countries in the
European Union. What's missing
is a collective European

04:41.581 --> 04:44.718
Union action. Countries have
been trying to do it on their
own and then, at some stage,

04:44.718 --> 04:48.054
they say they can't. So they
need to do it together.

04:48.054 --> 04:54.427
JONATHAN MILLER: E.U. leaders
won't meet until next Wednesday.
Croatia has thrown down the

04:54.427 --> 05:00.167
gauntlet to Brussels today.
Hungary's furious and so are the
Serbs. Now everyone says they're

05:00.167 --> 05:02.335
swamped.

05:02.335 --> 05:06.039
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will have
first-hand reports on either end
of this desperate journey,

05:06.039 --> 05:09.376
Greece and Germany,
after the news summary.

05:09.376 --> 05:14.981
In Pakistan, Taliban gunmen
killed 29 people when they
stormed an air force base in the

05:14.981 --> 05:19.886
northwest. It was the militants'
deadliest strike yet at the
Pakistani military. Officials

05:19.886 --> 05:24.291
said 16 of those killed were
worshipping at a mosque inside
the compound. The assault

05:24.291 --> 05:28.995
triggered an hours-long gunfight
before the attackers were
killed.

05:28.995 --> 05:36.770
The death toll hit 182 in South
Sudan a day after a fuel truck
erupted into a fire ball.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.707
Hundreds more were being treated
for burns. The accident happened
west of the capital,

05:40.707 --> 05:44.911
Juba, as people were siphoning
gas from the truck.

05:44.911 --> 05:49.583
The United States and Russia
moved closer today to
military-to-military discussions

05:49.583 --> 05:53.220
on Syria. It came amid fresh
reports of Russian tanks and
fighter jets arriving to support

05:53.220 --> 05:55.755
the Assad regime.

05:55.755 --> 06:00.427
In London, Secretary of State
John Kerry said President Obama
believes military talks are

06:00.427 --> 06:05.665
an important next step. Kerry
met with the foreign minister
from the United Arab Emirates.

06:05.665 --> 06:08.635
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We're looking for ways in
which to try to find a

06:08.635 --> 06:13.640
common ground. Clearly, if
you're going to have a political
settlement, which we have

06:13.640 --> 06:18.945
always argued is the best and
only way to resolve Syria, you
need to have conversations

06:18.945 --> 06:23.416
with people and you need
to find the common ground.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.519
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
spoke by phone with his Russian

06:26.519 --> 06:30.657
counterpart, a first step
toward direct military talks.

06:30.657 --> 06:36.096
There's word the U.S. Marines
will ask to exclude women from
some front-line combat

06:36.096 --> 06:40.600
jobs. The Associated Press
reports the Marines have made
that formal recommendation to
the

06:40.600 --> 06:46.072
Navy secretary. It is in sharp
contrast to the Army, Navy and
Air Force. They are expected

06:46.072 --> 06:50.644
to open all battlefield
positions to women.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.847
Republicans in the U.S. House
voted today to block Planned
Parenthood's federal funding

06:53.847 --> 06:58.985
for a year. Party leaders hoped
the votes would appease
conservatives, and persuade

06:58.985 --> 07:04.891
them not to force a government
shutdown over the issue. The
debate was sparked by secretly

07:04.891 --> 07:09.062
recorded videos of Planned
Parenthood officials discussing
how they harvest fetal tissue
for

07:09.062 --> 07:10.597
research.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.868
REP. DIANE BLACK (R), Tennessee:
Congressional investigations are
under way. But there are

07:14.868 --> 07:20.106
more than enough lingering
questions to stop the flow of
money, taxpayer dollars, to this

07:20.106 --> 07:24.210
abortion giant until
our work is complete.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.147
REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
(D), Florida: As a woman,
mother, and breast cancer
survivor,

07:27.147 --> 07:32.085
I refuse to take that threat
lying down. Republicans' own
investigations turned up
nothing. Yet

07:32.085 --> 07:35.422
some of their members are
willing to risk women's lives
just to score political points.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.891
Enough is enough.

07:37.891 --> 07:42.128
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senate
Democrats have vowed to block
the bill in that chamber.

07:42.128 --> 07:46.399
A South Carolina man is now
accused of failing to sound the
alarm before the church
shootings

07:46.399 --> 07:51.237
in Charleston and lying about it
afterward. Joey Meek pleaded not
guilty today to charges

07:51.237 --> 07:57.110
in a federal indictment. Meek
has said Dylann Roof told him he
was about to -- quote -- "do

07:57.110 --> 08:01.815
something crazy," but knew no
specifics. The FBI now says that
was a lie. Nine people died

08:01.815 --> 08:04.718
in the church attack.

08:04.718 --> 08:10.223
The United States has handed
over one of China's most wanted
fugitives from corruption
charges.

08:10.223 --> 08:16.696
He had been in this country
since 2001. State television
showed businessman Yang Jinjun

08:16.696 --> 08:22.802
arriving back in China today and
being taken away in handcuffs to
face bribery and embezzlement

08:22.802 --> 08:26.473
charges. Chinese officials
hailed the development.

08:26.473 --> 08:32.712
MAN (through translator): The
successful repatriation of Yang
Jinjun is the result of the
close

08:32.712 --> 08:37.817
communication and cooperation
between Chinese and U.S. law
enforcement authorities. This

08:37.817 --> 08:42.522
marks major progress in
China-U.S. law enforcement
cooperation in pursuit of
corruption suspects.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.226
We appreciate the efforts and
help that the U.S. government
provided.

08:46.226 --> 08:50.663
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the past,
the U.S. has been reluctant to
send fugitives back to China,

08:50.663 --> 08:55.201
given its history of human
rights abuses. This new move
comes just days before President

08:55.201 --> 08:59.539
Xi Jinping's first state
visit to Washington.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.076
President Obama spoke with Cuban
President Raul Castro today,
ahead of the pope's visit

09:03.076 --> 09:07.247
to both countries. The White
House says they discussed
efforts to restore ties during
the

09:07.247 --> 09:12.952
phone call. It came on the same
day that the U.S. eased its
longtime embargo of Cuba. New

09:12.952 --> 09:17.090
rules are designed to make it
easier for tourism, telephone
and Internet firms to establish

09:17.090 --> 09:20.560
a presence in the island nation.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.598
The Environmental Protection
Agency is accusing Volkswagen of
deliberately violating clean

09:25.598 --> 09:31.604
air laws and ordering a halt. It
means fixing nearly half a
million V.W. and Audi diesel

09:31.604 --> 09:38.678
cars made since 2008. They
contain so-called defeat devices
that activate emissions controls

09:38.678 --> 09:43.216
only during official testing.
The systems are turned off
during normal driving. V.W.

09:43.216 --> 09:48.021
could be fined more
than $18 billion.

09:48.021 --> 09:52.559
And campaigning wrapped up today
in Greece ahead of Sunday's
general election with no

09:52.559 --> 09:57.096
clear winner in sight. Leftist
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
resigned last month after
members

09:57.096 --> 10:01.901
of his Syriza Party rebelled
against new austerity measures.
Today, preparations were under
way

10:01.901 --> 10:04.904
to set up polling stations.
Municipal workers were busy
delivering voting booths, ballot

10:04.904 --> 10:08.475
boxes and other supplies.

10:08.475 --> 10:13.012
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two more takes on this great,
desperate migration;

10:13.012 --> 10:17.417
Malcolm Brabant is there as more
refugees come ashore in Greece,
while William Brangham

10:17.417 --> 10:22.021
reports from one of the
endpoints of the journey,
Germany; also, the analysis of
Mark Shields

10:22.021 --> 10:35.935
and David Brooks, and
much, much more.

10:35.935 --> 10:40.707
There are many way stations on
the long and hard march from the
killing fields of the

10:40.707 --> 10:44.477
Middle East, North Africa and
Afghanistan. Many of those
perilous journeys stop over

10:44.477 --> 10:48.314
on the Greek islands
off the Turkish coast.

10:48.314 --> 10:52.252
Tonight, special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports from the
Greek isle of Lesbos, where

10:52.252 --> 10:55.788
tens of thousands of refugees
and migrants have landed on
their uncertain voyage toward

10:55.788 --> 10:59.125
Europe.

10:59.125 --> 11:06.065
MALCOLM BRABANT: Just after
dawn, and volunteers direct the
day's first arrivals to make the

11:06.065 --> 11:11.638
five-mile crossing from Turkey.
The flimsy boat was spotted by
Englishman Eric Kempson,

11:11.638 --> 11:17.143
a Lesbos resident, who's been up
at dawn every day for months to
shepherd the refugees to

11:17.143 --> 11:21.648
safety. Kempson has inspired
other Europeans to help, at a
time when the E.U. is bitterly

11:21.648 --> 11:24.884
divided over how to respond.

11:24.884 --> 11:31.324
ERIC KEMPSON, Volunteer: Now
we're at 40, 45. The other day,
we had 50 boats. You know,

11:31.324 --> 11:38.631
50 boats is 2,500 people. It's
absolutely crazy. And the amount
of accidents is unbelievable,

11:38.631 --> 11:44.304
boats sinking, people in the
water. We're rescuing every
single day.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.374
We're civilized people here in
Europe. And for these people to
have suffered the way

11:48.374 --> 11:52.078
they have suffered, when you see
them get off the boats, they're
all elated and everything

11:52.078 --> 11:55.515
else, and then you see them a
few hours or a few days later,
they're different people.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.383
They don't know what the
hell is going on here.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.020
MALCOLM BRABANT: Today's sea
was kind. It isn't always.

12:01.020 --> 12:09.896
How do you feel
about being here?

12:09.896 --> 12:14.133
MAN: Happy.

12:14.133 --> 12:21.975
MALCOLM BRABANT: Only a handful
of children were on the boat.
Most were men, whose first

12:21.975 --> 12:26.479
thought was to phone home.
Kempson's wife, Philippa, has
noticed a clear trend.

12:26.479 --> 12:31.317
PHILIPPA KEMPSON, Volunteer: The
last weeks, most of the Syrian
people are from Damascus,

12:31.317 --> 12:35.421
and the stories we are hearing
is that they have hung on and
hung on. And now Damascus

12:35.421 --> 12:40.560
is -- it's -- the war is
spreading to all the areas of
Damascus. So, they're leaving

12:40.560 --> 12:45.164
really quickly now. These are
people that were in Damascus a
week ago.

12:45.164 --> 12:50.470
So they're running really
quickly. So, it's nothing to do
with the numbers pulling them,

12:50.470 --> 12:55.742
because they know how bad the
situation here is. They're very
media-savvy. They have their

12:55.742 --> 13:00.413
phones. They're in contact with
people who've already come. They
know how bad it is. But

13:00.413 --> 13:07.220
their -- what's the alternative?
They're not allowed to fly to
Europe. They have to make

13:07.220 --> 13:12.325
this journey. We have forced
them into -- the more fences we
build, the more we force people

13:12.325 --> 13:15.094
to make journeys like this.

13:15.094 --> 13:20.133
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's estimated
that 60 percent of those
crossing to Lesbos are from
Syria.

13:20.133 --> 13:30.309
MAN: Life there, it's not good.
It's not healthy. Children, it's
not safe. Our home, it's not

13:30.309 --> 13:35.081
safe. Everything is not safe.

13:35.081 --> 13:39.185
MALCOLM BRABANT: The next
biggest national group setting
out for Northern Europe comes

13:39.185 --> 13:42.955
from Afghanistan, where fears
about of ongoing violence and
insecurity, driven by the
Taliban

13:42.955 --> 13:46.459
and Islamic State, abound.

13:46.459 --> 13:53.299
MAN: The most important point is
just the insecurity and
different bad situations that

13:53.299 --> 13:58.671
forced us and others to leave
our homeland and hometown. And
just we want security, we

13:58.671 --> 14:02.975
want a shelter in order to have
a better life in the future.

14:02.975 --> 14:07.880
Our education is left incomplete
in our country. But we are
trying our best. And this is the

14:07.880 --> 14:11.951
target and aim of our parents
also and others to pave the
ground of education for us, for

14:11.951 --> 14:14.554
our small brothers.

14:14.554 --> 14:19.425
MALCOLM BRABANT: The people
behind me are waiting for a bus
to take them to Mytilini,

14:19.425 --> 14:24.130
which is Lesbos' main town. And
that's an improvement on when I
was here four months

14:24.130 --> 14:27.400
ago, because they had to march
for two or three days to reach
the ports to catch a ferry

14:27.400 --> 14:30.303
to Athens.

14:30.303 --> 14:34.373
But the European Union's
inability to construct a
coherent policy to deal with
this crisis

14:34.373 --> 14:39.479
means that the new arrivals have
many more difficulties than
those who have trodden this

14:39.479 --> 14:44.684
road before. Getting to the
fringes of Greece is painfully
slow, but every day, new
obstacles

14:44.684 --> 14:50.123
are being placed in their way in
the Balkans and Central Europe.

14:50.123 --> 14:54.293
But their first impression of
Europe was one of kindness, as
they were greeted with food,

14:54.293 --> 15:00.767
fluids and genuine concern. For
this child, the journey was
quickly forgotten in a slightly

15:00.767 --> 15:08.207
surreal encounter on the beach.
This young Syrian recorded his
landfall for posterity.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.978
He's making history. But the
scenes he will capture in the
coming days may not be so
peaceful.

15:11.978 --> 15:16.415
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Lesbos.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.786
HARI SREENIVASAN: For many of
the people the "NewsHour"
correspondents and teams have
met,

15:19.786 --> 15:23.923
their ultimate destination,
their promised land is Germany.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.528
What was initially an open-door
policy has seen modifications,
as German authorities

15:28.528 --> 15:32.598
have reinstituted border
controls, and draft legislation
would limit generous state
benefits

15:32.598 --> 15:36.402
to only certain
refugee populations.

15:36.402 --> 15:41.607
William Brangham updates on the
stories of two families he first
met in Hungary. Tonight,

15:41.607 --> 15:47.079
we meet them in Germany, where
their lives have taken, for now,
very different turns.

15:47.079 --> 15:52.218
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While refugees
and migrants have clashed
violently with police on the

15:52.218 --> 15:56.255
Hungarian border this week,
their attempts to enter into
Europe are, for many of them,

15:56.255 --> 16:00.526
just the beginning of a
much longer journey.

16:00.526 --> 16:04.931
Last week, we followed two
Syrian families along the
grueling, unpredictable
migration

16:04.931 --> 16:08.768
from the Middle East towards
Germany. Both suffered sleepless
nights, chaotic border

16:08.768 --> 16:12.471
crossings, and a maze of
ever-changing rules and
challenges.

16:12.471 --> 16:18.077
Now, only a week later,
so much had changed.

16:18.077 --> 16:28.254
HAMEED YAKDI, Refugee (through
translator): It's a good
feeling. After a long, hard
effort

16:28.254 --> 16:31.390
and great risk, we arrived here.
Thank God that we made it here.
It's a very strange

16:31.390 --> 16:33.392
feeling.

16:33.392 --> 16:37.630
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hameed Yakdi
and his family from Syria were
lucky in many ways. Not only

16:37.630 --> 16:41.634
did they make it through Hungary
before this week's violence
broke out and the sealing

16:41.634 --> 16:46.038
of the border, but, in Austria,
they met Hameed's brother,
Muhammaed, who immigrated to
Germany

16:46.038 --> 16:50.076
two years ago, and helped guide
them the rest of the way.

16:50.076 --> 16:56.716
HAMEED YAKDI (through
translator): I felt safe the
moment I reached Germany. I have

16:56.716 --> 17:00.820
a family that welcomed and
helped me. I have not had to
struggle. When I ask, they
answer

17:00.820 --> 17:04.156
right away. They have lived here
a long time, and they make me
feel at home.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.660
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But many of
the tens of thousands of
refugees who've already arrived

17:07.660 --> 17:13.399
in Germany are not quite as
lucky. We last saw Majdoleen
Diab exhausted, bedding down

17:13.399 --> 17:16.636
for the night with her husband
and daughter in a warehouse on
the Austria-Hungary border.

17:16.636 --> 17:22.608
At that point, they'd traveled
thousands of miles by boat and
train, car and foot.

17:22.608 --> 17:26.312
But now, a week later, they have
finally arrived in Germany.

17:26.312 --> 17:32.585
MAJDOLEEN DIAB, Refugee: The
journey, it's very hard. You
see. We need a month for rest.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.955
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Their
2-year-old daughter, Maral (ph),
was sick with a cold from the

17:35.955 --> 17:40.092
road, but at least they now
had time to sleep it off.

17:40.092 --> 17:44.230
Soon after arriving in Germany,
the Diabs were transferred north
by German authorities

17:44.230 --> 17:49.201
to a small town on the Czech
border. Majdoleen says they were
afraid they were being deported.

17:49.201 --> 17:56.575
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: We are opening
GPS, oh, oh, we are near the
Czech. We are near the Czech.

17:56.575 --> 18:03.849
We think -- he give them to
Czech. We are worried. But we
were -- arrived. It's a very,

18:03.849 --> 18:07.820
very wonderful village.

18:07.820 --> 18:15.761
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It is here, in
this
social-hall-turned-refugee-camp,
where they will likely stay for

18:15.761 --> 18:20.666
they wait for their asylum
applications to be approved.
This is now home to about 100

18:20.666 --> 18:24.403
asylum seekers from various
countries and backgrounds. All
were given I.D. bracelets,

18:24.403 --> 18:27.340
and for now, instructions
to simply stay put.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.576
Juliane Scheer is a German
asylum lawyer in Munich.

18:30.576 --> 18:35.081
JULIANE SCHEER, Asylum Lawyer:
For the first three months,
people have to live in certain

18:35.081 --> 18:40.519
refugee centers. And, from
there, they are distributed.

18:40.519 --> 18:46.625
They have a special legal
status. They cannot be deported,
but they also have certain
restrictions,

18:46.625 --> 18:51.297
for example, for the place where
they can live. They cannot just
look for -- for work

18:51.297 --> 18:56.602
or they cannot just look for an
apartment. They have to stay in
these refugee camps.

18:56.602 --> 19:04.643
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: It's hard.
Waiting, it's hard, because we
haven't know what we are waiting

19:04.643 --> 19:11.183
now. We have breakfast, stay
about one hour, taking shower,
eating lunch, and stay, not

19:11.183 --> 19:14.220
-- not important.

19:14.220 --> 19:21.761
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back in
Munich, the Yakdi family is now
staying with extended family,

19:21.761 --> 19:26.565
and they may eventually have to
go through the same process and
move away. Their cousin

19:26.565 --> 19:30.403
Ruaa has been through it before.
She came to Germany 15 years ago
as a refugee from

19:30.403 --> 19:33.105
Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

19:33.105 --> 19:40.446
RUAA ADNA SULAIMAN, Yakdi Family
Cousin: They have to be patient.
And they have to bear

19:40.446 --> 19:47.019
everything they will be facing.
It's not hunger. It's not
unsafety. It's -- everything is
offered

19:47.019 --> 19:55.561
for them here. But the
procedures, it will take time,
and some people give up so
quickly.

19:55.561 --> 19:59.331
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hameed's
brother, Muhammaed, came from
Syria two years ago. In
alternating

19:59.331 --> 20:03.602
English, Arabic and German, he
explained his reasons for
immigrating.

20:03.602 --> 20:08.507
MAN (through translator): When
my brother asked me the first
time, he wanted to come

20:08.507 --> 20:13.512
to Germany. I said, come, but
not for you, for the children.
Here, your children can

20:13.512 --> 20:17.850
learn, study better, better than
even in our country when we
didn't have war. Here, it

20:17.850 --> 20:21.053
is better than our country. We
have to say that, better
learning, studying, a better

20:21.053 --> 20:24.657
life.

20:24.657 --> 20:32.264
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While she
waits to begin a new life with
her family, Majdoleen Diab

20:32.264 --> 20:36.068
has already started learning
German. The German government
says they will grant asylum to

20:36.068 --> 20:40.573
virtually all Syrian applicants,
but the process could still take
months.

20:40.573 --> 20:45.344
She says they're committed to
starting a new life here. She
wants to go back to being a

20:45.344 --> 20:49.715
hairdresser, and Ahmad wants to
return to work again in metal
fabrication. And, most

20:49.715 --> 20:53.819
importantly, they want little
Maral to get to school.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.690
AHMAD DIAB, Refugee (through
translator): Once I start
working, I can build a new
future

20:57.690 --> 21:05.331
here. At least my daughter gets
an education and can finish her
schooling.

21:05.331 --> 21:10.469
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Maral will go
to a German school, read German
books, have German friends.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.506
And while they're grateful to be
here, Majdoleen says that, in
many ways, her daughter will

21:13.506 --> 21:16.575
grow up in a very
different world.

21:16.575 --> 21:25.484
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: It's very hard,
because the person, he leaves
his country and his parents,

21:25.484 --> 21:36.829
his friends, his memories,
everything. In Syria, we had
noise and many people and many

21:36.829 --> 21:45.304
cafe and many everything. And we
had the neighbors. We had
friends. We had everything. But,
here,

21:45.304 --> 21:49.608
we feel lonely, lonely here.

21:49.608 --> 22:01.187
We leave our country for her
future. We need a future for my
daughter. And our country

22:01.187 --> 22:05.758
now, we haven't future there.

22:05.758 --> 22:10.129
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There are many
challenges ahead for the
thousands of refugees who have

22:10.129 --> 22:13.599
already arrived in Germany and
other European countries. But,
for most of them, the first

22:13.599 --> 22:16.535
challenge is to wait.

22:16.535 --> 22:21.440
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

22:21.440 --> 22:30.716
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

22:30.716 --> 22:35.487
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
our phones have become the new
election battleground;

22:35.487 --> 22:40.893
a new modern arts center for the
City of Angels; plus, using
humor to tackle issues of race,

22:40.893 --> 22:44.897
our Brief But Spectacular
chat with Baratunde Thurston.

22:44.897 --> 22:50.536
But, first, the second
Republican debate is in the
books, so what's next for the
candidates?

22:50.536 --> 22:55.908
Is Donald Trump reopening the
discussion about where President
Obama was born? And Pope Francis

22:55.908 --> 23:01.747
is making a historic visit to
U.S., with stops at the White
House and Capitol Hill.

23:01.747 --> 23:04.450
To the analysis of Shields and
Brooks, we go. That's syndicated
columnist Mark Shields

23:04.450 --> 23:05.985
and New York Times
columnist David Brooks.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.722
All right, David, I
want to start with you.

23:09.722 --> 23:16.028
This debate has happened now.
Who has won, who has lost kind
of happened last night.

23:16.028 --> 23:20.332
We have been talking about that
for a while. But who capitalizes
on this going forward?

23:20.332 --> 23:24.703
Who is actually able to use this
to leverage more fund-raisers?
Because that's going to

23:24.703 --> 23:27.339
become more important in
the next couple of months.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.475
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first, I
have been predicting for 37
straight weeks that Donald Trump
will

23:29.475 --> 23:29.642
fade.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.577
(LAUGHTER)

23:31.577 --> 23:35.547
DAVID BROOKS: And I could be
wrong this time. But I'm
confident. So I may be wrong,
but

23:35.547 --> 23:39.885
I'm confidently wrong, that I
think he's going to begin to
fade, in part because I think

23:39.885 --> 23:43.789
he's gotten a little boring
and also a little hapless.

23:43.789 --> 23:47.593
He can afford to look offensive.
He can afford to look
distasteful. He can't afford to
be

23:47.593 --> 23:50.929
boring or incompetent, because
his mastery is the whole basis
of his campaign. So, I'm

23:50.929 --> 23:53.966
feeling a slide.
So, we will see.

23:53.966 --> 23:59.038
As for the risers, it's no
accident. It's no -- not
controversial. Carly Fiorina, if

23:59.038 --> 24:04.310
you're on stage with 11 people,
one of the acts of genius you
have to have is the ability

24:04.310 --> 24:09.748
to create a signature moment
that can be broadcast and
rebroadcast. She has that. She
has both

24:09.748 --> 24:15.487
the creativity to create those
moments with some nice
phraseology and also the
passion.

24:15.487 --> 24:19.625
And so she's clearly, I think,
rising to the top tier. This is
a party that does -- I do

24:19.625 --> 24:24.129
not think, at the end of the
day, they do not want crazy, so
I don't think they want

24:24.129 --> 24:27.766
Trump. They also don't want
Milquetoast. They don't want
vanilla. And Jeb Bush, I'm
afraid,

24:27.766 --> 24:31.503
is sort of stuck in
pseudo-vanilla land.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.773
And so they're going to want --
I think Fiorina is right up
there and I think Marco Rubio

24:34.773 --> 24:39.878
would be the other one, bit of
an outsider, a genius for taking
complicated situations

24:39.878 --> 24:44.450
and explaining them in a way
that is clear, without being
oversimplified. And so I think

24:44.450 --> 24:49.154
you have those two, Fiorina and
Rubio, who will get the biggest
boosts.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.824
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
besides those two, Mark, who
takes this to the bank and

24:51.824 --> 24:55.160
makes a convincing case to
people with deep pockets?

24:55.160 --> 24:59.832
MARK SHIELDS: Is the debate
over? I'm not sure that CNN was
going to give up that audience.

24:59.832 --> 25:03.168
It just -- it kept going
into extra innings.

25:03.168 --> 25:10.909
Hari, I don't disagree with
David certainly about Carly
Fiorina. She was the consensus

25:10.909 --> 25:17.049
breakthrough winner. She did
several things. She did have the
signature moment, as David

25:17.049 --> 25:22.421
mentioned, but she was also
fact-specific. In other words,
people argue the facts and

25:22.421 --> 25:28.894
question some of the facts, but
running against Donald Trump,
who is a substance-free
candidate

25:28.894 --> 25:38.170
and would -- avoids issues like
a T-shirt, the reality is that
it gave her a particular

25:38.170 --> 25:40.572
standing.

25:40.572 --> 25:48.347
The, also, advantage she had is,
she took that insult of Trump's
and turned it on him

25:48.347 --> 25:52.718
in an organic fashion. She
didn't -- in other words, she
didn't come in, and this is --
grew

25:52.718 --> 25:58.190
right out of the event itself,
out of the debate, and it came
to her, and she grabbed

25:58.190 --> 26:05.397
that moment where Trump had
mentioned remembering Jeb Bush's
comment on cutting women's
health.

26:05.397 --> 26:10.736
And just as women -- just as Mr.
Trump remembers Jeb Bush's
comment, women will remember
what

26:10.736 --> 26:15.040
he said. So I think, in that
sense, we're always looking for
something shiny, fresh

26:15.040 --> 26:18.310
and new in the press. And voters
are to some degree and this
year. And I think she fills

26:18.310 --> 26:22.281
that niche.

26:22.281 --> 26:28.520
I think that John Kasich, the
governor of Ohio, missed an
opportunity. He dwelled on

26:28.520 --> 26:36.595
his 18 years in Congress, which
is not a credential that people
are looking in this outsider
year.

26:36.595 --> 26:42.968
I thought Marco Rubio was
incredibly competent. He spoke
in complete sentences, complete
paragraphs.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.270
His text was good.

26:45.270 --> 26:50.642
He's too senatorial. And that's
the problem. If you look at his
language and presentation,

26:50.642 --> 26:56.248
it comes across as too
senatorial. Again, voters are
not looking for a senator. And

26:56.248 --> 27:05.224
I just think Jeb Bush was -- it
wasn't working for him. It
wasn't natural. His
confrontation

27:05.224 --> 27:10.729
over his -- the insult by Trump
to his wife, he backed down. And
I just didn't think he

27:10.729 --> 27:15.400
had a good -- Scott Walker, the
governor of Wisconsin, had to
reassure his donors afterwards.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.338
And it hadn't gone well.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.574
That was -- the indication was
that by -- he attacked the
press. He attacked CNN,
criticized

27:22.574 --> 27:24.409
them.

27:24.409 --> 27:28.747
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, there was
a recent moment where a voter
asked Trump a question, and

27:28.747 --> 27:33.652
implicit in that question was
the birthplace of President
Obama. We're going to go ahead

27:33.652 --> 27:36.054
and play a clip of that and also
a reaction from Hillary Clinton.
And we will talk about

27:36.054 --> 27:37.990
some other reactions. Let's
just go to the tape.

27:37.990 --> 27:44.930
MAN: We have a problem in this
country. It's called Muslims. We
know our current president

27:44.930 --> 27:48.200
is one. You know he's
not even an American.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.935
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We need this
question. This is the first
question.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.703
(CROSSTALK)

27:51.703 --> 27:56.508
MAN: But, anyway, we have
training camps growing where
they want to kill us.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.278
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be
looking at a lot of different
things.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.915
And a lot of people are saying
that, and a lot of people are
saying that bad things are

28:02.915 --> 28:06.318
happening out there. We're going
to be looking at that and plenty
of other things.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.454
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I would,
you know, call on him and call
on

28:09.454 --> 28:17.563
all of the candidates to stop
this descent into the kind of
hateful, mean-spirited, divisive

28:17.563 --> 28:20.966
rhetoric that we have seen too
much of in the last months.

28:20.966 --> 28:24.169
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Mark, the
Hillary reaction is almost
predictable. But other
Republican

28:24.169 --> 28:26.705
candidates came out
against this as well.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.309
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.
Chris Christie on "The Today
Show" this morning said --
criticized

28:30.309 --> 28:33.512
it and said he would not have
done it. Lindsey Graham was even
more vocal on an Andrea Mitchell

28:33.512 --> 28:36.949
interview today.

28:36.949 --> 28:45.357
To me, this is -- Barack Obama
is a Christian who was born in
Hawaii. Barack Obama is a

28:45.357 --> 28:51.396
Christian who was born in
Hawaii. I mean, what we have is
feeding paranoia. Right now,

28:51.396 --> 28:59.104
43 percent of Republicans,
according to CNN's latest poll,
believe Barack Obama is a
Muslim;

28:59.104 --> 29:04.209
54 percent of Trump supporters
in the same survey believe he
is.

29:04.209 --> 29:09.848
Donald Trump has stirred this,
he's sustained it, he's
exploited it. This is a real
character

29:09.848 --> 29:14.653
check, and it's a character
defect, if you don't stand up
and say this is unacceptable

29:14.653 --> 29:18.657
and it shall not stand.

29:18.657 --> 29:25.030
If a Republican cannot criticize
Donald Trump on this -- on these
grounds of not rejecting

29:25.030 --> 29:28.700
and rebutting something so
outrageous and indefensible as
-- in this question, then

29:28.700 --> 29:30.102
they just ought to
withdraw from public life.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.003
HARI SREENIVASAN: David?

29:31.003 --> 29:34.072
DAVID BROOKS: Yes,
I sort of agree.

29:34.072 --> 29:37.976
You would hope that everybody in
this day and age has sort of a
bigotry response, that

29:37.976 --> 29:41.813
when somebody says something
clearly bigoted, like Muslims
are a problem in this country,

29:41.813 --> 29:47.419
that you have a response, and
the response is one of visceral
disgust, and you would

29:47.419 --> 29:50.489
hope we would hear something
said about African-Americans,
Latinos, black -- women,
whatever group it

29:50.489 --> 29:54.426
is -- and he somehow
didn't have that response.

29:54.426 --> 29:58.463
And, in contrast to John McCain,
four years ago -- four years
ago, had a similar question,

29:58.463 --> 30:02.034
and he did have that response:
Oh, that's a man of honor.

30:02.034 --> 30:06.872
And one of the things that's
interesting to me about Trump is
99 percent of businesspeople

30:06.872 --> 30:10.742
are people of business, but also
people of honor. And so they
don't check their values

30:10.742 --> 30:13.578
or their principles at the door
when they do their business
deals.

30:13.578 --> 30:17.883
So, when you hear Trump talk
about his business, oh, I bought
that politician, I bought that

30:17.883 --> 30:21.386
politician, I contributed to
them, I contributed to them, the
only thing that matters is the

30:21.386 --> 30:25.524
outcome, is the bottom line, the
revenue thing. And that carries
over into the way he talks

30:25.524 --> 30:27.592
about politics.

30:27.592 --> 30:32.931
He evaluates politicians, he
evaluates policies and he
evaluates events by the polling
data.

30:32.931 --> 30:36.868
And if you have got no
qualitative, no moral calculus
going on in your head and you're

30:36.868 --> 30:40.839
all just looking at the numbers,
well, then you get this sort of
moral obtuseness and

30:40.839 --> 30:43.041
no reaction to what was
clearly a bigoted statement.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.277
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

30:45.277 --> 30:51.049
Now to someone who has a clearly
moral compass paying a visit to
the United States, the pope,

30:51.049 --> 30:58.690
really, in several ways, I think
reintroducing the world to the
idea that this position has

30:58.690 --> 31:01.960
transformative power in it.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.931
And that doesn't necessarily sit
well with everyone. I was doing
a Periscope earlier,

31:05.931 --> 31:10.135
kind of behind-the-scenes look,
and someone says, how do you
feel about the pope rewriting

31:10.135 --> 31:12.604
the Ten Commandments, right?
There are many people around the
world who think perhaps

31:12.604 --> 31:15.340
this progressiveness
is too much.

31:15.340 --> 31:21.313
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the pope,
Pope Francis, is coming to
Washington. He's never been to

31:21.313 --> 31:23.415
Washington, never been to the
United States before. We know
we're the center of the
universe.

31:23.415 --> 31:27.185
Somehow, it has escaped
him in his entire life.

31:27.185 --> 31:33.525
But several things. One is, he's
the antithesis to big-money
politics. I mean, this is
somebody

31:33.525 --> 31:40.766
who spends his time with -- he
listens to the voiceless. He
remembers the forgotten.

31:40.766 --> 31:45.070
He sees the overlooked, whether
it's the immigrant, or the
refugee, as we saw, or the day
worker,

31:45.070 --> 31:49.541
or the sick, the
handicapped, or the lonely.

31:49.541 --> 31:56.114
I mean, he really does -- he
does embody -- I fear he's going
to make both parties -- I

31:56.114 --> 31:59.451
know he's going to make both
parties very uncomfortable,
because his message is not

31:59.451 --> 32:05.690
trimmed for politics. He's going
to make the Republicans quite
uncomfortable on the question

32:05.690 --> 32:11.863
of poverty and the obligation
that we have to act
collectively. He's very
pro-politics.

32:11.863 --> 32:15.200
He believes in politics.

32:15.200 --> 32:21.173
He's very strong on the
environment and on climate
change, contrary to many
Republicans,

32:21.173 --> 32:29.381
including Marco Rubio. But, at
the same time, he speaks fondly
and well and consistently

32:29.381 --> 32:36.755
about protecting the unborn and
those in the late stages of life
who face death. He is

32:36.755 --> 32:43.228
-- really, it's going to be
remarkable to watch Joe Biden
and John Boehner, both
Catholics,

32:43.228 --> 32:47.265
the vice president and the
speaker, sitting behind him, and
applauding different passengers

32:47.265 --> 32:50.569
and kind of pretending
they didn't hear others.

32:50.569 --> 32:55.207
So -- but I hope it doesn't
become political, because this
truly is a remarkable spiritual

32:55.207 --> 32:57.108
moment in a very secular city.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.277
HARI SREENIVASAN: David?

32:59.277 --> 33:01.246
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I just want
to underline that last comment.
I hope we don't overpoliticize

33:01.246 --> 33:03.548
this visit.

33:03.548 --> 33:07.385
The first thing we're going to
see is our countrymen,
thousands, millions of them
moved

33:07.385 --> 33:10.922
by faith, their eyes looking to
heaven, their heart warmed by
God's love. And we're going

33:10.922 --> 33:15.994
to see that in public. And we're
going to see that in tens of
millions of people. And

33:15.994 --> 33:20.632
that will be a moment of seeing
faith in a way we rarely see it
in this country in public.

33:20.632 --> 33:25.036
And, secondly, we will see the
example of the man. The message
is the person. It's the

33:25.036 --> 33:30.108
way he conducts himself. His
love for the poor is not out of
any self-congratulatory.

33:30.108 --> 33:35.780
He -- whether you're Jewish,
Muslim, atheist, whatever, he is
the embodiment of the Christian

33:35.780 --> 33:40.986
virtues that I think we all
admire, the -- seeing the
meekest, seeing the poorest,
seeing the

33:40.986 --> 33:44.823
lowest, and lifting them up, and
seeing the brokenness in people,
and then lifting them

33:44.823 --> 33:47.826
up with joy.

33:47.826 --> 33:51.963
And so, to me, it will be a
theater of spiritual -- a
spiritual theater more than a
political

33:51.963 --> 33:56.201
theater. And I suspect tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands
of people's lives will

33:56.201 --> 34:01.406
be changed, in the way that
politics can never change them,
from within. Their lives will

34:01.406 --> 34:04.509
be transformed because they will
be at this visit. And they will
be moved by something

34:04.509 --> 34:08.346
they had never felt or only
have felt weakly before.

34:08.346 --> 34:12.617
And to me, that's just a seismic
event, whatever happens to our
political culture.

34:12.617 --> 34:16.688
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, so what
about -- how does that translate
when that spiritual theater

34:16.688 --> 34:21.459
is finished? Does that translate
into any sort of policy action
or rethinking something

34:21.459 --> 34:25.263
that might be in the works
in Congress that's stalled?

34:25.263 --> 34:27.933
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I hope it
transforms hearts. And I hope it
transforms hearts in the ways

34:27.933 --> 34:30.635
Mark just suggested.

34:30.635 --> 34:35.573
The pope is not going to visit
the homeless or the prisoners
once in his visit. He's doing

34:35.573 --> 34:40.512
it six, seven, eight times in
the visit. So, the constant
focus will be there on those

34:40.512 --> 34:45.250
who are hurting the most. And I
think that enlivened attention
will carry over into people's

34:45.250 --> 34:49.321
eyes, both in their private
lives and their private giving,
but also in their public lives.

34:49.321 --> 34:53.224
Mark has said this many times
over the years. We have a
political culture focused on the

34:53.224 --> 34:58.196
middle class. We have lost some
of the contact with the poor,
some of the contact with the

34:58.196 --> 35:02.600
needy, and not only -- and not
from high to low, and, frankly,
some of the compassionate

35:02.600 --> 35:07.439
conservatism and some of
progressivism has been from high
to low, but treating the poor

35:07.439 --> 35:12.177
as those closest to God and
worthy of respect maybe even
more than everybody else.

35:12.177 --> 35:15.413
And that's an attention that has
been absent from our political
culture or in short supply,

35:15.413 --> 35:19.451
and maybe it will be in
slightly bigger supply.

35:19.451 --> 35:26.858
MARK SHIELDS: I think David said
it very, very well, just that
wherever he goes, he

35:26.858 --> 35:31.129
brings the cameras with him, and
an incredible number of cameras,
as we know.

35:31.129 --> 35:35.066
But as soon as he finishes
Congress -- and it's the hottest
ticket in the history of

35:35.066 --> 35:39.104
Capitol Hill. I mean, people are
fighting to get in. Former
members and senators can't

35:39.104 --> 35:44.809
even get into the gallery to
hear him. They have set up a
JumboTron outside.

35:44.809 --> 35:50.715
He's going to have lunch with
the poorest of the poor in the
Center City in Washington

35:50.715 --> 35:56.321
sponsored by Catholic Charities.
I mean, these are the addicted.
These are people with alcohol

35:56.321 --> 36:01.359
problems, with psychological
problems, the homeless. And he
doesn't allow us to look

36:01.359 --> 36:05.196
away. He forces us to examine
those who are living on the
outskirts of hope.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.664
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

36:06.664 --> 36:11.202
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thanks so much for joining us.

36:11.202 --> 36:17.609
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

36:17.609 --> 36:22.947
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you heard,
presidential campaigns are
ramping up their rhetoric along

36:22.947 --> 36:29.054
with ads and events. But one of
the most intense fights under
way is happening off camera.

36:29.054 --> 36:32.924
Our political director, Lisa
Desjardins, reports on the 2016
battle taking place on our
computers

36:32.924 --> 36:35.727
and phones.

36:35.727 --> 36:41.499
LISA DESJARDINS: With all the
gentility of a marching band,
the presidential campaign

36:41.499 --> 36:46.271
is under way and booming. But
like much of America, you may
think the 2016 presidential

36:46.271 --> 36:51.009
fight has yet to really
enter your life.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.311
Do you think any of the
campaigns are paying any
attention to you right now?

36:53.311 --> 36:54.312
WOMAN: Not really, no.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.246
MAN: Very little.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.581
WOMAN: Not a whole lot.

36:56.581 --> 36:57.615
MAN: Probably almost zero.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.818
WOMAN: Not really, no.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.153
LISA DESJARDINS: And last
question, do you have a cell
phone?

37:02.153 --> 37:03.054
WOMAN: Of course.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.355
MAN: Yes, I do.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.657
WOMAN: I do.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.526
MAN: Yes, I have a cell phone.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.361
MAN: Yes, I have a cell phone.
It's a very big part of my life
because I do a lot with

37:10.361 --> 37:12.597
my cell phone.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.900
LISA DESJARDINS: If you have a
smartphone -- and two-thirds of
us in America do, according

37:15.900 --> 37:22.373
to the Pew Research Center --
you are already on the radar for
most 2016 campaigns. That's

37:22.373 --> 37:26.811
because campaigns left and right
are now amassing more and more
data about voters, and they're

37:26.811 --> 37:30.715
trying to influence you this
time around using this.

37:30.715 --> 37:34.185
STEPHANIE CUTTER, Former Obama
Deputy Campaign Manager: The
ability for campaigns now to

37:34.185 --> 37:41.493
target individuals on their
mobiles with customized,
individualized advertising, it's
remarkable.

37:41.493 --> 37:45.864
LISA DESJARDINS: That's
Stephanie Cutter. You may
recognize her as a former
spokeswoman

37:45.864 --> 37:55.707
for President Obama. In 2012,
she and team Obama won a
national campaign by
dramatically

37:55.707 --> 38:00.311
expanding their data operation,
turning out troves of voters by
transforming millions

38:00.311 --> 38:07.552
of pieces of their personal
data into a targeted campaign.

38:07.552 --> 38:13.291
Now everyone is upping their
digital game, including super
PACs. Traditional on-stage

38:13.291 --> 38:17.695
debates have given way to
digital face-offs on Twitter.

38:17.695 --> 38:22.834
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Yes, they broke the
law, but it's not a felony.

38:22.834 --> 38:28.640
LISA DESJARDINS: And Instagram.
Two weeks ago, Donald Trump's
Instagram feed contained

38:28.640 --> 38:33.978
three anti-Bush attack ads. How
did he respond? Bush put up a
YouTube video, of course,
questioning

38:33.978 --> 38:34.913
Trump's GOP loyalty.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.147
QUESTION: Then why are
you a Republican?

38:36.147 --> 38:39.817
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I have no idea.

38:39.817 --> 38:45.823
LISA DESJARDINS: But the bigger
digital battle is quieter at
places like Precision Strategies

38:45.823 --> 38:51.029
in Washington, founded by some
Obama veterans. The firm is
working now for the Clinton
campaign.

38:51.029 --> 38:56.434
And their next cyber-land of
opportunity is the cell phone.

38:56.434 --> 39:01.873
The number of Americans with
smartphones has leapt by an
estimated 660 million people in

39:01.873 --> 39:07.879
just the three years since the
2012 election to roughly 200
million now. About as many

39:07.879 --> 39:13.384
Americans are on Facebook. Of
course, that includes some kids
not old enough to vote,

39:13.384 --> 39:17.956
but it is still a voter data
gold mine, and campaigns are
working to connect that Facebook

39:17.956 --> 39:23.361
information to public
information about how often you
vote and to your cell phone, all

39:23.361 --> 39:28.499
that with the goal of targeting
you at the right time with the
right ad.

39:28.499 --> 39:32.870
This is one reason campaign Web
sites all ask, first thing, for
your e-mail.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.708
STEPHANIE CUTTER: If somebody
signs up on your Web site to get
information from your

39:36.708 --> 39:41.045
campaign, that's easily
matchable to Facebook, to
Twitter and a whole host of
other platforms.

39:41.045 --> 39:47.485
So your complete online identity
can quickly be known to the
campaign. And they can
communicate

39:47.485 --> 39:51.723
with you through all these
different touch points, with
your permission, of course.

39:51.723 --> 39:56.160
LISA DESJARDINS: In this,
Facebook is critical. Last
month, the company sponsored a
Republican

39:56.160 --> 40:01.466
debate and set up this lounge
for reporters. Recently, the
company made it easier to track

40:01.466 --> 40:07.071
some voter information, opening
up its huge universe of data for
campaigns to exploit.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.741
ANDY STONE, Policy
Communications Manager,
Facebook: There are now 193
million people

40:09.741 --> 40:13.311
on the platform every month.
That's more than there are
registered voters in this
country.

40:13.311 --> 40:17.448
So, there's a whole team of
people at Facebook that work
with not only campaigns, but
also

40:17.448 --> 40:21.786
elected officials, advocacy
organizations, to help them use
the platform as effectively

40:21.786 --> 40:24.289
as they possibly can to reach
the people that they are trying
to reach.

40:24.289 --> 40:27.191
LISA DESJARDINS: But
Facebook has competition.

40:27.191 --> 40:30.295
NICK SCHAPER, President, Engage:
A lot of folks are talking about
Snapshot.

40:30.295 --> 40:35.800
LISA DESJARDINS: Nick Schaper
runs the Republican-leaning
strategy firm Engage. He's
talking about Snapchat,

40:35.800 --> 40:40.872
an app is changing cell phone
use, especially for young
people. Don't understand it?

40:40.872 --> 40:45.610
This is how Snapchat works,
quick videos like this one that
you personalize with text.

40:45.610 --> 40:53.418
Then the videos or photos
disappear, either immediately or
the next day. The idea has

40:53.418 --> 40:59.924
caught fire. Now Snapchat has
launched a news division,
curating the best videos and
photos

40:59.924 --> 41:05.463
from people around the country
into one story that can get
millions of views. Take the
Republican

41:05.463 --> 41:10.101
debate in August. Twice as many
18-to-24-year-olds watched that
debate through Snapchat than

41:10.101 --> 41:12.136
on TV.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.907
NICK SCHAPER: It's not only
being able to connect with the
younger generation, but in

41:15.907 --> 41:21.245
using just a new medium that
gives them some new advertising
opportunities and new marketing

41:21.245 --> 41:26.684
opportunities and paid promotion
opportunities to reach voters,
is going to be pretty powerful.

41:26.684 --> 41:30.855
LISA DESJARDINS: Campaigns are
racing to harness that power. In
the meantime, voters, watch

41:30.855 --> 41:34.092
your smartphones.

41:34.092 --> 41:44.736
Lisa Desjardins, "PBS
NewsHour," Washington.

41:44.736 --> 41:52.643
HARI SREENIVASAN: Los Angeles'
cultural scene is about to get a
big new showcase for
contemporary

41:52.643 --> 41:57.181
art. A new museum opens this
weekend featuring the work of
major artists from the past six

41:57.181 --> 42:01.819
decades, all from the private
collection of a longtime arts
patron.

42:01.819 --> 42:05.356
Jeffrey Brown takes us
there for a preview.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.861
JEFFREY BROWN: Billionaire art
collector Eli Broad still
remembers how he managed to
acquire

42:09.861 --> 42:13.898
this early painting by modern
master Roy Lichtenstein.

42:13.898 --> 42:20.071
ELI BROAD, Art Collector: A
Parisian collector wanted a lot
of money for it. I wasn't going

42:20.071 --> 42:25.143
to pay that. So what I did is, I
wrote a check for X-million
dollars and said, you could

42:25.143 --> 42:27.845
take the check, send me
the art, or tear it up.

42:27.845 --> 42:29.080
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

42:29.080 --> 42:32.116
ELI BROAD: And we ended
up with the art.

42:32.116 --> 42:37.622
JEFFREY BROWN: Not something
that most of us can do, but Eli
Broad can and has for more

42:37.622 --> 42:43.261
than four decades. The results
can now be seen in the brand-new
$140 million Broad MDNM Museum

42:43.261 --> 42:46.898
in Los Angeles.

42:46.898 --> 42:51.936
Designed by the firm of Diller
Scofidio and Renfro, it features
an outer honeycomb veil

42:51.936 --> 42:57.475
that allows natural light to
filter in, a floor for storage
of art works that visitors

42:57.475 --> 43:03.948
can peer into, and 30 galleries
filled with big names in modern
and contemporary art,

43:03.948 --> 43:10.888
Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Kara
Walker, Jeff Koons, and many
others, including Jasper Johns.

43:10.888 --> 43:13.558
A number of these, I
understand, were in your home.

43:13.558 --> 43:14.892
ELI BROAD: They were indeed.

43:14.892 --> 43:17.128
WOMAN: Sorry about that.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.264
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, why that
-- why do you make that face?

43:20.264 --> 43:26.137
ELI BROAD: Well, I decided we
want the best work to be shown
in public, so we stripped

43:26.137 --> 43:33.411
a lot of work off our walls. I
want it seen by the largest
audience possible.

43:33.411 --> 43:37.815
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a long way
from Eli Broad's modest
childhood home in Detroit,
where, he

43:37.815 --> 43:41.652
says, there was no
art on the walls.

43:41.652 --> 43:47.158
The son of Jewish Lithuanian
immigrants, Broad graduated from
Michigan State University,

43:47.158 --> 43:52.463
married Edye Lawson, and started
a business building tract homes
in the suburbs of Detroit.

43:52.463 --> 43:58.903
It grew into KB Homes, one of
the nation's largest
homebuilders. He later created
SunAmerica,

43:58.903 --> 44:03.741
a large investment company. It
all propelled Broad onto the
Forbes list of wealthiest people

44:03.741 --> 44:08.746
in the world. Last year, his net
worth was estimated at over $7
billion.

44:08.746 --> 44:14.385
He is a major philanthropist in
education and medicine, as well
as the arts, one known

44:14.385 --> 44:18.789
for keeping a strong, even
controlling hand in his various
projects.

44:18.789 --> 44:23.060
ELI BROAD: We pledged to give 75
percent of our wealth away
during our lifetime.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.130
JEFFREY BROWN: And you're sort
of smiling as you say that. Do
you -- is it fun, a fun

44:26.130 --> 44:29.300
thing to do, to give it away?

44:29.300 --> 44:33.137
ELI BROAD: I see it as
investment, rather than just
charity.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.806
JEFFREY BROWN: What's the
investment? What do you mean,
investment in what?

44:35.806 --> 44:43.281
ELI BROAD: You want a return in
education. You want to see
scientific and medical research

44:43.281 --> 44:45.816
breakthroughs. And the art, you
want to share it with the
broadest possible public to get

44:45.816 --> 44:49.787
more people interested in art.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.355
JOANNE HEYLER, Director/Chief
Curator, Broad Museum: This is a
work by Los Angeles artist

44:51.355 --> 44:53.691
Robert Therrien.

44:53.691 --> 44:59.030
JEFFREY BROWN: The Broads began
collecting art in the 1970s, and
for the last 26 years

44:59.030 --> 45:02.867
have relied on the professional
advice of curator Joanne Heyler,
who will now serve

45:02.867 --> 45:05.937
as director of the new museum.

45:05.937 --> 45:08.806
She showed me one of the more
whimsical pieces in the
collection.

45:08.806 --> 45:14.645
So, under the table, it's a
child's-eye view or something?

45:14.645 --> 45:19.417
JOANNE HEYLER: It does feel like
a child's-eye view, an almost
"Alice in Wonderland"
experience.

45:19.417 --> 45:24.855
JEFFREY BROWN: Over time, the
Broads acquired 2,000 works of
art, adding a new piece almost

45:24.855 --> 45:30.061
every week. And the collection
has long functioned as a kind of
lending library, with some 8,000

45:30.061 --> 45:34.165
loans to more than 500
art institutions.

45:34.165 --> 45:39.136
Heyler says it's been rapid-fire
buying, but always with an eye
toward a public mission.

45:39.136 --> 45:42.673
JOANNE HEYLER: We're deep
investors in an artist's work,
so we really want to know what

45:42.673 --> 45:44.842
we're getting into when we buy.

45:44.842 --> 45:48.946
JEFFREY BROWN: Investors in the
sense of -- not as in buying it
to make money, but...

45:48.946 --> 45:52.850
JOANNE HEYLER: Investors in the
sense of art history, investors
in the sense of trying

45:52.850 --> 45:56.754
to promote their work to the
public, not in any financial
sense.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.757
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you feel
that's a big role, to be part of
art history? Is it that grand,

45:59.757 --> 46:02.393
in a sense?

46:02.393 --> 46:07.298
JOANNE HEYLER: Well, you shoot
for that. You aspire for that.
And, again, when you're in

46:07.298 --> 46:09.967
the realm of contemporary art,
you can't be sure. And you have
to like not being sure

46:09.967 --> 46:11.268
all the time.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.438
MARK BRADFORD, Artist: I
like these snap lines.

46:14.438 --> 46:19.410
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
artists the Broads have
collected in depth is Mark
Bradford,

46:19.410 --> 46:26.083
who we visited in his huge
studio in an industrial part of
South Los Angeles. His Scorched
Earth

46:26.083 --> 46:29.420
painting, about the aftermath of
the L.A. riots, is featured in
the inaugural exhibit

46:29.420 --> 46:32.189
at the museum.

46:32.189 --> 46:36.661
As a young artist just out of
grad school, Bradford said, he'd
heard of the Broads, but:

46:36.661 --> 46:42.233
MARK BRADFORD: It was all just
folklore to me, the Broads, the
Broad collection.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.869
JEFFREY BROWN: You didn't
know what that meant.

46:44.869 --> 46:46.837
MARK BRADFORD: I didn't know. I
probably -- probably, the first
time said the Broad, I probably

46:46.837 --> 46:48.839
said the Broad.

46:48.839 --> 46:52.276
JEFFREY BROWN: Years later, he
says this of the Broads'
influence:

46:52.276 --> 46:57.214
MARK BRADFORD: I think it's
important when collectors
collect in depth of an artist,

46:57.214 --> 47:01.085
because you don't feel like
they're just doing baseball
cards: I have one of this and
one

47:01.085 --> 47:05.322
of this and one of this. You
really feel like they're
committed to your work over the
long

47:05.322 --> 47:08.592
period. And that, for me, means
something, because you can see
your growth in the work.

47:08.592 --> 47:08.959
(CROSSTALK)

47:08.959 --> 47:10.961
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really?

47:10.961 --> 47:13.998
MARK BRADFORD: Sure. You go, oh,
that was good, or, whoa, I'm a
little bit better. Oh.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.700
But you can see that...

47:15.700 --> 47:16.567
JEFFREY BROWN: Just
looking in one place.

47:16.567 --> 47:17.501
MARK BRADFORD: One place.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.104
JEFFREY BROWN: In
his collection.

47:20.104 --> 47:24.542
L.A. Times art critic
Christopher Knight applauds that
kind of long-term commitment,
but wishes

47:24.542 --> 47:28.813
the overall collection reached
beyond so-called blue-chip art
and deeper into what's been

47:28.813 --> 47:31.649
produced in Los Angeles.

47:31.649 --> 47:34.318
CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, Art Critic,
The Los Angeles Times: The
primary limitation of the
collection

47:34.318 --> 47:42.259
is that it's a market-driven
collection, which is a very
narrow sliver of the very active

47:42.259 --> 47:47.965
art world of the last 30 years.
And I wish it had a greater
representation of art that

47:47.965 --> 47:51.435
has been produced
in Los Angeles.

47:51.435 --> 47:58.175
There is nowhere to go where one
can see the evolution of the
development of art in Los

47:58.175 --> 48:01.278
Angeles. There isn't one.
And there should be.

48:01.278 --> 48:06.217
JEFFREY BROWN: Eli Broad,
though, is obsessed with
developing L.A. as a leading
capital

48:06.217 --> 48:11.322
of the art world. The new
building is part of an arts
district he's helped create,
stretching

48:11.322 --> 48:15.760
along Grand Avenue in downtown
Los Angeles, and including
Disney Concert Hall and the

48:15.760 --> 48:18.429
Museum of Contemporary Art.

48:18.429 --> 48:19.597
What was the idea
that you wanted to...

48:19.597 --> 48:21.232
(CROSSTALK)

48:21.232 --> 48:25.469
ELI BROAD: The ideal one is to
create a vibrant center for a
region of 14 million people.

48:25.469 --> 48:31.609
And I consider this to be the
regional cultural and civic
center for the region of 14
million

48:31.609 --> 48:32.443
people.

48:32.443 --> 48:33.611
JEFFREY BROWN: Which
it didn't have?

48:33.611 --> 48:35.946
ELI BROAD: It did
not have before.

48:35.946 --> 48:40.184
JEFFREY BROWN: Whether the new
Broad helps further that vision
for downtown is one of

48:40.184 --> 48:43.854
the big question marks as
it opens this weekend.

48:43.854 --> 48:52.696
From Los Angeles, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

48:52.696 --> 49:01.338
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
regular feature Brief But
Spectacular.

49:01.338 --> 49:06.177
Tonight, author and comedian
Baratunde Thurston on using
humor to educate and skewer
racism

49:06.177 --> 49:08.479
with satire.

49:08.479 --> 49:13.551
BARATUNDE THURSTON,
Author/Comedian: When you are
the black friend in your circle
of

49:13.551 --> 49:16.620
people, that means you're the
one black person that these
friends have, you're kind of
like

49:16.620 --> 49:21.192
a double agent, and you help
prevent all-out thermonuclear
war.

49:21.192 --> 49:26.197
Nailed it.

49:26.197 --> 49:35.639
I grew up in the Columbia
Heights neighborhood of
Washington, D.C., before it was
flooded

49:35.639 --> 49:41.412
by white people. I was raised by
my mother alone. My father was
killed when I was 7 or

49:41.412 --> 49:45.850
8 years old. And my mom worked
for the government, no college
degree, very self-taught, the
most

49:45.850 --> 49:49.553
resourceful and intelligent
person I have ever known.

49:49.553 --> 49:55.125
In college, I started writing a
satirical e-mail newsletter. And
I got very frustrated

49:55.125 --> 50:02.199
that my peers at Harvard
University didn't know anything
about what was going on in the

50:02.199 --> 50:06.704
world. So, I'm like, yes, we're
paying 38 bagillion dollars a
second to be here. You

50:06.704 --> 50:10.608
should know what's going on in
Sri Lanka. And I took it upon
myself to educate my peers

50:10.608 --> 50:14.044
with less stridency
and more hilarity.

50:14.044 --> 50:19.650
I served at The Onion for about
five years as political editor
and director of digital

50:19.650 --> 50:24.021
strategy. And for the most part,
I was the black people at The
Onion. The Onion does

50:24.021 --> 50:28.492
a lot of great photo art, so I
played the part of a lot of
other black people in the

50:28.492 --> 50:33.130
Photoshop job. I was the mayor
of Detroit. I was all three
Supremes. I was President

50:33.130 --> 50:37.301
Obama's hand, and I wrote, like,
executive orders with that hand.
It was powerful.

50:37.301 --> 50:41.472
The book "How to Be Black" is
mostly a memoir, and it's
peppered with satirical lessons
that

50:41.472 --> 50:45.309
I have learned along the way,
how to be the black employee,
how to be the black friend,

50:45.309 --> 50:47.645
how to be the next
black president.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.414
If a white person is holding a
book called "How to Be Black,"
they're like, oh, you poor

50:50.414 --> 50:54.551
thing. Like, you think a book is
going to change this for you?
But if a black person

50:54.551 --> 50:57.421
is holding it, they're like, oh,
you poor thing. Do you need a
refresher course? And

50:57.421 --> 51:01.158
so I'm glad to have offered
that into the world.

51:01.158 --> 51:05.162
Racism is an absurd act in our
history as well. And so,
sometimes, we have got to come

51:05.162 --> 51:10.100
at it sideways, come at it
comedically to try to move
forward politically.

51:10.100 --> 51:19.543
My name is Baratunde Thurston.
This is my Brief But Spectacular
take on how to be black.

51:19.543 --> 51:32.256
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online right now: An
outdoor lab devoted to measuring

51:32.256 --> 51:38.495
the effects of sea level rise
shows troubling results, the
accelerated poisoning of
freshwater

51:38.495 --> 51:43.167
wetlands that keep our water
clean. Read more about the wild
side of sea level rise on our

51:43.167 --> 51:46.270
Science page.

51:46.270 --> 51:51.575
And on our World page, we take
you around the globe in five
questions. Test your news

51:51.575 --> 51:59.450
knowledge with our new weekly
quiz. All that and more is on
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:59.450 --> 52:02.753
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

52:02.753 --> 52:05.289
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.658
Here's a preview:

52:07.658 --> 52:12.563
GWEN IFILL: Now, with two
debates under their belts, we
take a look at where the
Republican

52:12.563 --> 52:18.035
candidates go from here. Does
Donald Trump still ride high?
Can Carly Fiorina capitalize

52:18.035 --> 52:22.740
on a strong night? Can Jeb Bush
and Scott Walker bounce back?

52:22.740 --> 52:26.143
That's tonight on
"Washington Week" -- Hari.

52:26.143 --> 52:31.615
HARI SREENIVASAN: On "PBS
NewsHour Weekend" Saturday, we
begin a six-part series, "Time

52:31.615 --> 52:35.119
for School," about the fight for
education around the world.

52:35.119 --> 52:38.355
We begin with a
story from Kenya.

52:38.355 --> 52:44.962
NARRATOR: Joab Onyando's (ph)
family could never afford
tuition for school, until 2003,

52:44.962 --> 52:48.632
when Kenya makes primary school
free for the first time in
nearly 30 years.

52:48.632 --> 52:51.535
MAN: Good morning, school.

52:51.535 --> 52:55.172
STUDENTS: Good morning.

52:55.172 --> 53:02.546
NARRATOR: More than a million
new students flood the system.
Joab (ph) is 10 and his

53:02.546 --> 53:07.051
brother Gerald (ph) is 7 when
they begin first grade, walking
to school each day through

53:07.051 --> 53:21.298
the sprawling Nairobi slum
they call home, Kibera. Their

53:21.298 --> 53:25.769
class has 74 students
and one teacher.

53:25.769 --> 53:29.540
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
tomorrow night on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend."

53:29.540 --> 53:33.143
And we will be back right here
on Monday with a look at who is
Pope Francis ahead of his

53:33.143 --> 53:35.746
first U.S. visit.

53:35.746 --> 53:37.214
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:37.214 --> 53:37.915
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
