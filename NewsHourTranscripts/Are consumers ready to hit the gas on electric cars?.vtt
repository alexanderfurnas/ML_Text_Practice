JUDY WOODRUFF: Now:
Electric cars, are they
the ride of the future?

00:04.900 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their potential to revolutionize
the road is once again
grabbing headlines, as some

00:09.266 --> 00:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
companies ramp up
production plans.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham breaks down
the realities of the technology
and the market for electric

00:16.433 --> 00:18.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vehicles.

00:18.533 --> 00:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He recorded this earlier for our
weekly segment on the Leading
Edge of science and technology.

00:22.333 --> 00:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The knock on
electric cars has always been
that they're a pricey, niche

00:26.900 --> 00:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
product that only a
handful of people would
want or could afford.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that reputation is
starting to crumble, and fast.

00:33.433 --> 00:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The electric car maker Tesla,
which already has a bigger
market value than General Motors

00:37.666 --> 00:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Ford, will soon
be delivering its
mid-priced Model 3 car.

00:42.466 --> 00:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Volvo just announced that,
in two years, all of its cars
will be hybrids or electric.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And some major U.S.
manufacturers have
proven electric vehicles
available right now.

00:52.433 --> 00:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, are electric vehicles
ready to go mainstream?

00:55.633 --> 00:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NPR's Sonari Glinton has
been covering the story.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he joins me now.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

00:59.933 --> 01:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON, NPR:
It's good to be here.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, electric
car advocates have been saying
for decades that these cars

01:06.200 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are the future.

01:07.733 --> 01:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why has it taken them this long
to get to where they are today?

01:10.500 --> 01:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: I would say low
gas prices, the pickup truck,
and America's sort of dependency

01:19.466 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the status quo.

01:21.566 --> 01:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you look at an electric
car, if you drive one -- I used
to have a plug-in hybrid -- and

01:28.400 --> 01:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to a point where I
never went to the gas station,
and I never thought...

01:31.533 --> 01:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
got to be a great feeling.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Yes, and
I never -- yes, exactly.

01:35.033 --> 01:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- when I switched --
I'm one of the few people to
switch, you know, from electric

01:39.400 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a gas-powered car.

01:41.866 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I went to a gas-powered
car, it's a two-seater
convertible, so like
that's the reason I did

01:46.566 --> 01:48.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:48.566 --> 01:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I cannot imagine getting
-- I can't imagine not
having that convenience.

01:55.533 --> 01:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You always start the
day with a full tank.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a simpler drivetrain,
so it's easier to fix.

02:02.833 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has fewer problems.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's quiet like a luxury car.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is, is that
the car companies, right,
are building trucks that...

02:11.633 --> 02:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
That the market wants.

02:14.433 --> 02:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON:
Desperately wants.

02:16.133 --> 02:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And people are buying
SUVs way more now than
they're buying cars.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The tipping point was
reached a few years ago.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we're at about 60
-- depending on what month,
about 60/40 SUVs to cars.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's partially because
we're all realizing, like,
I want to sit up higher.

02:33.366 --> 02:34.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I want to...

02:34.366 --> 02:36.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:36.433 --> 02:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And if the
gas prices aren't killing you,
there's no reason to go into

02:37.566 --> 02:38.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an electric.

02:38.566 --> 02:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Yes.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, to be
clear, there are a lot of
hurdles for electric cars.

02:43.766 --> 02:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, mainly, it's the battery.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not necessarily figuring
out how to move the car.

02:49.233 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's getting a lighter,
cheaper battery is what's
at the crux of this.

02:55.733 --> 02:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the auto industry knows that
that's where it's going, right?

02:58.766 --> 03:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Wall Street and customers
say, well, we like those F-150s,
we like those Chevy Silverados

03:05.300 --> 03:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and those Dodge Rams, and
we're buying a lot of them.

03:08.033 --> 03:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're hugely, hugely
profitable, while electric car
profits are, A, they're about

03:14.200 --> 03:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
3.5 -- the volume
of electric cars...

03:17.433 --> 03:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A tiny
sliver of the market.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: Tiny,
like less than 4 percent.

03:21.066 --> 03:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's been stagnant
for a few years because
of those gas prices.

03:26.066 --> 03:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of things.

03:28.233 --> 03:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for the most part, in
many places in the country --
I live in California, where

03:32.333 --> 03:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are many, many charging
stations and there's rebates
and things like that that

03:36.800 --> 03:38.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you can get.

03:38.866 --> 03:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you're in the middle
of the country, the word
may not have gotten to you.

03:41.666 --> 03:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, there are
so many hurdles.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
incentives just aren't there.

03:46.366 --> 03:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: The
incentives aren't there.

03:48.333 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we haven't educated the
consumer about the difference.

03:52.766 --> 03:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you -- when people get into
electric cars, they love them.

03:56.533 --> 03:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they use them in their
lives, they love them.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you look at the marketing
and you look at the car
companies, and your Super Bowl

04:03.166 --> 04:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-time commercial isn't
necessarily, you know,
the latest, lightest,
most fuel-sipping

04:10.666 --> 04:11.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vehicle.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, it's the big trucks
and those things.

04:13.366 --> 04:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, right now, that's
important in the short term.

04:16.466 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But every carmaker
understands that
electrification and autonomy
are definitely the future.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're not the future
like 30 years from now.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the future
really, really soon.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So
there are no Kodaks among
the car manufacturers.

04:29.633 --> 04:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They get that electric is
the future, but they're still
making a lot of money off big,

04:33.033 --> 04:34.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heavy trucks.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And is there an
incompatibility there?

04:36.466 --> 04:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you make electric cars
and design and develop and
push them out at the same time

04:40.666 --> 04:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you're making big,
heavy, gas-guzzling trucks?

04:43.233 --> 04:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: Well, you can
make the argument that companies
like Ford or Chevy are already

04:47.333 --> 04:49.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing that.

04:49.433 --> 04:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chevy has the Volt, which
does what the Tesla Model
3 says it's going to do.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It goes over 200
miles per charge.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's under $40,000, which
is within range of the
average American consumer.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they build --
some months, the Silverado
is really, really a
gangbuster for that company.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when we talk to executives,
you hear the pressure to keep
those trucks going, to pump

05:16.133 --> 05:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out those F-150 profits.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, studies show that,
for Ford, the F-150 is as much
as 90 percent sometimes of

05:26.700 --> 05:27.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profitability.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wow.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: So, you
look at the F-150...

05:30.400 --> 05:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's a
hard thing to argue against.

05:31.633 --> 05:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Hard
to argue against.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As I
mentioned, Tesla is about
to roll out this Model
3, which, obviously,

05:36.166 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the big question for them is
that they have been selling a
very small number of very pricey

05:40.500 --> 05:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cars.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they want to sell a
lot of these cheaper cars to
appeal to a bigger audience.

05:44.466 --> 05:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the big
challenge for Tesla?

05:45.866 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: All the bets.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For Tesla, it's a bet inside
of a bet inside of a bet.

05:51.833 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're betting that more people
are going to buy electric cars.

05:55.633 --> 06:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're betting on the battery
technology, which Tesla has
one of the biggest factories

06:00.500 --> 06:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the world making batteries.

06:02.533 --> 06:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also bet on how they're
going to change the way people
-- how they sell the cars.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you look all across
the board when it comes to
Tesla, there's this huge bet.

06:13.366 --> 06:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, they make
4,400 cars a month or so.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they're looking to
sell 500,000 Model 3's.

06:19.266 --> 06:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
It's a huge scale-up.

06:21.333 --> 06:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: And, at the
end of the month, Tesla says
it is going to deliver 30 cars

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the buyers, and then
1,900, you know, later on.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The key is, how long are those
customers going to wait for that
car, and how long is it going

06:35.600 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take to get there, and they
are going to be able to scale
up, and can they keep that

06:40.000 --> 06:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quality that they were known for
when they were selling 4,400?

06:44.033 --> 06:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what the answer
to those things are, but I do
know that is going to be really

06:48.033 --> 06:49.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hard.

06:49.466 --> 06:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: NPR's Sonari
Glinton, thanks so much.

06:50.700 --> 06:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON:
Always a pleasure.
