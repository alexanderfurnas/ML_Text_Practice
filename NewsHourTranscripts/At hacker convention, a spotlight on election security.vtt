00:34.933 --> 00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE KIND OF INTERESTED.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT A MACHINE THAT IS IN

00:38.033 --> 00:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE TODAY BUT IT WAS JUST A FEW

00:39.833 --> 00:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO.

00:41.466 --> 00:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH AND IT WAS IN USE FOR

00:42.633 --> 00:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AND DEFINITELY HACKABLE

00:44.033 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR YEARS.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS THE THING THAT REALLY

00:47.533 --> 00:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION JUST SITTING

00:49.100 --> 00:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE NEXT TO A GUY WITH A

00:50.466 --> 00:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAPTOP WHO'S CONNECTING TO A

00:52.433 --> 00:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINE THAT IS STATING

00:54.666 --> 00:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT WAS USED IN FAIRFAX

00:56.500 --> 00:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTY IN 2014, CONNECTS TO IT

00:58.833 --> 01:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIRELESSLY AND TAKES COMPLETE

01:00.166 --> 01:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROL OF IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF

01:01.000 --> 01:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ME.

01:02.433 --> 01:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THERE'S BEEN SO

01:03.733 --> 01:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH TALK ABOUT THE RUSSIANS AND

01:04.900 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE

01:05.966 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS, AND REPEATEDLY THE

01:07.100 --> 01:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

01:08.200 --> 01:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER AGENCIES SAYS THERE

01:09.433 --> 01:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEREN'T ANY VOTES MANIPULATED

01:10.700 --> 01:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HACK THAT WAS JUST

01:13.700 --> 01:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMONSTRATED HERE, WHAT IS THE

01:14.866 --> 01:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE IT COULD

01:15.933 --> 01:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO?

01:17.566 --> 01:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT COULD HAVE ALTERED THE

01:18.833 --> 01:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTES.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO

01:21.133 --> 01:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ONE VOTING MACHINE, YOU

01:23.000 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:25.733 --> 01:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDETECTABLE AFTER IT HAPPENED.

01:27.866 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY CONCERNS

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THIS ONE PARTICULAR

01:31.000 --> 01:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MACHINE.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE BROADER PICTURE

01:33.366 --> 01:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO WORRY

01:36.000 --> 01:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WITH VOTING MACHINE

01:37.900 --> 01:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY IS ONLY BECOMING CLEAR

01:39.433 --> 01:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I THINK FOR A WHILE

01:42.766 --> 01:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE

01:44.066 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEGRITY OF JUST THESE DEVICES.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, TEN YEARS AGO WE HAD

01:47.966 --> 01:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUDITS OF VOTING MACHINES AND

01:49.233 --> 01:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:50.233 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WITH WHAT HAPPENED LAST

01:52.533 --> 01:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, THE WHOLE SCENARIO OF WHAT

01:55.733 --> 01:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE HACKED AND HOW IT COULD

01:57.133 --> 01:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE HACKED AND THE CONCEPT OF THE

01:59.266 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NETWORK BEING ATTACKED, PEOPLE

02:02.100 --> 02:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE RETHINKING VOTING MACHINE

02:03.200 --> 02:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY RIGHT NOW.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT WAS

02:05.500 --> 02:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTRIGUING IS THAT THIS VOTING

02:07.766 --> 02:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MACHINE WAS USED IN 2014 BUT THE

02:09.666 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HACKER LOOKS LIKE THEY FOUND A

02:11.433 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLE THAT WAS... MICROSOFT

02:13.366 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUED A PATCH FOR THAT YEARS

02:14.766 --> 02:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, AND THIS... I MEAN,

02:17.433 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MACHINE, IT'S CALLED A

02:19.033 --> 02:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WINVOTE MACHINE, IT'S WIDELY

02:20.733 --> 02:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDERED TO BE THE WORST

02:22.200 --> 02:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINE EVER.

02:24.066 --> 02:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE FACT THAT IT... THAT THIS

02:26.833 --> 02:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED, TO PEOPLE THAT

02:28.066 --> 02:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW THIS, IS NOT SURPRISING.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT THESE

02:31.133 --> 02:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINES WERE

02:32.066 --> 02:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VULNERABLE, BUT IT'S HARD TO

02:33.400 --> 02:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET ACCESS TO THEM.

02:34.766 --> 02:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THE ACT OF ACTUALLY

02:36.133 --> 02:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEING SOMEBODY DO IT IS PRETTY

02:37.566 --> 02:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RARE.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE STRENGTH

02:40.766 --> 02:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE WEAKNESS OF OUR ENTIRE

02:42.166 --> 02:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT THERE

02:43.800 --> 02:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T ANY UNIFORMITY IN THE

02:45.366 --> 02:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF MACHINES THAT EXIST IN

02:46.833 --> 02:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY JURISDICTION ALL OVER THE

02:48.266 --> 02:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY AND THERE'S ALSO NO

02:50.433 --> 02:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTRAL I.T. STAFF THAT SAYS,

02:51.933 --> 02:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"OKAY, HERE'S THE UPDATE, A

02:53.600 --> 02:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOFTWARE PATCH THAT'S GOING TO

02:55.166 --> 02:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO OUT TO EVERYTHING AT THE

02:56.466 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME TIME, OR THAT A HACKER

02:58.100 --> 02:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD GET INTO THAT ONE CENTRAL

02:59.466 --> 03:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM AND HACK EVERYTHING AT

03:00.600 --> 03:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME TIME.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE

03:03.733 --> 03:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS THAT

03:05.133 --> 03:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR SYSTEMS WERE SO DIVERSE

03:06.300 --> 03:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO

03:07.566 --> 03:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPROMISE THEM IN A WIDESPREAD

03:08.633 --> 03:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE LEARNING

03:10.966 --> 03:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE 2016 EFFORT, THE FACT

03:13.433 --> 03:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE WERE SO MANY STATES

03:14.766 --> 03:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECTED, THESE WEREN'T VOTING

03:16.400 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MACHINES, THESE WERE THE

03:18.733 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MACHINES THAT KEEP TRACK OF THE

03:21.100 --> 03:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTERED VOTERS, BUT THE FACT

03:24.233 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REMOTELY, PEOPLE WERE ABLE

03:25.766 --> 03:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ACCESS COUNTY SYSTEMS LIKE

03:27.500 --> 03:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT MIGHT

03:29.966 --> 03:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE... WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED

03:31.333 --> 03:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THAT IS STILL A QUESTION

03:32.533 --> 03:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THE WHOLE NETWORK OF

03:36.933 --> 03:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINES AND PEOPLE ARE

03:38.766 --> 03:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY REEVALUATING THIS

03:40.733 --> 03:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION OF HOW SUSCEPTIBLE THE

03:44.033 --> 03:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES IS TO SORT OF A

03:45.533 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
