We are just treading water if
all we're doing

00:36.603 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is saving someone's life right
now.

00:38.538 --> 00:42.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also know that we have to get

second part, which is access to
long-term

00:42.943 --> 00:44.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

00:44.311 --> 00:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is looking
to move ahead, in the wake of
his address

01:02.162 --> 01:03.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Congress.

01:03.964 --> 01:08.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He won praise today from
Republicans, while
Democrats warned that his more
moderate sound

01:08.769 --> 01:11.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
belies his real intentions.

01:11.171 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street's reaction to the
president's
business-friendly tone was
euphoric.

01:15.575 --> 01:21.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
shot up 300
points to close above 21000 for
the first

01:21.815 --> 01:22.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

citizens from Iraq.

01:38.298 --> 01:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had been one of seven nations
included
in the initial ban that's still
tied up in

01:42.135 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal court.

01:44.004 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press also
reports Syrian refugees
will no longer be barred
indefinitely under

01:48.542 --> 01:50.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

01:50.544 --> 01:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it drops any explicit
exception for Christian
and other religious minorities
in Muslim nations.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

across part
of the Midwest last night,
killing three people

02:04.658 --> 02:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and damaging more than 100
homes.

02:06.927 --> 02:11.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The National Weather Service
says it had reports
of more than 20 twisters.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the worst damage came in
Illinois

02:14.334 --> 02:18.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, Illinois Governor

got to count
our blessings.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This could have been way worse.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The warnings systems worked
well.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People were notified.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's wonderful the way the
residents in
the community helped each other.

02:29.483 --> 02:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They got to elderly residents,
gave them a
warning that tornadoes were
coming.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People got into their basements.

02:35.589 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Forecasters say
about 95 million
people are in the path of the
same storm system

02:40.761 --> 02:42.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as it moves east.

02:42.562 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, a
staggering
statistic out of Chicago: The
Windy City had

02:46.233 --> 02:53.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no measurable snow during
January and February
for the first time in 146 years,
while, in

02:53.106 --> 02:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, there's been so much
snow, that
a five-year-long drought may
finally be over.

02:58.412 --> 03:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crews already measured the
state's snowpack
once, and did so again today,
after one of

03:03.050 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
California's wettest winters on
record.

03:05.419 --> 03:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
twin Taliban
bombings, and a lengthy
shoot-out, killed

03:10.357 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least 16 people in the
capital, Kabul.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 100 others were
wounded.

03:15.529 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the first attack, a suicide
car bomber
targeted a police station,
touching off a

03:20.367 --> 03:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gun battle that lasted hours.

03:22.402 --> 03:28.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, an attacker on foot blew
himself up
outside the Afghan intelligence
service.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The United
States today
delivered a sharp rebuke to the
U.N. Human

03:31.778 --> 03:33.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rights Council over Israel.

03:33.947 --> 03:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington has long argued the
47-nation body
unjustly focuses on Israel's
treatment of

03:39.920 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Palestinians.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin
Barclay said
the council has -- quote -- "an
obsession

03:45.358 --> 03:47.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Israel" that undermines the
group's credibility.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State
Assistant: The United States
will oppose any

03:50.363 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort to delegitimize or
isolate Israel,
not just in the HRC, but
wherever it occurs.

03:58.271 --> 04:02.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to human rights,
no country
should be free from scrutiny,
but neither

04:02.943 --> 04:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should any democratic country be
regularly
subjected to unfair, unbalanced
and unfounded

04:09.416 --> 04:11.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bias.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The critique
comes amid
reports the Trump administration
is considering

04:13.887 --> 04:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quitting the council altogether.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the U.S.
Senate easily confirmed Montana
Congressman

04:19.893 --> 04:23.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan Zinke as secretary of the
interior.

04:23.096 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 55-year-old Republican and
former Navy
SEAL has pledged to revitalize
the country's

04:28.368 --> 04:29.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
national parks.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has also said he will resist
efforts to
sell or transfer federal lands.

04:34.241 --> 04:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Danish
toymaker LEGO

five women who were pioneers at
NASA.

04:42.282 --> 04:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The collection will feature
computer scientist
Margaret Hamilton, mathematician
Katherine

04:46.353 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Johnson of "Hidden Figures"

astronomer

04:51.625 --> 04:52.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nancy Grace Roman.

04:52.926 --> 04:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The set will be released later
this year or
early 2018.

04:57.531 --> 05:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President
Trump lays out his vision for
the country

05:01.501 --> 05:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- now, what policies will take
priority?;
a closer look at the
decision-making before

05:07.107 --> 05:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deadly raid in Yemen;
Baltimore's approach
to battling the growing opioid
epidemic; and

05:16.283 --> 05:20.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

05:20.921 --> 05:29.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a longer
look now at
President Trump's speech last
night.

05:29.162 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He promised action on a long
list of priorities,
including Obamacare, the border
wall, public

05:35.468 --> 05:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
works and regulatory reform.

05:37.737 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of it, he did in a more
disciplined,
upbeat way than before.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports on the
day after.

05:45.445 --> 05:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
called in Republican
leaders for a White House lunch,
hoping to

05:50.717 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
build on momentum from last
night's address.

05:52.752 --> 05:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It begins as of now, and we
think we're going

05:57.691 --> 05:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have tremendous success.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vice President
Pence took
that theme on a one-man media
blitz, with

06:03.029 --> 06:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
11 interviews on his public
schedule.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
What the American people saw
last night is

06:07.067 --> 06:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president that I serve with
every day:
broad shoulders, big heart,
reaching out,

06:12.572 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
focusing on the future.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Praise came
from top Republicans
in Congress as well.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: The
president made clear last night
he's ready

06:19.479 --> 06:22.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to work with Congress on
policies that can
actually move us forward.

06:22.649 --> 06:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will find many partners in
Congress excited
to get those things
accomplished.

06:27.554 --> 06:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: High on that
list, repealing
and replacing Obamacare.

06:33.460 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former
Republican
primary rival, lauded Mr. Trump
for his broad

06:39.099 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
outline.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: The
principles he's focused
on are exactly the right
principles: more

06:44.838 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice, more competition, lower
costs, lower
premiums.

06:48.742 --> 06:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Democrats
say there was
no real substance, and they
accuse the president

06:53.747 --> 06:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of misleading the public with
statements like
this:

06:56.716 --> 07:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare premiums
nationwide
have increased by double and
triple digits.

07:03.156 --> 07:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As an example, Arizona went up
116 percent
last year alone.

07:08.128 --> 07:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, while
it's true
Arizona's premiums have gone up
by that amount,

07:13.400 --> 07:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president ignored important
context, that
Arizona is an outlier, with
increases four

07:18.738 --> 07:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
times the national average.

07:21.274 --> 07:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On immigration, some Republicans
say they're
encouraged by Mr. Trump's
comments ahead of

07:26.413 --> 07:30.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his speech that he'd consider a
legal status
for some undocumented
immigrants.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: He's showing
some willingness to embrace a
more practical

07:35.088 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration proposal.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to give him credit for
that.

07:38.625 --> 07:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any time he moves into the land
of practicality,
I want to encourage him, because
that's what

07:43.630 --> 07:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to take to get a bill
passed.

LISA DESJARDINS: But in the
actual speech,
there was no mention of
legalizing undocumented

07:50.070 --> 07:51.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

07:51.838 --> 07:56.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the president spoke of
crimes by
immigrants and his plan to crack
down on the

07:56.109 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
undocumented.

07:58.044 --> 08:02.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: By finally
enforcing our immigration
laws, we will raise wages, help
the unemployed,

08:02.849 --> 08:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
save billions and billions of
dollars, and
make our communities safer for
everyone.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That claim,
too, was challenged.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic Congressman Keith
Ellison of Minnesota
spoke with the "NewsHour" last
night.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:17.464 --> 08:21.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota:
This speech
seems to blame undocumented
immigrants for

08:21.134 --> 08:22.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a crime.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It indicated that clamping down
on immigration
was actually going to increase
wages and make

08:25.972 --> 08:27.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our economy better.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact is, there's no facts
that support
that.

08:30.176 --> 08:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Several of the
presidents
statements were declared
inaccurate by fact-checkers

08:34.381 --> 08:35.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also getting attention, the
generally positive
tone of the speech.

08:38.952 --> 08:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Democrats and
Republicans should
get together and unite for the
good of our

08:43.223 --> 08:46.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country and for the good of the
American people.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

08:47.694 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Democratic
leaders say
it's all a facade.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: You
can't just talk the talk, Mr.
President.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have to walk the walk.

08:56.369 --> 09:04.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on issue after issue after
issue, we haven't
seen anything, or negative
things, for the

09:04.444 --> 09:06.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working class.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
and Congress
both soon will see pressure for
action increase

09:09.949 --> 09:11.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Republicans have said they
want a draft
health care bill by the end of
this month.

09:14.754 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, Trump will be
just one month
away from the end of his first
100 days.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:22.762 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night's
presidential address
relayed an ambitious agenda.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how much of it will take
shape, and does
President Trump have enough
support on Capitol

09:32.806 --> 09:34.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hill to find success?

09:34.941 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to discuss all of
that are Dan
Balz of The Washington Post and
NPR congressional

09:39.746 --> 09:41.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reporter Susan Davis.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dan, I'm going to start with
you.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard Lisa Desjardins
talk about this
was a different tone coming from
the president.

09:49.689 --> 09:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You wrote about that today in
The Washington
Post.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a change from what we
have been hearing.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BALZ, Chief Political
Reporter, The Washington
Post: It was a dramatic change
from what we

09:56.796 --> 09:58.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been hearing.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I looked back to the
inaugural address,
which was described by so many
people as dark

10:02.168 --> 10:06.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or dystopian, the phrase
American carnage
being one that leaped out at
people and has

10:06.973 --> 10:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stayed with people, a very
downbeat view of
things in the state of the
nation, the state

10:12.378 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The substance of last night
wasn't significantly
or materially different from
what he's talked

10:18.485 --> 10:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about all through the campaign
and in his
inaugural address, but the tone
was so much

10:23.189 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talked about unity
repeatedly.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He talked about cooperating with
Democrats.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He talked about a spirit of
American renewal.

10:32.665 --> 10:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was -- it was a speech
that was certainly
aimed at reassuring his
congressional Republican

10:39.172 --> 10:45.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
allies that he will be
presidential, if you
will, going forward, that he
will be serious

10:45.278 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about trying to get these things
done, and
that he will not be seeking to
create diversion

10:52.218 --> 10:54.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and digression and
controversies.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether he's able to stay with
that, we don't
know.

10:56.923 --> 11:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this was only one
speech, and we know
the history of Donald Trump is
that there

11:00.426 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are moments when he -- you know,
he goes in
directions that even his staff
doesn't want.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for that hour in the House
chamber last
night, he was the Donald Trump
that a lot

11:10.003 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of elected officials have wanted
to see for
a long time.

11:13.106 --> 11:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Sue Davis,
it was a confident-sounding
speech, as if he expects these
things to happen.

11:18.378 --> 11:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of what he's done and
what he said
he's going to do so far is
actually taking

11:23.049 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effect?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN DAVIS, NPR: Well, let's
start with the
two top priorities for Congress
that we know,

11:27.787 --> 11:29.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care and taxes.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his remarks in the speech
last night,
it's like they could have been
written by

11:31.958 --> 11:33.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House Speaker Paul Ryan.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the speaker's office has
been saying,
there's no daylight between us.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no daylight between us.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the president is fairly
erratic.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has tweeted different things
on positions
at different times that have
contradicted

11:42.969 --> 11:44.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the speaker.

11:44.837 --> 11:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they saw the speech as
incredibly reassuring,
as Dan said, not only that
they're on the

11:48.541 --> 11:52.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
same page, but that the
president is capable
of using the moment to show
leadership to

11:52.712 --> 11:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of build the case for these
conservative
ideas.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans say health care is
on track.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They expect to see a bill within
weeks, not
months.

12:01.087 --> 12:05.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they saw the president's
speech last night
as an almost tacit endorsement
of this plan

12:05.425 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's emerging from the House.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fight that's going to be
really interesting
is that there is a group of
conservatives

12:11.798 --> 12:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Senate, namely Rand Paul
of Kentucky,
Ted Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee
of Utah, who

12:17.303 --> 12:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are -- could be an immovable
force on this,
who say it is not conservative
enough.

12:21.708 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to see this
really interesting
test of conservatism and the
conservatives

12:26.879 --> 12:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that bedeviled past leaders in
Congress and
Donald Trump, and who is going
to win out

12:31.551 --> 12:33.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this fight.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I talked to Rand Paul today,
and he said,
what has emerged from the House,
he will not

12:36.022 --> 12:37.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote for.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Dan Balz, to
what extent
is the White House prepared for
that kind

12:40.727 --> 12:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of pushback from people in their
own party?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN BALZ: Well, I think they are
prepared.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think they know it's there.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been getting pushback
for some time.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is not only opposition
from conservatives
on Capitol Hill.

12:51.337 --> 12:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is division among the
Republican governors
-- put aside the Democratic
governors -- over

12:56.342 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what to do with Medicaid.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you were a state that
expanded Medicaid,
you have got one view of that.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you didn't, you have got
another view
of that.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are divisions.

13:05.084 --> 13:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the administration today
feels that,
as a result of the speech,
people who have

13:10.089 --> 13:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been reticent to support him or
openly hostile
to what is taking shape in the
House might

13:16.863 --> 13:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a little more amenable to
working with
the administration.

13:21.134 --> 13:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Price from HHS and the
vice president,
Mike Pence, are going to be the
point people

13:25.805 --> 13:27.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the administration.

13:27.707 --> 13:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one question is to what
extent the
administration will, in fact,
put down a proposal

13:32.945 --> 13:38.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and move toward Congress or wait
for Congress
to really do it and then come in
at the end.

13:38.418 --> 13:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Congress would like the
president
to lead as effectively as he
can, in part,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, to try to create the
consensus that
doesn't exist today.

13:46.559 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, Sue
Davis, there's
immigration, where -- I happened
to be at

13:50.129 --> 13:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lunch with the president
yesterday where
he was talking about he liked
want idea of

13:53.299 --> 13:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an immigration bill, if he could
get the two
sides to compromise.

13:56.202 --> 14:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't talk very much about
comprehensive
immigration reform last night.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He talked about the wall.

14:02.909 --> 14:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know there's that travel
ban, renewed
version of that.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But what is the mood?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the attitudes on the
Hill about immigration?

14:09.816 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN DAVIS: Well, here's what
we know is
going to happen.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a couple of weeks, he's going
to send a
request to Congress asking for
undetermined

14:14.921 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amounts of millions of dollars
to start building
that wall.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But immigration -- comprehensive
immigration
reform hasn't really been part
of the conversation

14:21.961 --> 14:23.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the Hill.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't part of the agenda
outlined by Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
and Speaker

14:26.165 --> 14:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan at the beginning of the
Congress.

14:27.900 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to the speaker's office
today that
said it's still not necessarily
at the top

14:32.038 --> 14:33.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the agenda.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if the president decides
that he wants
this to be a priority, he has
tremendous power

14:37.610 --> 14:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make it a priority and upend
what the congressional
schedule is.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, on that issue, where I
think Congress
is trying to take the lead on
things like

14:45.752 --> 14:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care and taxes, on
immigration, I think
they'd like to see the White
House be a little

14:49.288 --> 14:53.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit more assertive and outline
specifically
what the president would like to
do, specifically

14:53.626 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because that issue was such a
core, center
point of his campaign.

14:57.663 --> 15:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally to
the two of
you -- and I hate to ask you to
do this quickly

15:01.234 --> 15:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but, Dan Balz, the president
really mentioned
tax reform only briefly last
night, taxes

15:06.939 --> 15:08.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does it look -- what does
the atmosphere
look like?

15:10.309 --> 15:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the realities in terms
of getting
tax reform done this year?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN BALZ: Well, it will be very
challenging.

15:15.848 --> 15:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just simply getting the health
care bill through
will be potentially a year-long
effort, as

15:20.953 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we saw in the Obama
administration.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On taxes, they don't have a plan
at this point.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And health care will have to go
first.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Taxes will have to follow.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are questions about what
he really wants
to do.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He provided no details of that
last night.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He provided some principles on
health care
at least.

15:37.603 --> 15:44.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On tax reform and tax
legislation, he offered
nothing of substance beyond kind
of a generalized

15:44.644 --> 15:45.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
notion of what he wants.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you pick up
anything on
that, Sue?

15:47.313 --> 15:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN DAVIS: I see the fates of
health care
and taxes linked.

15:50.149 --> 15:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the repeal and replace effort
falls apart,
I think tax reform falls apart.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If repeal and replace, if
they're able to
get something to the president's
desk, I think

15:57.390 --> 16:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that increase the chances
that they can
actually move on taxes this
year.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think they can be seen
as separate
tracks.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they have to move
together.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is an
ambitious agenda.

16:05.898 --> 16:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN DAVIS: Extremely.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're talking
health care.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking -- and we didn't
even mention
infrastructure, which is
something the president

16:11.771 --> 16:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has said he wants to get done
too.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're going to leave it
there for now.

16:15.575 --> 16:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thank both of you for talking
to us, Dan
Balz of The Washington Post,
Susan Davis of

16:20.680 --> 16:21.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
NPR.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you.

16:28.287 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN BALZ: Thank you.

16:32.091 --> 16:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a month
after a controversial
special operations raid was
launched on a

16:38.497 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
moonless night in Yemen,
questions persist
about how that mission was
authorized, what

16:44.604 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it accomplished, and how it's
been explained
by the White House and by the
president.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Margaret Warner begins our
coverage.

16:51.310 --> 16:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Ryan's legacy is etched into
eternity.

16:56.482 --> 17:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Democrats and
Republicans
alike rose to their feet last
night the widow

17:01.888 --> 17:06.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was
killed during
a January raid in Yemen.

17:06.659 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Ryan died as he
lived, a warrior
and a hero, battling against
terrorism and

17:13.132 --> 17:14.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
securing our nation.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Trump White
House says
the raid was planned by the
Pentagon during

17:18.170 --> 17:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration, and
President Trump
gave the go-ahead during his
first week in

17:23.843 --> 17:25.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

17:25.878 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon intended as an
intelligence-gathering
mission against al-Qaida in the
Arabian Peninsula,

17:31.083 --> 17:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the militant group's most
feared branches.

17:34.587 --> 17:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a gun battle erupted, and
Owens was killed,
reportedly along with as many as
30 civilians,

17:40.693 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
including children.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the president said
Defense Secretary
Mattis told him the mission
would lead to

17:46.832 --> 17:48.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
victories in the future.

17:48.567 --> 17:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Ryan was a part of
a highly
successful raid that generated
large amounts

17:54.707 --> 17:56.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of vital intelligence.

17:56.475 --> 18:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But others
question that
claim, and last month,
Republican Senator

18:00.079 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John McCain suggested the raid
was a failure.

18:03.683 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump respond by charging
such criticism
only emboldened the enemy, and
White House

18:09.188 --> 18:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.

18:11.190 --> 18:15.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I think anybody who undermines
the success

18:15.494 --> 18:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that raid owes an apology and
does a disservice
to the life of Chief Owens.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The SEAL's
father, William
Owens, refused to meet with the
president

18:23.903 --> 18:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when his son's remains were
flown home.

18:26.439 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he told The Miami
Herald that Mr.
Trump shouldn't -- quote --
"hide behind his

18:31.544 --> 18:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
son's death to prevent an
investigation."

18:34.714 --> 18:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president again deflected
criticism in
an interview aired yesterday on
FOX News,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying he followed the
military's advice.

18:42.321 --> 18:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This was a mission
that was
started before I got here.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They explained what they wanted
to do, the
generals, who are very
respected.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they lost Ryan.

18:50.529 --> 18:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, South
Carolina Republican
Lindsey Graham offered this
advice:

18:55.034 --> 18:56.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Don't
oversell results.

18:58.704 --> 19:07.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only sin I think a commander
in chief
can make is exaggerating
successes and not

19:07.213 --> 19:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
understanding the challenges.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

19:11.917 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And joining me
now from the
White House, Sebastian Gorka.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is deputy assistant to the
president.

19:17.957 --> 19:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He advises the administration on
national
security issues.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Gorka, thank you for being
with us.

19:23.295 --> 19:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Picking up on what we heard from
senator Graham,
did the president fully
understand the challenges

19:28.634 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involved when he signed off on
this?

19:30.469 --> 19:32.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy
Assistant to President
Trump: Of course he did.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the commander in chief.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He takes his job very, very
seriously.

19:36.642 --> 19:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the way he's
treated law enforcement,
if you look at the way he's
treated the military,

19:40.980 --> 19:45.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this is a man who fully
understands the burden
of leadership and the
responsibility he has

19:45.785 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the commander in chief.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he
suggested in that
interview with FOX News
yesterday that he

19:51.157 --> 19:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did it mainly because the
generals suggested
that he do it, that they
recommended it.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that the case?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: We don't give
our internal
playbook away.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what the last
administration did.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how people get in big,
big trouble.

20:05.604 --> 20:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are classified operations
by our tier
one operators.

20:10.109 --> 20:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he acted and made a decision
based upon
the best advice of our military.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the way it has to work,
Judy.

20:17.750 --> 20:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, my question
is, Mr. Gorka,
because we just -- again,
looking at that

20:22.221 --> 20:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX interview, referring to the
generals,
the president said, "They lost
Ryan."

20:28.928 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that mean he doesn't accept
responsibility?

20:31.363 --> 20:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: Of course it
doesn't.

20:33.199 --> 20:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I find it quite churlish
when the media
focuses on half a sentence here,
half a sentence

20:38.504 --> 20:39.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why would you even posit that of
the president?

20:41.974 --> 20:43.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really unbecoming.

20:43.542 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the president
accepts,
in effect, the buck stops with
him?

20:48.147 --> 20:49.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: Of course he
does.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's the president.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a team effort,
nevertheless.

20:53.018 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody goes into battle alone,
but he is the
commander in chief.

20:57.423 --> 21:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We also heard the
president
say that the raid was highly
successful, that

21:02.895 --> 21:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it generated a large amount of
intelligence
that will be valuable, useful
for the administration.

21:08.968 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also know that there are
a number of
news organization reporting that
senior officials

21:13.606 --> 21:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that is not the case,
that there is
not valuable intelligence from
that raid.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we to believe?

21:20.546 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: Is that the
same kind of
sources that reported all kinds
of fallacious

21:24.517 --> 21:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things inside the White House?

21:26.318 --> 21:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sad truth is, Judy, since I
started working
here six weeks ago, I find that
more than

21:31.657 --> 21:36.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
50 percent of the more
sensational things
I read are wholly fallacious and
unfounded.

21:36.495 --> 21:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you because I'm
inside the building
when those decisions are being
taken.

21:40.566 --> 21:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's easy to make up unnamed
sources,
but the fact is life is a little
different

21:45.304 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from what you would read in the
mainstream
media inside the White House.

21:48.307 --> 21:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say
to the American
people who are asking, why is
the U.S. in

21:52.611 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yemen in the first place?

21:54.013 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: Oh, very easy,
very, very
easy.

21:56.815 --> 22:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the president pointed out
yesterday, we
are facing a global threat.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is radical Islamic terrorism.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another great synonym is the
global jihadi
movement.

22:08.761 --> 22:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that Yemen or
another country
that doesn't have adequate
governance is not

22:13.799 --> 22:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potentially connected to the
threat to the
United States is, again, a very,
very dangerous

22:19.004 --> 22:20.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
concept.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
These aren't just events
occurring 8,000 or
10,000 miles away.

22:23.576 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, Omar Mateen, as he
slayed 49 Americans
in the Pulse nightclub, stopped
to dial 911,

22:31.951 --> 22:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to call an ambulance, Judy,
but to swear
allegiance to Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi in the

22:36.789 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Middle East.

22:38.457 --> 22:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's just how interconnected
the threat
is today and how real the war is
from the

22:42.695 --> 22:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets of Aleppo right to
Orlando.

22:45.130 --> 22:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
pick up on
the phrase you just used,
radical Islamic

22:49.034 --> 22:50.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorism.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We heard the president say that
last night.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has also been reported,
as you know,
several news organizations, that
the president's

22:56.508 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new security adviser, General
H.R. McMaster,
has advised the president not to
use that

23:02.615 --> 23:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term, in effect because it
suggests that all
who believe in Islam as a faith,
that there's

23:09.221 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some strain there that's
connected to terrorism.

23:12.024 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: How does it --
A, the reports
are, again, false.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's fake news.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not true.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to talk to General
McMaster, who
I talked to yesterday before the
speech.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not what he said.

23:24.470 --> 23:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, how does the phrase
radical Islamic
terrorism link all the believers
of a faith

23:32.111 --> 23:33.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to terrorism?

23:33.879 --> 23:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I said radical Christian
terrorism, does
that mean I as a Catholic are a
terrorist?

23:38.083 --> 23:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I'm just
trying to understand.

23:41.120 --> 23:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're saying the president
is not suggesting
that there is something inherent
in all of

23:46.158 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islam that is at odds with
Western values?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: That would be
asinine.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course he didn't.

23:52.031 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are dealing with a version of
Islam, with
criminals, mass murderers,
people who run

23:57.870 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slave markets, that use a
religion, use a
seventh century, atavistic,
blood-curdled

24:04.610 --> 24:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
version of it to justify their
actions.

24:07.179 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can tell you, the idea
that you can
separate jihadi terrorism from
Islam is exactly

24:13.285 --> 24:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what got us in the mess we are
today, with
65 million refugees around the
world and with

24:18.524 --> 24:21.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS controlling territory in
multiple countries.

24:21.427 --> 24:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you talk to Muslims, as I do
-- I have
trained hundreds of Muslim
officers from our

24:25.998 --> 24:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partner nations when I was in
the Defense
Department -- they will tell
you, Judy, this

24:30.302 --> 24:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a war inside Islam for the
heart of Islam.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are not at war with Islam.

24:35.708 --> 24:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a very dangerous and
very fallacious
idea.

24:39.311 --> 24:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we know that our Muslim
allies are fighting
a war for the heart of Islam.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ask the Jordanians.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ask the Egyptians.

24:48.153 --> 24:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understand the relevance of
jihadist
ideology in this war.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sebastian Gorka,
who is a deputy
assistant to President Trump, we
thank you

24:56.862 --> 24:57.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN GORKA: My pleasure.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Any time, Judy.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now views on
the raid in
Yemen and the decision-making
behind it.

25:03.369 --> 25:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk to two men with intimate
knowledge
of the process that authorized
the use of

25:07.439 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military force during the Obama
administration.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colin Kahl was deputy assistant
to the president
and national security adviser to
the vice

25:14.346 --> 25:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president during the Obama
administration.

25:16.482 --> 25:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now an associate professor
at Georgetown
University.

25:19.952 --> 25:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Exum was deputy assistant
secretary
of defense for Middle East
policy during the

25:23.689 --> 25:25.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama administration.

25:25.090 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also served in the Army form
2000 to 2004
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Colin, let me start with you.

25:31.597 --> 25:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard the president say,
this was
a mission that was started
before I got here.

25:35.134 --> 25:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were in the rooms where
these mission
have been discussed for the
Obama administration

25:39.338 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
before he left.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What did the previous
administration leave
for President Trump to pick up?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy
Assistant to President
Obama: Yes.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, for years, the United
States has been
taking military action against
this group,

25:48.947 --> 25:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula, al
Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen,
predominantly

25:53.252 --> 25:55.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through drone strikes,
airstrikes.

25:55.888 --> 26:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What came to the White House
shortly before
Christmas was a proposal from
the Pentagon

26:01.059 --> 26:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to expand the authorities and
resources to
allow special operations forces
to more actively

26:05.931 --> 26:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engage in direct raids to go
after compounds,
like the one that we saw in
January.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a couple of things, I think,
are important
to note.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, they never briefed a
particular raid.

26:15.641 --> 26:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't say, we're going to
go after a
particular target or a compound
on this night

26:19.378 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or this day.

26:20.946 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, they asked for a broad
set of authorities
to do this type of thing.

26:23.982 --> 26:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, importantly, when the
deputies convened,
kind of a sub-cabinet level of
government

26:28.754 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convened in early January, they
recommended
that this decision get deferred
to the Trump

26:34.393 --> 26:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration, so they could
run their own
careful process.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama agreed on
that, that he
would make no decision whether
to do things

26:40.599 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this, and instead that
Trump should run
his own process.

26:43.469 --> 26:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, instead, Trump had a dinner
party and
decided it over dinner.

26:46.438 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you're
saying the category
of raids was what was discussed,
not this

26:50.409 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specific raid, because we saw
reports that
perhaps they were waiting for a
moonless night,

26:54.279 --> 26:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was the opportune time, it
couldn't have
happened in the Obama
administration's last

26:57.483 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few days.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /COLIN KAHL: I will defer
to Andrew,
who worked in the Pentagon, on
this one.

27:02.554 --> 27:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my understanding is that
there were a
number of concepts of operations
that were

27:06.225 --> 27:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bouncing around the Pentagon for
a long time,
and this raid may have been one
of them.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was never brought across the
river to the
White House.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as it relates to the
moonless night issue,
a Pentagon spokesperson said
that that issue

27:17.936 --> 27:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't become relevant until
after January
20, when they then asked for the
authority

27:23.275 --> 27:25.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do the raid to Trump.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, importantly, that's why I
think it's
extraordinarily unfair to our
men and women

27:28.647 --> 27:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the armed services for Trump
to suggest,
as he did on FOX yesterday, that
somehow this

27:33.619 --> 27:34.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the military's fault.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the commander in chief.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The buck stops with him.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Exum,
fill in that
blank there.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Pentagon's perspective,
what was
left for the Trump
administration?

27:40.692 --> 27:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant
Secretary of Defense: Well, no,
I think that

27:42.594 --> 27:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's an accurate recounting of
the way that
things were presented to the
Trump administration

27:47.332 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to the Obama administration
before the
-- before the Trump
inauguration.

27:51.737 --> 27:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we in the Obama
administration,
those are of us who served in
the Obama administration

27:55.707 --> 28:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to be very careful as we
criticize the
process that the Trump
administration used

28:00.212 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to approve this.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First off, to approve this raid,
it would
have gone through several
hurdles just through

28:05.450 --> 28:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Department of Defense before
being presented
to the president.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we in the Obama
administration brought
these options to the president,
it followed

28:13.492 --> 28:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very deliberate interagency
process.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what worked for President
Obama.

28:18.897 --> 28:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because we have seen, quite
frankly,
a lot of a -- lot of mess in the
Trump administration

28:24.903 --> 28:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thus far in their first month, I
think we
have got to be careful about
saying that we

28:28.574 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had all the answers during the
Obama administration.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Colin would agree with
that.

28:33.178 --> 28:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This president's going find a
decision-making
process that works for him.

28:36.949 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened in Yemen may cause
him to rethink
the way in which he approved
this raid, because

28:42.421 --> 28:44.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can always delegate
authority.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can never delegate the risk.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, you're going to own
that, as Dr.
Gorka mentioned from the White
House.

28:50.028 --> 28:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, I want
to -- you
recently wrote that blaming the
president

28:53.599 --> 28:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is both inappropriate and
counterproductive.

28:56.902 --> 29:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also described sometimes
that the process
can be paralysis by analysis.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That it can
take a very
long time.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: No, that's right.

29:05.210 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colin remembers that, at one
point in the
waning days of the Obama
administration, I

29:09.548 --> 29:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we were debating at the
Cabinet level
the movement of three
helicopters from Iraq

29:14.987 --> 29:16.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Syria.

29:16.822 --> 29:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there are obvious, you
know, political
implications of anything you do
on the ground.

29:20.993 --> 29:24.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But at what point do you
delegate authority
down to your commander on the
ground, I think,

29:24.863 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the key question.

29:26.698 --> 29:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason why I think putting
the -- putting
real blame on the Trump
administration here

29:30.802 --> 29:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is dangerous is because you have
the Benghazi
effect.

29:33.672 --> 29:38.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You remember, when the
Republicans used Benghazi
and what happened there as a
cudgel to beat

29:38.343 --> 29:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, and without --
you know their
effort was successful, it must
be added, to

29:43.048 --> 29:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weaken her as a political
candidate.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it also had a chilling
effect on the bureaucracy.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It makes the bureaucracy
risk-averse.

29:49.087 --> 29:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, quite frankly, that's not
something that
we want from our diplomats.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not something we want from
our special
operators.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want them to be aggressive.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want them to take risks.

29:57.929 --> 30:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we elevate the blame,
when something
goes wrong, all the way to the
presidential

30:02.401 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level, we just have got to be
very careful
about how we do that.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Colin,
why does it
take so long?

30:08.473 --> 30:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kinds of input factor into
a decision
like this?

30:11.176 --> 30:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /COLIN KAHL: Yes, look, I
think that
the Obama administration can be
criticized

30:14.146 --> 30:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for too much micromanagement of
the Pentagon.

30:16.448 --> 30:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, you know, the question
is, did they
swing the pendulum too far in
one direction?

30:21.253 --> 30:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I worry that President
Trump, in the first
big decision that came to his,
in this case,

30:26.024 --> 30:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dinner table as commander in
chief, he swung
the pendulum all the way back in
the other

30:30.562 --> 30:32.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, what President Obama
insisted on is,
every time that the military
wanted to come

30:34.566 --> 30:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward to ask for authority to
significantly
escalate, especially to put
ground forces

30:39.805 --> 30:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a conflict environment,
where people
can die, both our service
members, but also

30:44.376 --> 30:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civilians and others, that we
needed to have
a careful, deliberate process.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't have to take weeks.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It oftentimes takes a couple of
days.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it works its way through,
and you get
the inputs from all the various
agencies.

30:55.687 --> 31:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question I have with Trump's
decision-making
process here is not that you
have to do it

31:00.492 --> 31:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly the way we did it, but
he didn't run
a process at all.

31:03.895 --> 31:08.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He just had dinner with
Secretary Mattis and
General Dunford and a handful of
close advisers

31:08.800 --> 31:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and was briefed about the raid
and made a
decision.

31:11.436 --> 31:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a consequence, he didn't
have the
full benefit of his intelligence
professionals,

31:15.774 --> 31:17.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his State Department.

31:17.275 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is a recipe for making
mistakes and
costing people their lives.

31:20.479 --> 31:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Exum,
what about
the idea that, when there are
these different

31:25.117 --> 31:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies, these different people
weighing
in on it, that they're going to
think about

31:28.353 --> 31:33.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
diplomatic consequences,
political consequences,
things that perhaps a commander
in the field

31:33.692 --> 31:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might not think about because,
for him or
her, they see a much different
objective?

31:38.096 --> 31:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes, it's a valid
point.

31:39.931 --> 31:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the way Colin described
things, I
think he's right that the
pendulum swung back.

31:43.702 --> 31:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't say it went all the
way back, because,
again, the decision-making
process in this

31:47.405 --> 31:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raid would have gone through a
very rigorous
process in the Pentagon.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have been blessed off
by all the
Pentagon senior leaders before
it would have

31:54.479 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been presented to the president.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it wasn't completely without
rigor.

31:58.150 --> 32:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what Colin is
describing in terms
of baking down the risk, that
does happen

32:03.722 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a deliberate process like
that.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The key question is opportunity
cost.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the Obama administration,
we had a
very deliberate process that in
many cases

32:11.763 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
served the president and was
what the president
desired.

32:14.900 --> 32:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It drew down a lot of political
risks, as
well as the physical risk, to
the operators

32:20.205 --> 32:21.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, was there an
opportunity
cost?

32:23.475 --> 32:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nature of these raids is,
they go after
time-sensitive targets.

32:26.812 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So do you lose opportunities the
more that
you hold things up in
Washington?

32:31.983 --> 32:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's the key question.

32:33.819 --> 32:37.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And where Colin and I may
disagree, but where
I think we do agree, is that
there has to

32:37.989 --> 32:39.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be a balance.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just a matter of where you
strike that
balance.

32:41.259 --> 32:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Andrew Exum,
Colin Kahl, thank you both.

32:53.405 --> 32:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

32:56.474 --> 33:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
successes
and struggles of two of the
world's fastest

33:01.179 --> 33:07.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing businesses; and a plan
to once again
send humans to the moon.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: the nation's opioid
crisis.

33:10.655 --> 33:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overdose deaths are on the rise
across the
country, in 2015, surpassing gun
homicides

33:16.228 --> 33:17.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the first time.

33:17.896 --> 33:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the hardest-hit states is
Maryland,
where the governor today
declared a state

33:22.000 --> 33:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of emergency to fight the
epidemic.

33:24.202 --> 33:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for more than a year, the
city of Baltimore
has been training everyday
citizens in how

33:29.875 --> 33:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use a lifesaving antidote, an
approach
that's catching on across the
country.

33:35.113 --> 33:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" producer Pamela
Kirkland visited
Baltimore to find out more.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Excuse me, sir, are you
interested in
Narcan training?

33:42.120 --> 33:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Each week, city
health workers
hit the streets of Baltimore,
handing out

33:45.790 --> 33:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an emergency medication that
brings users
back from the dead.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: This is the medicine.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It reverses overdoses.

33:52.330 --> 33:57.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Naloxone, brand
name Narcan,
comes as a nasal spray or
injection, and works

33:57.068 --> 34:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by blocking the brain's opioid
receptors.

34:00.305 --> 34:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a city with 24,000 active
heroin users,
overdoses, and now increasingly
this emergency

34:06.278 --> 34:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
antidote have become facts of
life.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I lost a friend of mine
that was -- at
25 years old.

34:12.851 --> 34:19.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I have just seen so many
young people
getting hooked on the opioids,
or better yet,

34:19.791 --> 34:20.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fentanyl.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's definitely a killer,

34:22.594 --> 34:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: In Maryland,
deaths from
opioids, which include heroin,
fentanyl and

34:26.298 --> 34:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prescription painkillers,
doubled between
2010 and 2015, to just under
1,100 people

34:32.704 --> 34:34.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, heroin fatalities
alone more than
tripled.

34:37.742 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in just the past three
years, deaths in
Baltimore from fentanyl, a
synthetic opioid

34:42.814 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far stronger than heroin, are up
20-fold.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health
Commissioner:
We have an epidemic of people,
fellow residents

34:50.221 --> 34:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in our city, who are dying from
opioid overdose.

34:53.358 --> 34:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: In late 2015,
Dr. Leana Wen,
Baltimore's health commissioner,
and a practicing

34:58.964 --> 35:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency room physician, issued
a standing
order for naloxone to all
620,000 city residents.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:07.038 --> 35:10.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEANA WEN: What that means is
that, if somebody
goes through a very basic
training -- and

35:10.809 --> 35:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do trainings everywhere,
including on street
corners, in jails, in public
housing, really

35:16.548 --> 35:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anywhere that people are -- they
will immediately
get a prescription for naloxone,
and even

35:21.920 --> 35:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get the medication in hand.

35:23.355 --> 35:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Just one dose
of naloxone
can bring someone back.

35:27.625 --> 35:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Residents can buy it at a
pharmacy, only $1
for Medicaid recipients.

35:31.963 --> 35:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks to a 2015 good
samaritan law, there's
no risk of prosecution if
citizens intervene

35:37.936 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the victim dies.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I have used it four times.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I keep them in my bag.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I always keep them in my bag, at
least four
or five of them in my bag.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health
Department:
This is our mobile unit.

35:46.544 --> 35:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: John Harris
works on one
of the Health Department's vans
which traverse

35:50.281 --> 35:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city offering sexually
transmitted infection
screenings, clean needle kits
and naloxone

35:56.154 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
training.

35:58.023 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HARRIS: Well, we tell
people that, once
you reverse an overdose, then
not to use that.

36:01.593 --> 36:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: He knows what
addiction can
do to a person, having spent 16
years addicted

36:06.865 --> 36:08.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to heroin.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he sees something different
today.

36:09.901 --> 36:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HARRIS: There was a lot of
fentanyl at
first that we were hearing
about.

36:14.406 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now the clients are starting
to come with
medications that they use on an
elephant,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tranquilizers being cut with
heroin.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are benzodiazepines.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're hearing about all
different types of
drugs.

36:29.587 --> 36:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really becoming more
complicated and
dangerous.

36:31.990 --> 36:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Since January
2015, the Baltimore
Health Department says over
20,000 residents

36:37.829 --> 36:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have completed naloxone training
and at least
800 lives have been saved.

36:42.767 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And many more states and
municipalities across
the country have moved to make
naloxone more

36:47.839 --> 36:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
accessible to the public.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But not everyone believes this
is the right
approach.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction
Recovery Center:
We are selling it to the public
as if it's

36:56.114 --> 36:57.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the answer.

36:57.916 --> 37:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's an amazing drug, no
doubt about
it, but it doesn't change the
behavior of

37:03.321 --> 37:05.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the addict.

37:05.123 --> 37:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: For 25 years,
Mike Gimbel
was Baltimore County's director
of substance

37:08.626 --> 37:10.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abuse.

37:10.495 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he's a consultant for
Maryland Addiction
Recovery Center, a private
treatment facility

37:14.933 --> 37:16.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside the city.

37:16.134 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And like John Harris, Gimbel is
in recovery.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE GIMBEL: Heroin is the
devil.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's the devil.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It makes you do things you would
never do
you in your life.

37:27.679 --> 37:33.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took a middle-class, good
Jewish kid like
me, and had me robing my own
parents, carrying

37:33.718 --> 37:35.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a gun.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what heroin does.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's how powerful heroin is.

37:38.289 --> 37:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: He argues that
the city and
state are spending too much time
and money

37:42.460 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Narcan training and outreach,
and not enough
on long-term recovery.

37:47.298 --> 37:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a sign this approach
isn't working,
he points to the city's rising
overdose fatalities,

37:52.570 --> 37:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up 68 percent for the first
three-quarters
of 2016 over the same period the
year before.

37:59.177 --> 38:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GIMBEL: Sometimes, by
having Narcan so
available, it actually
reinforces the addict's

38:07.585 --> 38:09.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

38:09.254 --> 38:15.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why should I stop using heroin,
when, if I
overdose, Narcan's going to save
my life?

38:15.493 --> 38:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where's the motivation to stop?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not there.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not there.

38:22.467 --> 38:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, sometimes, yes -- and we
don't want to
see people die, but, sometimes,
watching someone

38:26.704 --> 38:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
die and watching what happens
with overdose
and death wakes up a lot of
addicts.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore
Police Officer:
It's just a first-responder
tool.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all it is.

38:34.979 --> 38:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Timmy Hall was
with the Baltimore
Police Department for 24 years,
where he routinely

38:38.983 --> 38:41.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
saw opioid overdoses.

38:41.119 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says officers often use
Narcan to revive
the same drug users over and
over again.

38:46.758 --> 38:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMMY HALL: A lot of times, they
get upset
with you when you bring them
back, because

38:51.529 --> 38:53.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they feel like you wasted the
money they spent.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, that's the feeling
that they wanted.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That wanted that feeling, and
you took it
away from them.

38:57.902 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: But Hall
doesn't see an alternative.

38:59.971 --> 39:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMMY HALL: As a police officer,
your first
job is to protect and serve, you
know?

39:04.609 --> 39:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what officer would want to
sit there and
watch somebody die, if they got
the tools

39:07.845 --> 39:08.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to save somebody?

39:08.846 --> 39:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Narcan, to me, is a great
tool.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just a first-responder
tool.

39:12.450 --> 39:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: The Health
Department attributes
the continued rise in overdoses
and fatalities

39:17.055 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a rise in far more powerful
drugs hitting
the streets.

39:20.825 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Wen says there's no evidence
that denying
naloxone to overdose victims
helps users end

39:26.331 --> 39:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their addictions.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Naloxone is just one tool in
this fight.

39:30.435 --> 39:32.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEANA WEN: We are just treading
water if all
we're doing is saving someone's
life right

39:34.305 --> 39:35.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

39:35.974 --> 39:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also know that we have to get
them the
second part, which is access to
long-term

39:39.244 --> 39:44.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
treatments, that it's a
combination of medications
and some treatments,
psychosocial treatments,

39:44.315 --> 39:45.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like counseling.

39:45.683 --> 39:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then other services are
important too,
including housing.

39:48.519 --> 39:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Of course,
those all cost
money and political will.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

39:54.192 --> 39:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:
Heroin and opioid
abuse has been taking lives and
tearing apart

39:58.162 --> 40:00.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Just today,
Maryland's Republican
governor, Larry Hogan, announced
a state of

40:03.101 --> 40:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency to deal with the
crisis, pledging
50 million additional dollars
over five years

40:08.873 --> 40:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for enforcement, treatment and
prevention.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN HARRIS: It's got to get
better.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's got to get better.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I believe it will get
better.

40:16.848 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think perfection exists
in anything,
but I do believe Baltimore has
done a lot

40:22.920 --> 40:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of good work, will do some more
good work,
because we are saving lives.

40:27.358 --> 40:31.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: Saving some
lives amid a
growing epidemic.

40:31.429 --> 40:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Pamela Kirkland
in Baltimore.

40:38.102 --> 40:52.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: two
high-flying companies
whose value has soared and are
the subject

40:52.784 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of intense scrutiny, Uber, and
the parent
company of Snapchat.

40:56.721 --> 41:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Uber, it's about the culture
and leadership
of the ride-hailing service,
valued at nearly

41:01.592 --> 41:03.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$70 billion.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's back in the spotlight
following release
of a video of its CEO berating
an Uber driver.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
More on that in a moment.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, Snapchat is about to
sell its
stock to the public for the
first time.

41:12.937 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The parent company announced it
will offer
its share at $17 a share,
bringing its value

41:18.009 --> 41:20.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to nearly $24 billion.

41:20.712 --> 41:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The messaging app is used by
nearly 160 million
people each day, and is
especially popular

41:25.683 --> 41:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
among teens and young adults.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are big questions
about whether
it's worth this kind of value.

41:31.756 --> 41:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Isaac is covering both
these stories
for The New York Times.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He joins me now.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's start with Snapchat.

41:36.461 --> 41:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the value that Snapchat
is trying
to sell investors?

41:39.063 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:
Yes.

41:41.099 --> 41:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Snapchat's big story is,
it's going to
be its next Facebook and not the
next Twitter,

41:46.471 --> 41:48.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
essentially.

41:48.306 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of Twitter's big struggles,
if you remember,
when it went public a few years
ago, is, it

41:52.210 --> 41:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of failed to grow fast
enough for investors
on Wall Street.

41:57.348 --> 42:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as far as Facebook is
concerned, their
growth was huge, but Snapchat
just wants to

42:02.387 --> 42:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, like, look, this is the
next big social
network.

42:04.655 --> 42:09.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to get in as quickly as
possible
on the ground floor of this IPO,
and we're

42:09.660 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have the success and
strength and
reach of Facebook, particularly
with younger

42:15.166 --> 42:16.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
users.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How does it
plan to make
money?

42:17.435 --> 42:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, it calls itself
now a camera
company.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, is it a social network?

42:21.372 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it a camera company?

42:22.607 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do they make money selling
advertisements?

42:24.308 --> 42:28.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE ISAAC: Yes, so it's
primarily advertisements.

42:28.246 --> 42:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have little what they call
Snapchat stories.

42:32.550 --> 42:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And publications like The New
York Times will
show different things inside of
their -- usually

42:39.290 --> 42:40.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
video and photo-based.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they sell ads against
that.

42:42.860 --> 42:46.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then they're kind of
experimenting with
other things, whether it's like
e-commerce-related

42:46.597 --> 42:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things inside the app.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then who knows?

42:50.535 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have what are called
Snapchat Spectacles,
which are glasses on your face,
and maybe

42:54.705 --> 42:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they can make money from that.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not really sure.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so part of
the reason
that it looks like Wall Street
is excited

42:59.444 --> 43:01.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is because there hasn't been a
big tech IPO
in a while.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Yes, that's right.

43:03.681 --> 43:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of investors feel
like they
missed out on Facebook a few
years ago, especially

43:10.688 --> 43:14.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when the IPO went really
terribly for the
company, and now Facebook is
trading at over

43:14.859 --> 43:17.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$100 a share.

43:17.261 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think everyone is really
looking forward
to a successful IPO from a tech
company.

43:21.365 --> 43:23.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it has been a bit.

43:23.234 --> 43:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And these two
founders have
also decided to take a lot of
the -- I guess

43:26.838 --> 43:28.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the voting control of the
company.

43:28.673 --> 43:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This seems to be the new thing.

43:30.107 --> 43:33.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous
amount of
control over his company.

43:33.411 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this the kind of template
that now tech
CEOs want?

43:35.646 --> 43:37.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE ISAAC: I think so.

43:37.448 --> 43:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think investors kind of
have a sense
of trust that the founders tend
to know best

43:44.188 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what's best for their
company.

43:46.390 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Zuckerberg really sort of
became the
pioneer or advocate for this
approach, where,

43:52.530 --> 43:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, he doesn't really want
to hear much
of what investors have to say
about how he

43:57.935 --> 43:59.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should run his company.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And investors are comfortable
with that because
he tends to be running it really
well, and

44:02.340 --> 44:04.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it keeps growing, and it keeps
making them
tons of money.

44:04.675 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that might work.

44:05.743 --> 44:06.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:06.744 --> 44:07.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sorry.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's shift gears then to Uber.

44:09.614 --> 44:13.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been in the news recently
after a former
employee wrote on her personal
blog that she

44:13.618 --> 44:17.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been sexually harassed at
the company
and that it was covered up.

44:17.421 --> 44:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, Bloomberg released a
video of Uber
CEO Travis Kalanick in a heated
exchange with

44:22.393 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an Uber driver over lowering
fares for its
black cars service.

44:26.531 --> 44:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The argument took place in
February.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You changed the whole
business.

44:29.767 --> 44:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber:
What?

44:31.169 --> 44:32.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What?

44:32.136 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: You dropped the prices.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK: On black.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, you did.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:36.140 --> 44:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We started with $20.

44:37.141 --> 44:38.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We started with $20.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much is the mile now, $2.75?

44:39.143 --> 44:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK: You know what?

44:40.144 --> 44:41.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: What?

44:41.679 --> 44:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK: Some people
don't like to
take responsibility for their...

44:42.146 --> 44:43.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:43.648 --> 44:47.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK: They blame
everything in
their life on somebody else.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:48.219 --> 44:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVIS KALANICK: Good luck.

44:49.554 --> 44:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Good luck to you, too.

44:52.390 --> 44:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kalanick later
apologized.

44:54.725 --> 44:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said in a statement: "It's
clear this video
is a reflection of me, and the
criticism we

44:59.997 --> 45:05.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have received is a stark
reminder that I must
fundamentally change as a leader
and grow

45:05.736 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up."

45:06.737 --> 45:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's part of the statement.

45:08.239 --> 45:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Mike, why is this apology to
the driver
and the company so important?

45:12.543 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: If you followed the
company for
the past seven years, one thing
you can say

45:17.949 --> 45:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Travis Kalanick, he's
pretty unapologetic.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's aggressive.

45:23.921 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's pushed into markets where
operating Uber
was actually illegal.

45:28.292 --> 45:33.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's been a real
no-holds-barred approach
to operating a company.

45:33.264 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to see him say, I have to be
humble, I
have to change the type of
leader that I am

45:38.069 --> 45:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a real big shift for them.

45:39.503 --> 45:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm really curious if he can
actually
do it at this point.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is
also a company
that is not public yet, but when
it goes,

45:46.944 --> 45:52.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it goes, the valuations are
staggering
-- $70 billion is currently
where it's at.

45:52.283 --> 45:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does this call into question
perhaps the temperament
of this individual and whether
he is the right

45:57.021 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person to run such a big global
company?

45:59.624 --> 46:01.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Yes, I think that's
right.

46:01.559 --> 46:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost a $70 billion valuation,
I think investors,
as well as employees, are
wondering, we had

46:07.064 --> 46:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this CEO who got us through the
really tough
early phases.

46:10.668 --> 46:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can this person lead us through
an IPO, where
people really want a more even
keel?

46:16.073 --> 46:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think everyone is still
asking that
question, but it's not really
clear at this

46:19.043 --> 46:20.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

46:20.845 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is in the
wake of the
revelations of a woman who left
the company,

46:24.582 --> 46:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she had this -- part of this
to say in
her blog.

46:27.051 --> 46:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It became obvious that both
H.R. and management
had been lying about this being
his first

46:33.391 --> 46:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offense, and it certainly wasn't
his last.

46:35.126 --> 46:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The situation was escalated as
far up the
chain as it could be escalated,
and still

46:38.696 --> 46:39.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing was done."

46:39.730 --> 46:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's not talking about Travis.

46:41.532 --> 46:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's talking about one of her
managers who
she contends was harassing to
her, and now

46:45.603 --> 46:47.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a large investigation.

46:47.505 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a big deal for the
company.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Yes, this is -- you
know, this
is core to how the culture
operates.

46:53.210 --> 46:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's very -- to take
it from Facebook,
move fast and break things.

46:58.082 --> 47:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at some point, you have to
sort of clean
things up on the inside and
change, especially

47:02.486 --> 47:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if you want to go public.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they're really
facing that question
right now.

47:06.557 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just a question of, can you
do it and
how long will it take?

47:09.427 --> 47:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For a little
while, there
was -- and there might still be
continuing

47:11.929 --> 47:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- a delete Uber campaign.

47:13.397 --> 47:15.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did that have an impact on their
business?

47:15.132 --> 47:16.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE ISAAC: Yes, it did.

47:16.901 --> 47:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- I would say it's not a
material
financial impact, but I have
spoken to a number

47:20.404 --> 47:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people who were watching that
go down inside.

47:23.307 --> 47:27.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there were
hundreds of thousands
of people that deleted their
Uber accounts

47:27.411 --> 47:31.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entirely, and probably hundreds
of thousands
more that just deleted the app.

47:31.282 --> 47:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it worried Uber, and they
definitely tried
to curb it pretty quickly.

47:34.952 --> 47:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mike Isaac of
The New York Times, thanks so
much.

47:38.723 --> 47:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Thanks for having
me.

47:47.698 --> 47:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to our
Leading edge
segment for this week: a
potential return

47:54.338 --> 47:56.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the moon.

47:56.140 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Near the end of his address last
night, the
president made a reference to
space travel,

47:59.610 --> 48:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying -- quote -- "American
footprints on
distant worlds are not too big a
dream."

48:05.149 --> 48:06.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was only a line.

48:07.017 --> 48:11.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whenever a president speaks
on the subject,
the space community is closely
trying to read

48:11.555 --> 48:13.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tea leaves.

48:13.390 --> 48:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sentence leaves a lot to
interpretation,
but all signs seem to indicate
there is renewed

48:17.795 --> 48:24.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
focus inside the Trump
administration, NASA
and the private sector on travel
to the moon,

48:24.401 --> 48:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sooner than you might think.

48:26.103 --> 48:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
is here.

48:29.106 --> 48:31.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Miles, why the moon after
all these years?

48:31.609 --> 48:35.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Aside from the
"because it's
there" answer, it's actually a
good destination

48:35.913 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go and learn about living and
working on
an encampment in space.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we went to the moon 50
years ago
now.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We left some footprints and
flags behind,
but we didn't really learn how
to live there

48:46.524 --> 48:48.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a sustained basis.

48:48.359 --> 48:51.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while NASA would still like
to go to Mars,
there's a lot of things you can
learn about

48:51.929 --> 48:53.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by setting up an encampment on
the moon.

48:53.998 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have learned in the past
50 years there's
a lot of water ice on the moon.

48:58.636 --> 48:59.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is water?

48:59.603 --> 49:00.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hydrogen and oxygen.

49:00.604 --> 49:01.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is rocket fuel?

49:01.806 --> 49:03.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hydrogen and oxygen.

49:03.674 --> 49:09.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you can learn a lot about how
to create
rocket fuel on location and
perhaps push deeper

49:09.113 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into space.

49:10.881 --> 49:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So this didn't
just spring
up as an idea because they
couldn't think

49:12.583 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of anything else?

49:13.651 --> 49:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, there was
one other factor.

49:15.319 --> 49:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a mission planned at
the end of
'18 for the Space Launch System,
which is

49:19.690 --> 49:23.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next heavy lift that NASA is
working -- heavy
lift rocket.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One piece of it wasn't going to
be ready,
built by the Europeans, a
service module.

49:26.864 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so NASA was faced with the
possibility
of delaying that mission, an
unmanned mission,

49:31.235 --> 49:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even later, or maybe doing
something like
we did with Apollo 8, something
bold.

49:35.539 --> 49:38.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the case of Apollo 8, the
lunar module
wasn't ready.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we decided to go around the
moon.

49:40.344 --> 49:45.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, they're thinking
about putting
astronauts on this flight maybe
early '19,

49:45.516 --> 49:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and send them around the moon
Apollo 8-style.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, a lot of things have lined
up.

49:49.820 --> 49:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, all of a sudden, there is
wide agreement
in the space community, this
might be the

49:53.891 --> 49:55.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next step.

49:55.793 --> 49:59.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling me, Miles,
there's a private sector piece
in all of this,

49:59.230 --> 50:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elon Musk announcing just the
other day that
two individuals, I guess, with
some extra

50:04.668 --> 50:05.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spending money...

50:05.669 --> 50:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: To say the least.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:08.472 --> 50:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... have told him
they want
to go around the moon and come
back to Earth.

50:09.306 --> 50:10.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

50:10.307 --> 50:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He got a lot of attention for
that.

50:11.408 --> 50:14.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't have a rocket to do
it yet.

50:14.044 --> 50:15.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a design right now.

50:15.880 --> 50:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's called the Falcon Heavy,
which would
have almost the thrust of the
mighty Saturn

50:20.017 --> 50:21.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
5 of Apollo days.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will fly for the first time,
he hopes,
by the summer.

50:24.889 --> 50:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So saying there are going to be
paying passengers
on there by '18 is optimistic,
for sure.

50:29.226 --> 50:31.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we will watch that with
skepticism.

50:31.195 --> 50:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to the extent that the
private sector
and the government space
enterprise sort of

50:35.666 --> 50:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
push each other toward this
destination, a
lot of space people are pretty
excited about

50:39.970 --> 50:41.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

50:41.772 --> 50:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, remind us,
Miles, why
was the moon -- it was on the
agenda at NASA

50:45.709 --> 50:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a while, but it came off.

50:47.244 --> 50:48.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was that all about?

50:48.245 --> 50:49.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Politics.

50:49.346 --> 50:52.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we lost the shuttle
Columbia in
'03.

50:52.216 --> 50:55.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bush at the time
canceled the shuttle
program and said, let's go back
to the moon,

50:55.219 --> 50:57.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a program called Constellation.

50:57.121 --> 50:59.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That got some traction.

50:59.089 --> 51:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, President
Obama came
in and said, we're not going to
the moon.

51:01.959 --> 51:03.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're going to Mars.

51:03.193 --> 51:04.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he wouldn't let anybody talk
about going
to the moon.

51:05.029 --> 51:08.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a lot of people who
said, you know,
we should try the moon first
before we move

51:08.432 --> 51:12.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
onto Mars, but that got shelved
during the
Obama administration.

51:12.236 --> 51:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politics now is different,
obviously, with
the Trump administration there.

51:15.439 --> 51:19.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I'm told the Trump
administration would
really like to have U.S.
astronauts taking

51:19.576 --> 51:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off from a U.S. spaceport some
time in its
first term.

51:23.347 --> 51:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this idea of turning that
unmanned
Space Launch System flight into
a crewed mission

51:28.953 --> 51:30.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is gaining a lot of traction.

51:30.387 --> 51:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Miles, there
is this question of money.

51:32.556 --> 51:35.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It costs money to go into space.

51:35.259 --> 51:40.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a president who has
talked about cutting
back domestic discretionary
spending.

51:40.698 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where's the money going to come
from?

51:41.699 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know, it's
interesting.

51:42.866 --> 51:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to look at the entire
space enterprise
here.

51:44.868 --> 51:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA's budget is a little more
than $19 billion,
but if you look at the budget
for the military

51:49.139 --> 51:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of space, it's about $40
billion.

51:51.475 --> 51:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what if they reconsider this
idea of a
space council, which they're
doing, headed

51:55.779 --> 52:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the vice president, and they
start looking
at ways to carve out and
eliminate some of

52:01.151 --> 52:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the redundancies between the
military and
the civilian side?

52:04.355 --> 52:09.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be some ways, even
with NASA cuts,
that they can borrow from each
other, feed

52:09.193 --> 52:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other technology, as it
were, military
and civilian, which could be a
bit of a force

52:14.064 --> 52:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
multiplier and could make it
still possible.

52:16.266 --> 52:19.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting,
because the president
has talked about spending a lot
more money

52:19.570 --> 52:20.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on defense.

52:20.571 --> 52:21.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that money might ultimately
help NASA.

52:23.107 --> 52:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles O'Brien,
taking us to
the moon and back, thank you.

52:26.777 --> 52:28.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: To the moon,
Alice.

52:28.112 --> 52:29.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:29.113 --> 52:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

52:30.447 --> 52:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

52:37.054 --> 52:44.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Aboriginal Australian art
is the oldest

52:44.595 --> 52:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continuous art tradition in the
world, stretching
back more than 40,000 years.

52:49.166 --> 52:55.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, due to a group of
passionate collectors
and curators, Aboriginal
Australian art shows

52:55.339 --> 52:57.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are popping up across the U.S.

52:57.574 --> 53:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

53:03.814 --> 53:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have lost another of the
greats in
public broadcasting.

53:07.317 --> 53:12.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longtime "Nightly Business
Report" co-anchor
Paul Kangas passed away
yesterday at the age

53:12.489 --> 53:14.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 79 in Miami.

53:14.558 --> 53:16.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul retired from the program in
2009.

53:16.693 --> 53:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an earlier era, The Detroit
Free Press
dubbed Paul the Walter Cronkite
of business

53:22.332 --> 53:24.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
broadcasting.

53:24.034 --> 53:28.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we all remember his
trademark sign-off,
"Wishing you the best of good
buys."

53:28.705 --> 53:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul was a true gentleman with a
great sense
of humor.

53:39.383 --> 53:40.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
