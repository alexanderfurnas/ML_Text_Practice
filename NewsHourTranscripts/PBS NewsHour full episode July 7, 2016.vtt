the police shooting of an
african-american man in
Minnesota and

10:13.246 --> 10:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the disturbing live video that
captured part of the aftermath
led to another day

10:17.383 --> 10:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of anger distress and serious
questions among them

10:21.821 --> 10:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why was lethal force used how
police respond to situations and
the growing

10:26.493 --> 10:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impact of video and social media
we explore this now with Jelani

10:48.848 --> 10:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jelani let me start with you
like thousands if not millions
of people

10:52.085 --> 10:54.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today you saw that video
your initial reactions

10:54.087 --> 10:57.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was just after Cara

10:59.626 --> 11:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was amazing thing to see
someone able to maintain their
composure and the face

11:05.798 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this is the most horrible
circumstance that we can imagine

11:10.169 --> 11:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to think this happened you
know just in the span of three
maybe 36 hours

11:15.475 --> 11:19.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the previous video of
someone who died in an incident
with the police

11:21.281 --> 11:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it honestly was a lot to process
it David clear your reaction of
the the

11:28.054 --> 11:30.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
video out of Minnesota is one of
the most compelling things I've
ever seen

11:32.158 --> 11:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I follow up with well what the
other gentleman just said about
trying to

11:36.663 --> 11:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process it in terms
of her composure

11:40.633 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that her daughter is
there her daughter comforting
her later on the

11:44.971 --> 11:48.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
video opening with the
the gentleman bleeding

11:48.708 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously being shot the officer
shouting it was very compelling
and very

11:52.812 --> 11:54.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disturbing

11:54.881 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David staying with you for a
second there are thousands if
not hundreds of

11:58.284 --> 12:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of traffic stops every
day and police around the
country figure out a

12:02.155 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to never get anything
to escalate to this level

12:06.225 --> 12:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's failing in these cases
what's the training on a basic
traffic stop

12:10.797 --> 12:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well basically walk up and
identify yourself as a police
officer asked for

12:16.069 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
driver's license registration
and then you move from there in
this situation as

12:19.372 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
i understand it

12:21.574 --> 12:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the driver told the officer that
he had a CCW permit to carry a
concealed weapon

12:27.013 --> 12:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permit and it devolved from
there and trying to understand
how it got to that

12:32.518 --> 12:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point is going to be the nub of
the investigation and because
the video

12:36.222 --> 12:39.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
starts after the shots
have been fired

12:39.659 --> 12:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't know what preceded it
and so I say we just need to
wait and see what

12:43.830 --> 12:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the rest of the evidence is
regarding what happened in terms
of

12:47.700 --> 12:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pulling the trigger is you wrote
today that this live streaming
was almost like

12:52.138 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a 911 call in the
context of police abuse

12:56.242 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure when you're on the other
side of police abuse / police
brutality or

12:59.579 --> 13:02.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police shootings you

13:02.081 --> 13:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't call the police which
is the natural instinct that
most people have

13:04.584 --> 13:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you're in an
emergency situation

13:07.854 --> 13:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so now social media has really
become this lifeline for people
it's not only

13:12.225 --> 13:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there to document it so we can
see what happened after the fact
but in that

13:16.696 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment in that video you can see
diamond Reynolds is really
calling out for help

13:19.666 --> 13:23.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that moment because she
doesn't know where else to turn

13:23.002 --> 13:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jelani that the idea that that
that woman was literally giving
out her

13:27.507 --> 13:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
address trying to get people to
come to her is this a sign that
there is a

13:31.310 --> 13:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vacuum in some way that law
enforcement agencies the
Department of Justice when

13:35.381 --> 13:39.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they do the Special
Investigations that there is
some sort of still a failure

13:39.085 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there that there cannot be that
accountability that someone can
turn to

13:42.955 --> 13:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly and you know we've
seen this again again again in
the kind of

13:47.960 --> 13:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
systemic way and you know to the
to the bigger . i think that's
here is also

13:51.531 --> 13:55.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something about the gun
culture of the United States

13:55.034 --> 14:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're in we've seen the response
to you know mass shootings and
the total sum of

14:02.108 --> 14:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homicides in this country and in
the face of that a really
recalcitrant

14:07.380 --> 14:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insistence upon a kind of
fundamentalist version of the
Second Amendment yet this

14:13.286 --> 14:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person was actually guilty of
nothing more than taking the 2nd
amendment at

14:16.989 --> 14:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
face value and identifying
himself as a registered weapon
holder and it results

14:23.096 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in him being killed fatally shot

14:27.133 --> 14:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so I think it sends a
message here that these IDs
principles really are not

14:30.536 --> 14:33.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made with us in mind
they don't apply to us

14:33.906 --> 14:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David cleaner you know governor
Mark Dayton even said out loud
today and and

14:38.244 --> 14:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you might have heard it in the
piece that preceded this
conversation is it

14:41.080 --> 14:44.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will basically what this have
happened if the driver and the
passenger was

14:44.350 --> 14:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white and the end and the
governor says no but what's the
training that police

14:48.221 --> 14:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have when it comes to racial
profiling something that the
whole country is

14:52.925 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sensitive about these days
there's a lot of training that's
been going on around

14:57.263 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country united states
department of justice is putting
on implicit by a

15:01.300 --> 15:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trick place I can talk excuse me

15:04.403 --> 15:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implicit bias training for all
federal agents as i understand
it and so it's

15:08.307 --> 15:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that is ongoing but i
would challenge the governor's
position he

15:12.678 --> 15:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows nothing about how the
situation one down he's not
privy to the

15:15.281 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investigative case file

15:18.017 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the investigation is still
ongoing and to say that it was a
racially based

15:22.221 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting we have no idea at this
point it may well be but we
don't know that at

15:26.325 --> 15:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this point and the evidence that
we do have in terms of the
statistics that we

15:30.096 --> 15:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have indicates that in fact the
majority of the people who were
killed across the

15:33.266 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country by United States police
officers are white people you
know it

15:37.670 --> 15:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David staying with also booked
sorry go ahead you're lying yeah

15:41.073 --> 15:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also that's misleading to frame
it that way certainly we should
be very

15:45.344 --> 15:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cognizant of the fact that the
majority of the people in this
country who were

15:47.180 --> 15:50.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
killed by police are white

15:50.283 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also the majority of the
population is why when you look
at this in terms of

15:54.086 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
population share a
proportionately smaller number
of my people than the

15:59.325 --> 16:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general population to kill about
police and a proportionately
higher portion of

16:02.595 --> 16:06.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people of color are
and that goals

16:06.032 --> 16:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to say kind of one
thing people will say
immediately is that well

16:09.268 --> 16:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the higher crime statistics
among people of color but even
when dealing with

16:13.172 --> 16:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unarmed individuals is still a
disproportionate number of
people of

16:17.243 --> 16:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color who were killed when you
look at their share of the
population

16:21.180 --> 16:23.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yeah according to the Washington
Post database to keep track of
this i think

16:23.983 --> 16:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last two years and
they've been tracking it they've
been 2.5 times as

16:26.419 --> 16:29.388 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
many African
Americans killed and

16:29.388 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as as white people are easy i
wanna i wanna bring this to you
just for a

16:33.926 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second I did the videos change
something to the nature of the
fact that when i

16:37.663 --> 16:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saw it last night I almost found
it impossible to believe that it
was true

16:42.501 --> 16:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then all of a sudden as it
was rolling out there were kind
of different

16:46.105 --> 16:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feelings that I was having I
think this video cuts really
deep

16:50.443 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean you have a man they're
dying in the in the driver's
seat you have his

16:54.680 --> 16:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
girlfriend's sitting next to him
suffering you have the police
officer

16:58.117 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yelling out these barbaric
screams you have a little
four-year-old girl who

17:01.187 --> 17:03.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just witnessed a murder

17:03.389 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suddenly comforting her mother
it's impossible not to be
sympathetic

17:07.360 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so there's a lot of conversation
about whether these videos
should immediately

17:11.130 --> 17:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be published and I think that
that's a that's we have to
decide as a society

17:15.968 --> 17:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether we you know want to
protect these sort of delicate
sensibilities we

17:19.939 --> 17:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have or if we want to let these
stories be shared in full side
of the story that

17:24.277 --> 17:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
historically has not really been
shown and the value of social
media has always

17:28.848 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been allowing people to go
direct to the public and sort of
sidestep the

17:33.119 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainstream media and I think
that's exactly what we saw here
so yes I do you

17:35.354 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think it's changing things

17:37.657 --> 17:41.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jelani what about the
possibility of a desensitizing
effect just the fact that

17:41.060 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're talking about two videos
and such short succession over
time does it

17:45.331 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
become almost like a drum beat
and ultimately does it change
the equation

17:49.502 --> 17:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well i don't know i think that
you know one thing that happens
with this is that

17:54.340 --> 18:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many communities have talked
about this and will not believe
so at the very

18:00.746 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least we now have some sort of
documentary evidence of what is
actually

18:04.984 --> 18:10.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happening and as far as
desensitizing I mean the
majority population has been

18:10.222 --> 18:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
desensitized to the suffering of
this community for since the
inception of

18:14.226 --> 18:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country and so I don't
think that this is going to
somehow another make

18:18.297 --> 18:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone who was concerned about
these issues kind of look
askance and say that

18:21.934 --> 18:24.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can no longer

18:24.270 --> 18:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compliments what's happening
David klinger video seems to be
a reality that

18:29.375 --> 18:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every Police Department has to
deal with whether it's the video
coming out of

18:33.346 --> 18:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their body cameras and how those
body cameras are protected and
the chain of

18:36.515 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
custody on where that video is
throughout the entire process or
as we

18:39.618 --> 18:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now see more often than not

18:42.989 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the initial moment of the
incident someone a bystander or
in this case part

18:48.160 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the victims are actually
turning to social media to turn
this on so how

18:52.965 --> 18:56.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to police departments around the
country kind of brace for this
prepare for this

18:56.936 --> 19:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what they should do is they
should be telling all their
officers to assume

19:02.041 --> 19:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're being videoed even
if you are not wearing a body
camera you don't

19:05.711 --> 19:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an in-car video that's
working and - uh therefore act
appropriately just as

19:11.517 --> 19:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another check to remind officers
to the to do the right thing one
of the things

19:15.388 --> 19:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's frustrating to me is
there still some police agencies
out there that

19:18.624 --> 19:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't understand that citizens
have an absolute lawful right to
go ahead and

19:22.995 --> 19:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video and audio record them
when they're in public space

19:26.699 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only issue is that we have
to negotiate or or explain to
people what

19:31.771 --> 19:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rule set is going to be
about not interfering and I
think that that's the

19:35.641 --> 19:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next thing that people are
going to have to understand
there's a time and a

19:38.611 --> 19:41.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place to step back
and take that video

19:41.247 --> 19:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you shouldn't be introducing
yourself into the event itself

19:45.084 --> 19:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've got friends for police
officers who say that a a
sizeable number of times

19:50.189 --> 19:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they get out of their
vehicle a crowd will surround
them and try to egg

19:54.093 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them on so that they can get a
better a clip to put up on
YouTube and so I think

19:58.864 --> 20:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to have to figure
some stuff out here but police
agency should not be

20:02.535 --> 20:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worried about the fact that the
public is monitoring them with
video and audio

20:04.370 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recordings

20:06.505 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

so much for

20:11.610 --> 20:14.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joining us thank you
thank you thank you

20:14.713 --> 20:17.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

20:27.259 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we turn now to another
high-profile story of this day
where the US justice

20:31.564 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system is being questioned
but for different reasons

20:35.067 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said they are dad has that
Republicans today opened a new
stage in

20:41.974 --> 20:46.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the debate over Hillary
Clinton's emails with the house
oversight committee I'd

20:46.712 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say I'm here because we were
mystified and Confused
immediately Republican

20:52.251 --> 20:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chairman jason Chaffetz of Utah
challenge FBI director James
Comey over

20:57.022 --> 21:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether the Bureau has not
Quentin off easy that the
average Joe the average

21:01.760 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American that if they had done
what you laid out in your
statement that they'd

21:07.032 --> 21:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be in handcuffs and they might
be on their way to jail and we
probably should

21:10.736 --> 21:15.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and I think there is a
legitimate concern that there is
a double standard

21:15.207 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but over five hours of testimony

21:19.178 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call me insisted his agency was
right to recommend more charges
the

21:23.415 --> 21:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recommendation was made the way
you would want it to be by
people who didn't

21:27.186 --> 21:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
give a hoot about politics but
who cared about what are the
facts

21:30.589 --> 21:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is the law and how have
similar people all people been
treated in the

21:33.926 --> 21:35.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past

21:35.761 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other Republicans like South
Carolina's trey Gowdy press the
FBI chief on

21:39.832 --> 21:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether Clinton's previous
statements about the emails were
true

21:43.536 --> 21:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton said i did not
email any classified material to
anyone on my

21:47.573 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
email there is no classified
material was that true that
there was classified

21:50.543 --> 21:53.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material email

21:53.012 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton said all
work-related emails will return
to the State

21:55.948 --> 21:58.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Department was that true

21:58.284 --> 22:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no we found work-related emails
thousands that were not returned

22:02.655 --> 22:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's better for me homie argued
that what Quintin did may well
have been

22:06.091 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worth some kind of punishment
but we're not prosecution as a
climb

22:10.329 --> 22:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so should have known must have
known had to know does not get
you there

22:14.466 --> 22:17.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that they knew
they were engaged in

22:17.836 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that was unlawful for
you drew a distinction with a
similar case that

22:21.607 --> 22:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of General David Petraeus who
agreed to a plea deal in 20 15 /
mishandling

22:26.412 --> 22:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classified information in that
case of obstruction of justice

22:31.550 --> 22:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have intentional misconduct
and a vast quantity of
information

22:34.753 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he admitted he knew that
was the wrong thing to do

22:38.090 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is a perfect illustration
of a kind of cases to get
prosecuted

22:41.927 --> 22:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while Republicans argued that
the lack of charges was
political three Democrats

22:46.398 --> 22:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contended the politics were all
in the hearing itself despite
your impeccable

22:50.002 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
reputation for
independence and integrity

22:54.873 --> 22:59.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans have turned
on you with a vengeance

22:59.545 --> 23:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediately after you announced
your recommendation not to
pursue criminal

23:05.317 --> 23:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges against Secretary
Clinton Hillary Clinton stayed
off the campaign

23:10.623 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trail today but her press
secretary sent out a statement
saying

23:14.426 --> 23:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's hearing knockdown
Republican falsehoods and shut
the door on

23:17.796 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conspiracy theories about
the emails once and for all

23:21.834 --> 23:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but House Speaker Paul Ryan
believes the case is not closed
right now there are

23:26.972 --> 23:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still far more questions than
answers regarding the
investigation of Secretary

23:31.543 --> 23:35.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Clinton the nation's top

tonight our series fault

23:54.767 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

24:02.875 --> 24:07.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today estonian say they need no

fears about a

24:07.179 --> 24:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resurgent Russia are the highest
since the country gained
independence when the

24:38.610 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

forties

25:03.102 --> 25:07.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so we're looking at a series of
old radios hear me and my father
we were

25:07.840 --> 25:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

a virgin america that reached
out behind the Iron

25:13.245 --> 25:16.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could when you look
at today's Russia

25:16.382 --> 25:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do you see echoes of what
we are looking at around us

25:19.952 --> 25:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I remember the joy when we
regained our independence

25:24.757 --> 25:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the message is clear we are
going to defend our liberties
our country and our

25:30.362 --> 25:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to defend the country all

five thousand active
duty soldiers

25:38.036 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

century of looking elsewhere

27:37.789 --> 27:42.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NATO's we focused on its
original enemy I started this 27

his troops are deployed in half
a dozen countries behind and
what has changed

27:56.642 --> 27:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last 27 years is that
there are nations now in eastern
and central

27:59.511 --> 28:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
europe that have volunteered
to join an alliance

28:03.448 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after Crimea estonia invited the
us to deploy a hundred and fifty
soldiers and

28:08.387 --> 28:10.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hold increasingly large

28:13.559 --> 28:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow it will announce the

unit to Estonia is

28:18.764 --> 28:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that commitment of a unified
alliance with 28 nations that is
what deters

28:25.604 --> 28:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but after britain voted to leave
the European Union Estonians
worry about

28:29.041 --> 28:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European fortitude and they fear
the possible impact of
presidential

28:32.578 --> 28:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate Donald Trump many
countries are not paying their
fair share

28:35.948 --> 28:40.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that means we are protecting
them and they are getting all
sorts of military

28:40.118 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protection and other things and
they're ripping off the United
States and

28:44.089 --> 28:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're ripping you off Trump's
criticism is economic in the

nineteen eighties the u.s.
accounted for half NATO members
military budgets today

28:51.630 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the u.s. accounts for three
quarters of those budgets

28:55.067 --> 29:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either they pay up including for
past deficiencies or they have
to get out and

29:01.206 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if it breaks up NATO it breaks
up NATO we cannot allow this
very successful

29:06.979 --> 29:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliance to fall apart because
in one case we don't want to do
anything

well Thomas &lt;operand> fifty
&lt;/operand> Elvis has been
estonia's president for

29:14.353 --> 29:16.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearly a decade

29:16.788 --> 29:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO's article 5 says if estonia
wherever attacked the United
States and

29:20.926 --> 29:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every NATO country would be
obliged to go to war with
estonia's attacker

29:25.030 --> 29:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if that political will is
missing in one case then the
entire enterprise falls

29:30.369 --> 29:32.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
apart

29:32.337 --> 29:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why should Americans who are
skeptical about spending money
on the military and

29:36.775 --> 29:38.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other places

29:38.477 --> 29:42.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care about stuff so i
bought the American values

29:42.280 --> 29:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is important for the better
world in the future that Estonia
stays free and

29:47.285 --> 29:52.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
democratic country into
democracy spread east from here
instead of vice versa the

29:52.157 --> 29:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tyranny spreading west from here

29:54.926 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why is this important that you
are training for this threat if
we continue

30:00.032 --> 30:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sit back and watch one tree
fall and another country for
another good for

30:03.969 --> 30:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never taking all of Europe and
now it's literally the only
thing you have left

30:06.872 --> 30:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the US but now they have all
the resources of all those other
countries

30:10.375 --> 30:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's it's a dangerous mind set
to be passive and to sit back

30:14.079 --> 30:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Estonians argue unlike the vast
majority of NATO members they
meet the military

30:18.083 --> 30:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending requirements and when
the Alliance is called they've
answered

30:23.188 --> 30:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
article 5 has been invoked once
and that was by the united
states and that was in

30:29.695 --> 30:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the wake of 911 in which we went
to Afghanistan we were smack in
the middle

30:37.703 --> 30:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Taliban land so we did it we
did our duty is the end of that
sentence that

30:43.275 --> 30:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you came to the United States is
aid you would expect United
States come near it

30:48.113 --> 30:53.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we fulfilled our NATO
obligations and you'd expect
made out of will fill

there's back in north along the

31:05.163 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when you come up here

31:08.967 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you see this view what do you
think 14 year old Eagle sure is
the son of a

31:13.705 --> 31:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian mother and estonian
father were like pretty much
have almost the same

31:18.043 --> 31:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
culture like a stone and Russia
from the castle there is no sign
of tension

31:23.915 --> 31:26.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Igor and much of this town wants
to keep it that way these
provocations from both

31:26.551 --> 31:29.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both sides

31:29.721 --> 31:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are pretty much useless
because it's just amazing
detention even more

31:33.592 --> 31:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's because nervous feels
calm and Estonians have it
pretty good

31:38.230 --> 31:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they make more money and the
Russian neighbors children can
work across the

31:42.601 --> 31:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EU that stability and prosperity
keeps even Russian speaking
residents

31:46.571 --> 31:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pro-european will go this region
economically it's quite well off
and

31:50.142 --> 31:52.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
self-sufficient

31:52.277 --> 31:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judging by the office of 62
year old Vladimir Petrov

31:55.347 --> 31:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's a Russian nationalists
you have the magnets

31:59.184 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Putin we have Stalin but
in the have the newspaper

32:03.922 --> 32:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it seems like you're pro-russian
when i receive older people
they're familiar

32:06.691 --> 32:08.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with all this

32:08.460 --> 32:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's very dear to them it
makes them feel at home

32:12.164 --> 32:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is the chairman of the union
of Russian citizens in estonia
but even he

32:16.168 --> 32:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants his love of Russia to
remain a long distance
relationship as you said

32:21.139 --> 32:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia could very quickly come
in with the people of novel
welcome that the

32:26.178 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
daily life here that's
continuing is nothing like
military intervention and

32:29.281 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no one is hoping for that

32:32.083 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so estonia's deterrence is our
economic enlargement and
military might

32:36.454 --> 32:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for both to work they need a
robust european union and nato
without those

33:00.912 --> 33:03.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

stay with us coming up on the

two weeks in britain since the
country voted to

33:22.968 --> 33:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave the European Union the
pound dropped to its lowest
levels in more

33:27.272 --> 33:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than three decades and the
european markets have taken hits
over concerns

33:31.776 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the economic impact
tonight we get a longer view and
a less alarmed one

33:37.482 --> 33:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what it means for global
banking and financial stability

correspondent Paul Solman filed

it's part of his weekly

the world banking system hasn't
reformed

eight years after its excesses
led to collapse times the Old
Man River Britain

34:07.112 --> 34:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we'll be here forever rather
like money and banking we've
always had them as it

34:09.514 --> 34:11.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happened

34:11.483 --> 34:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was giving me a tour of
London to make his case on the
day of the brexit

34:15.487 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote the oddsmakers the markets
and I at least thought Britain
would remain

34:24.329 --> 34:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as we passed a group
of upbeat remainders

34:28.033 --> 34:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought no problem counting is
underway of tens of millions of
votes

34:32.337 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then came the result the
answer is we're out

34:38.810 --> 34:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so before asking you to take the
tour we check back with King to
see if the vote

34:43.682 --> 34:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had altered his analysis we
didn't talk much about the
brakes vote because it

34:47.852 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually the brakes it vote
isn't germane to the fundamental
challenges

34:51.823 --> 34:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing with our banking system
and putting on to a sound
footing

34:56.161 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were talking as we walked
around London about the really
important long

run issues affecting our
economist look King says when
you take the long view

35:04.302 --> 35:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the global financial system
needs the same fixes it did
before break sir

35:09.474 --> 35:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he believes his tour of London
finance therefore is as relevant
as ever

35:17.315 --> 35:19.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Badgers great book

35:19.351 --> 35:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the eighteen seventies about

35:21.953 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how to ensure that the
banking crisis don't occur

35:24.422 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have to respond to

35:26.825 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and this was the place where
finance houses were situated

35:30.395 --> 35:32.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a coffee houses which
turned into banks

35:32.397 --> 35:34.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and trading house

35:34.499 --> 35:38.136 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and the heart of
the city of london

35:38.136 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his idea was the people who
worked here we just better walk
across the

35:40.939 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
street to the magma

35:43.174 --> 35:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives the security of the
collapsible they had to the main
convenient bank

35:46.611 --> 35:50.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would lend the money
that rush back pal

35:50.281 --> 35:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the creditors and depositors
they wanted their money back
central banks exist to

35:54.185 --> 36:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be lenders of last resort
problem too big to fail and
that's what began

36:00.191 --> 36:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening in England just like
America in the eighties and
nineties

36:04.362 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here we are now in the modern
Docklands area so this is where
the banks came to

36:09.100 --> 36:14.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trade for the derivative
instruments of CDO squared all
the complex instruments

36:14.572 --> 36:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were traded down here and
is a large part of the problem
that

36:18.643 --> 36:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crystallized aggressive way
because people like yourself

36:22.881 --> 36:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bank of England the fed in the
United States couldn't keep up
with the

36:27.285 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innovation it was going on in
places like this i will put it
differently i

36:30.989 --> 36:34.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think there were two
things that were going on

36:34.492 --> 36:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one was that because interest
rates were falling throughout
the world

36:39.130 --> 36:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asset prices were rising trading
look very profitable and
therefore the

36:44.202 --> 36:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leverage of the banking system

36:47.172 --> 36:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rose very sharply leverage
meaning the ratio of the bank's
own money to the

36:52.644 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money it borrows in the form of
deposits or short term loans so
that made the

36:56.481 --> 36:59.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
banking system or fragile

36:59.317 --> 37:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other thing was that what
proved very difficult and it is
always going to

37:02.987 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be very difficult is the
businesses or particular methods
and financial

37:07.459 --> 37:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
services that keep making
money year after year

37:11.129 --> 37:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are they making money because
they just good ideas and a very
successful or are

37:15.366 --> 37:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they making money because
they're very risky and I just on
the edge but people

37:18.770 --> 37:21.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
must have realized that
was happening so how come

37:21.673 --> 37:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regulation didn't adapt to
the changing environment

37:26.511 --> 37:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's easy with hindsight to look
back and say all these
regulations turned out

37:30.682 --> 37:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be inadequate because it
turned out the mortgage loan

37:34.552 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for example was riskier than was
thought beforehand but that's
the problem of

37:38.656 --> 37:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinking in advance that you've
got a detail system that works
and then you

37:42.961 --> 37:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think all that will work then
you discover it doesn't and you
do need

37:46.598 --> 37:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something much more robust and
much more simple to prevent I
think the same

37:50.135 --> 37:52.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
problem happening again

37:52.137 --> 37:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so King has two proposals for
preventing another breath

37:55.773 --> 38:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so this now is the Bank of
England this is the building
which has been the home

38:00.612 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the central bank sincerely
18th century and this is where
you were in

38:04.149 --> 38:06.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008

38:06.518 --> 38:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yes I was on the ground floor
because the governor's office is
on the ground

38:08.419 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
floor

38:11.256 --> 38:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this is where the banks will
come in to meet with us
regularly and when they

38:15.593 --> 38:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came in to say we need a lot of
money and the whole point of
your book is to

38:21.266 --> 38:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make sure that we don't have

38:24.235 --> 38:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as frequent or is damaging
banking crisis as we saw in 2008
King's first

38:29.941 --> 38:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proposal is that banks insure
themselves against catastrophe

38:34.512 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by making enough safe secure
loans so they have assets of
real value to pledge

38:40.185 --> 38:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the central bank if they need
a cash infusion in a hurry so
that when there

38:45.089 --> 38:49.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is a run on the bank and
depositors lose confidence for
whatever reason it is

38:49.761 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perfectly acceptable for the
central bank to pay the cash to
the banking

38:53.531 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system as a short-term line king
second proposal is also simple
force the banks

38:59.204 --> 39:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to keep enough cash on hand
to cover loans gone bad

39:03.708 --> 39:07.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thanks did not have
enough equity finance

39:07.579 --> 39:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so when you say equity you mean
the cushion of the the bank's
own money

39:12.584 --> 39:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know the shareholders own
funds which are available to be
able to absorb

39:18.122 --> 39:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losses without defaulting on the
loans which banks have taken out
whether from

39:24.395 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other bits of the financial
sector or from you and eyes
depositors when a bank

39:28.533 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fails to would be able to return
money to its depositors or other
people from

39:33.104 --> 39:35.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is borrowed

39:35.306 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the bank fails and you get
into a problem of potential
development

39:39.310 --> 39:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last question i asked King
the day of the brexit vote was
this in how much

39:43.214 --> 39:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
danger is the world banking
system at the moment

39:46.217 --> 39:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a scale of one to ten I add
so depends on the time scale i
think in

39:51.089 --> 39:54.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of the current immediate
problems in only three four five

39:57.228 --> 39:59.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but if you say to me do I think
we're going to avoid a serious
problem in the

39:59.664 --> 40:02.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next decade

40:02.267 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I think the answer is
probably not that it's much more
like seven or eight

40:05.770 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and does he still get the same
scores now that the UK has voted
to exit the EU

40:11.109 --> 40:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think the vote makes any
significant difference to the
risks

40:13.911 --> 40:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
facing the global banking system

40:17.181 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were and are significant
risks in that system because of
the potential

40:21.686 --> 40:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fragility of our banks and
because of the state of the
world economy but I

40:26.524 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really don't think that the
brakes it vote itself really
makes any significant

40:30.428 --> 40:33.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difference as he adds it may not
make any significant difference
to the

40:33.564 --> 40:36.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long-term future of
Europe's economies

40:36.634 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despite the chopped in the
currency and stock markets at
the moment

40:40.638 --> 40:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Economist have a habit of
being pretty resilient in the
longer run when

40:44.609 --> 40:47.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people and countries want to
trade with each other they find
ways to do so and

40:47.845 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
i'm sure that will happen now

40:50.315 --> 40:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is economics correspondent
Paul Solman reporting from the
UK and now

40:53.518 --> 40:55.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from back in the US of A

41:06.998 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now a new documentary lays out a
sobering view about the use of

41:12.737 --> 41:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cyberwarfare a future that's
accelerated since intelligence
agencies sabotage

41:16.841 --> 41:19.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iran's nuclear program

41:19.811 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the film called zero days opens
in more than a dozen cities
tomorrow and will be

41:23.815 --> 41:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
available online its director
stop by as part of the recent
AFI docs festival

41:29.721 --> 41:35.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
jeffrey Brown has our
conversation the 2010 cyber
attack on an Iranian nuclear

41:35.393 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facility dub Stuxnet the first
question was what exactly was
this sophisticated

41:38.596 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapon

41:40.898 --> 41:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the second who created and
carried it out and in the years
since many new

41:44.969 --> 41:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions have arisen about
cyber warfare and the new world
we live in the

41:49.474 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new documentary 0 days post
together what happened with
Stuxnet and since

41:53.378 --> 41:56.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alex give me academy
award-winning documentary maker
of numerous films

41:56.814 --> 41:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joins me now welcome to you

41:59.717 --> 42:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thank you why was this is
subject you wanted to tackle it
seemed like it was a

42:04.055 --> 42:09.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story that this was was about
the internet and the
militarization of the

42:09.160 --> 42:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
internet was not properly
understood and I certainly
didn't understand it so it

42:12.430 --> 42:14.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
may be want to dig in

42:14.732 --> 42:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remind us briefly what Stuxnet
was and how you figured out a
way to to capture

42:18.436 --> 42:20.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

42:20.438 --> 42:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stuxnet was a piece of malware
that was a self-replicating so
it didn't you

42:26.778 --> 42:30.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't have to click on it in
order to cause it to spread from
computer to

42:30.114 --> 42:35.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computer but it was unique in
the sense that it crossed the
threshold from the

42:35.686 --> 42:40.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cyber realm to the physical
realm and it was introduced into
the Iranian nuclear

42:40.358 --> 42:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facility and the tones and it
took over the machines there
that control the

42:44.729 --> 42:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
centrifuges and cause the
centrifuges to spin wildly out
of control until they

42:47.999 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blew up

42:50.435 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but interestingly it had an
ocean's 11 kind of component
which then relayed a

42:54.672 --> 42:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
message to the engineers that
all was well so it's so
tremendous doubt in the

42:59.076 --> 43:01.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minds of the people at the tones
so there's the beginning first
part of your

43:01.979 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
film is this detective story

43:05.049 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you go to cybersecurity experts
and i want to show one clip
we're two of them

43:09.487 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are sort of trying to figure out
what it is and where it might be
what it might

43:13.257 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be aimed

43:14.992 --> 43:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's look at that it spread to
any windows machine in the
entire world

43:19.030 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know we had these
organizations inside the united
states were in charge

43:22.667 --> 43:26.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of industrial control
facilities same were infected

43:26.437 --> 43:30.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's gonna happen we didn't
know if there was a deadline
coming up where

43:30.708 --> 43:34.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this threat would trigger and
suddenly were like turn off all
you know an

43:34.378 --> 43:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
electricity plants around the
world or it would start shutting
things down or

43:36.614 --> 43:39.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
launching some attack

43:39.617 --> 43:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we knew that sucks there could
have very dire consequences and
we were very

43:44.188 --> 43:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worried about what the payload
contained and there was an
imperative speed that

43:48.759 --> 43:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have to race and try and
you repeat this ticking bomb

43:53.264 --> 43:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eventually we're able to find
this discs a little bit more
solid around was the

43:57.602 --> 44:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number one infected country in
the world that immediately
raised our eyebrows

44:02.406 --> 44:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have never seen a threat
before where was predominantly
in i rap how you

44:06.344 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
capture something
like this right there

44:09.113 --> 44:11.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these aren't these are bombs
that go boom these are things we
can't see this

44:11.916 --> 44:14.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the digital world

44:14.685 --> 44:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we had three approaches that
really helped us tell the story
one is we had

44:18.723 --> 44:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to detectives it became a
detective story and our two
detectors were the

44:22.126 --> 44:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cybersecurity as experts from
symantec and they let us through
the the weaponry

44:27.665 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
step at a time and so it
revealed things like a detective
story

44:31.569 --> 44:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- we work in partnership with a
great special effects and
graphics company

44:36.774 --> 44:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called frame store our main
character is a piece of code but
we made it live and

44:42.113 --> 44:45.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
breathe is if you're inside and
we used elements of the real
code so it's a

44:45.616 --> 44:49.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hundred percent accurate
terms of how we portrayed it

44:49.587 --> 44:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last thing was we did have a
number of people who came
forward to reveal

44:54.325 --> 44:58.029 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
information that
it was classified

44:58.029 --> 45:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was a kind of a shocking
nature in order to protect their
identity we came

45:02.300 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up with a means of a kind of
cyber generated character

45:07.038 --> 45:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yeah who spoke their words

45:12.577 --> 45:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the running themes
throughout the film is of course
secrecy

45:16.647 --> 45:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't answer that question
unfortunately i can't come and I
don't

45:18.883 --> 45:21.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know how to answer that

45:21.252 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two answers before you get
started I don't know and if I
did we wouldn't talk

45:23.688 --> 45:25.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about anyway

45:25.957 --> 45:29.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no one wants to talk about that
that's right and then and that's
the nature of

45:29.493 --> 45:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this kind of a new weapons
system that you are up against

45:33.397 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it goes beyond I mean we
can all accept a certain amount
of secrecy

45:37.234 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
particularly when you're
protecting agents in the field
and when human life

45:40.538 --> 45:42.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is at stake

45:42.840 --> 45:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think in the case of cyber
weapons we have a whole new
generation of

45:47.078 --> 45:52.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons it's a whole new kind of
warfare that's being practiced
in the field both

45:52.049 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by us and against us and yet
we're not allowed to talk about
them people at a

45:57.021 --> 46:02.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very high level won't even admit
that there was a Stuxnet that
the US and

46:02.793 --> 46:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel were involved and thirdly
that we're using these offensive
cyber

46:07.265 --> 46:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons routinely and that they
are also being used on us that
it seemed to me

46:09.934 --> 46:12.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a really big problem

46:12.036 --> 46:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some people would argue i
think that the program

46:15.406 --> 46:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stuxnet in particular achieved
its purpose at least in the
sense of

46:18.909 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bringing Iran to the
negotiating table

46:22.046 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stuxnet worm did accomplish
a very targeted short-term goal
but in its

46:29.453 --> 46:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
release and we tell the story of
how and why it was released into
the world

46:33.658 --> 46:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it started a new arms race that
has destabilized the world that
it was

46:39.096 --> 46:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intended to secure and to that
end in the last part of your
film you have

46:44.301 --> 46:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
various experts talking about
the potential uses against us of
these cyber

46:49.040 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weapons how fearful

46:52.109 --> 46:57.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in other words are you after
watching as well I'm fearful
because i don't think

46:57.214 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the current administration
or the previous administration
have taken

47:01.886 --> 47:06.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seriously than enough the need
for a kind of international
regulatory system

47:06.791 --> 47:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way we have with nuclear
weapons and furthermore they
seem to be emphasizing

47:10.361 --> 47:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deterrence through off ense
secret offense rather than
defense and they're

47:16.267 --> 47:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not telling us about the dangers
you know recently for example
there was a

47:21.906 --> 47:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shutdown of the Ukrainian
electrical grid

47:25.810 --> 47:30.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a big part of it and we're
pretty sure that it was the
result of Russian

47:30.147 --> 47:36.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
malware a kind of new hyper of
version of of a Stuxnet well
that could happen

47:36.787 --> 47:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at any time with us and nobody
is more vulnerable than we are
because we're so

47:41.392 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
deeply connected via the
internet it's particularly
disquieting because we're

47:45.329 --> 47:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not allowed to talk about the
new film talks about it 0 days

47:50.201 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alex Gibney thank you
very much thank you

48:04.749 --> 48:10.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
next to our brief but
spectacular series where
interesting people talk about

48:10.154 --> 48:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their passions tonight we hear
from actor and comedian Jim
Gaffigan

48:15.259 --> 48:19.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he's the star of the Jim
Gaffigan show which airs sunday
nights at 10pm on the

48:19.063 --> 48:21.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TV Land channel

48:21.766 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has become one of the most
universally appreciated voices
working

48:25.870 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in comedy today Gaffigan speaks
to us now about where his
observational

48:30.107 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
storytelling began

48:33.611 --> 48:36.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's the most common thing
people say you on the street are
you Brad pet

48:43.387 --> 48:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was raised to seek security

48:48.793 --> 48:53.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my parents were children during
the Depression and security was
wearing a

48:53.564 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coat and tie

48:55.833 --> 49:00.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the irony is that my brothers
and sisters that are bankers
have less job

49:00.070 --> 49:03.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
security than me and I
tell diarrhea jokes

49:03.641 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew probably similar to how
somebody when they first tried
heroin

49:08.045 --> 49:12.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is PBS by the way they know
that their life has been changed
and that's

49:12.449 --> 49:15.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how I felt when I was on
stage making fun of myself

49:17.488 --> 49:21.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand up comedy has changed
dramatically with the success of
Comedy Central and

49:21.525 --> 49:23.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
YouTube

49:23.894 --> 49:27.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I started there were people
that were comedians but there
were much more

49:27.598 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a riff raff of society like
the people that really couldn't
afford

49:30.467 --> 49:33.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
therapy went in to stand up

49:33.737 --> 49:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was kind of an oddity being
this suburban college educated
kit now I

49:39.410 --> 49:44.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think the norm is that many
comedians are college-educated
suburban kids

49:44.548 --> 49:48.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
essentially the diversity of
comedy has been ruined any
creative person will

49:48.752 --> 49:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell you that you're supposed to
write about things that you're
passionate

49:51.856 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about or you're embarrassed
about food is a very passionate
and embarrassing

49:56.527 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing for me and it's also
universal and everyone eats

50:01.999 --> 50:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean I just eat a lot more
than other people I curse in
everyday life but i'm

50:05.536 --> 50:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to curse in front
of a room full of people

50:08.806 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's not how I kind of

50:11.308 --> 50:15.312 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I feel empowered
by shocking people

50:15.312 --> 50:21.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I I feel empowered by telling
them about Jesus no I feel
empowered by making

50:21.151 --> 50:22.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people laugh

50:22.953 --> 50:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think a lot of observational
humor comes from annoyance

50:27.024 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why should we make our bed you
don't tire shoes after we take
them off

50:30.628 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why are we dragging a tree into
our living room in December like
a drunk

50:34.598 --> 50:36.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person

50:36.367 --> 50:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human beings are a rather
compliant species so we go along
with things that

50:41.572 --> 50:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after some thought we might
realize our kind of silly

50:45.910 --> 50:52.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my name is jim gaffigan and this
is my brief but spectacular take
on being a

50:52.249 --> 50:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comedian and you can find more
from our brief but spectacular
series on our

that's at pbs.org / news hour /
brief and now an update to
tonight's lead

51:05.496 --> 51:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story President Obama has just
made a statement on the police
shootings of

51:08.699 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
black suspects in
Minnesota and Louisiana

51:12.469 --> 51:14.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he spoke after arriving in
warsaw poland for a NATO summit

51:16.040 --> 51:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when incidents like this occur

51:19.977 --> 51:33.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a big chunk of our
fellow citizen ree that fields
as if because of

51:33.390 --> 51:39.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the color of their skin they are
not being treated the same and
that hurts

51:43.801 --> 51:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that should trouble all of
us this is not just a black
issue

51:50.240 --> 51:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's not just in Spanish issue
