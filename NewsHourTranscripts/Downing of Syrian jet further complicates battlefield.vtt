JUDY WOODRUFF: The downing of
a Syrian air force fighter jet
by an American strike aircraft

00:07.266 --> 00:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is just the latest
flash point that perhaps
signals a deepening
American involvement in

00:13.133 --> 00:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syria's many-sided civil war.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: America's
top military commander,
Marine General Joseph
Dunford, made no apology

00:24.533 --> 00:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today for Sunday's downing
of a Syrian warplane.

00:27.266 --> 00:29.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

00:29.366 --> 00:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH DUNFORD, Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman: We made every
effort to warn those individuals

00:31.366 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to come any closer, and then
the commander made a judgment
that there was a threat to

00:37.333 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the forces that we were
supporting and took action.

00:39.333 --> 00:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only actions that we
have taken against pro-regime
forces in Syria, and there have

00:43.166 --> 00:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been two specific incidents,
have been in self-defense.

00:46.033 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Earlier this month,
the U.S. struck pro-Assad
forces approaching an important

00:50.700 --> 00:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
U.S.-British special
forces base in At Tanf
in Southeastern Syria.

00:58.133 --> 01:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response to Sunday's
shoot-down, Russia,
which backs Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad,

01:02.866 --> 01:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said it now considers all U.S.
aircraft in the region a threat.

01:07.133 --> 01:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, the Defense
Ministry said: "All flying
objects, including planes and

01:14.100 --> 01:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drones of the international
coalition, detected west of the
Euphrates will be followed by

01:18.366 --> 01:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian air defense
systems as targets."

01:21.900 --> 01:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia also said it suspended
a military hot line with the
U.S. designed to coordinate

01:26.633 --> 01:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air missions in the region.

01:29.166 --> 01:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov called for dialogue.

01:32.066 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
We call on everybody to avoid

01:35.800 --> 01:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unilateral actions, to
respect, I stress once
again, Syria's sovereignty.

01:40.333 --> 01:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Pentagon
said it's repositioning
jets over Syria to ensure
the safety of American

01:46.366 --> 01:47.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
air crews.

01:47.933 --> 01:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All this further complicates the
already messy picture in Syria.

01:51.900 --> 01:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent weeks, U.S.
forces have ramped up
airstrikes to back the
so-called Syrian Democratic

01:58.800 --> 02:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forces, or SDF, a rebel
coalition battling ISIS around
its stronghold in Raqqa.

02:04.633 --> 02:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian President Assad, backed
by Russia, has used jets to
support pro-regime groups

02:09.500 --> 02:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the same area.

02:11.533 --> 02:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Said to be battling ISIS,
those fighters have also
clashed with the SDF.

02:17.766 --> 02:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Further complicating matters,
Iran's supports for Assad.

02:20.366 --> 02:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yesterday, Iran's
military launched its own
missile strike on ISIS
positions, in retaliation

02:27.166 --> 02:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the group's attack
in Tehran two weeks ago.

02:30.033 --> 02:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

02:32.866 --> 02:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more
on yesterday's shoot-down,
and the wider picture of a
very complex battlefield,

02:38.933 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Andrew Exum.

02:41.133 --> 02:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Middle
East policy from 2015 to 2016,

02:47.633 --> 02:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is now a contributing
editor at "The Atlantic."

02:50.433 --> 02:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Faysal Itani, he's a senior
fellow in the Rafik Hariri
Center for the Middle East

02:56.200 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the Atlantic Council.

02:57.466 --> 02:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Washington think tank.

02:58.900 --> 03:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, gentlemen, thank
you both for joining us.

03:01.066 --> 03:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a complicated
battlefield we're talking about.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Faysal Itani, I'm going
to start with you.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given that, was this inevitable
that this was going to happen,
or should the U.S. been

03:10.100 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to avoid it?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI, Atlantic Council's
Rafik Hariri Center for the
Middle East: Well, I think

03:14.100 --> 03:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's very difficult to get
the Syrian regime to behave in
accordance with any external

03:16.900 --> 03:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
powers, understand and
come to an agreement over.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was clearly a case of the
regime behaving in a manner that
probably upset the Russians,

03:24.100 --> 03:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
may or may not have
upset the Iranians.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not sure.

03:27.133 --> 03:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And certainly the United
States didn't like it.

03:29.033 --> 03:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the regime will continue
to behave in that manner
and I think we're going to

03:32.266 --> 03:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to have to either
react or back down or ignore it.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will talk
about that in just a moment.

03:37.633 --> 03:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Exum, in your view, was
this inevitable, it was going
to happen just because of the

03:43.633 --> 03:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of war that is
being fought there?

03:45.666 --> 03:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense:
Well, I think what Faysal

03:47.800 --> 03:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said is very wise, and that
often we have seen the tail
wag the dog with respect to

03:52.700 --> 03:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Syrian regime and
its external sponsors.

03:54.700 --> 03:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, they have not carried
out what Russia or Iran
would like them to do.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think that's very wise.

04:01.133 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would also say, however, that
where we are in the military
campaign against the Islamic

04:05.433 --> 04:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State means that U.S. and
other coalition forces are
going to be in closer proximity

04:11.266 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Syrian regime forces.

04:13.833 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you know, the legal
and policy assumptions
that underpin the U.S.
and coalition war against

04:20.666 --> 04:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic State was that the
Syrian regime couldn't exert
any type of sovereignty east,

04:25.900 --> 04:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the Islamic
State has been.

04:27.866 --> 04:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's beginning to change,
and the coalition is starting
to spread out as well.

04:30.766 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, unfortunately, you're
seeing those forces in greater
proximity, and I expect you are

04:34.666 --> 04:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to see more of these
incidents in the future.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that your
expectation, that this is just
getting more complicated by the

04:40.500 --> 04:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
day, practically?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think we're
getting closer to our primary
objectives towards ISIS, which

04:45.866 --> 04:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to take a certain amount
of core territory in Eastern
Syria and especially around the

04:50.533 --> 04:52.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Raqqa province.

04:52.633 --> 04:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, physically, it brings
us in greater proximity, but
it also poses a threat to the

04:55.800 --> 05:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime that we may end up
actually handing over very
important strategic territory to

05:00.366 --> 05:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our own allies, whether
it's Arabs or most likely
the Kurdish-dominated SDF.

05:04.866 --> 05:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that includes
water resources.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It includes oil resources.

05:08.266 --> 05:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now that the regime
has stabilized the west enough
to be able to throw forces

05:12.966 --> 05:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elsewhere, and Iran has as
well, then they're coming in
our direction, and I don't think

05:17.633 --> 05:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have a long-term
plan for that.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I do want
to ask you both about that.

05:21.733 --> 05:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, Andrew Exum,
I was struck today.

05:24.100 --> 05:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians came -- right out
of the box, they were saying
they're now going to target

05:28.400 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any U.S. plane -- I'm sorry --
any plane by the U.S. coalition
that goes into a certain

05:35.000 --> 05:36.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

05:36.666 --> 05:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is this just ripe for
either another strike
or miscalculation?

05:42.133 --> 05:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes and no.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, of course,
this is worrying.

05:46.533 --> 05:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's going to
be a real concern to
our coalition partners.

05:49.966 --> 05:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a pretty robust
integrated air defense
system over most of Syria.

05:53.933 --> 05:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is not a fun thing
to fly around and through.

05:57.166 --> 06:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their air defenses are actually
not as strong in the east.

06:03.366 --> 06:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia also cut off the
deconfliction hot line.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't read
too much into that.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have done it before.

06:08.966 --> 06:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It in Russia's interests
to be able to deconflict
our air operations,
just as much as it is

06:13.100 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the interests of
the United States and
the coalition partners.

06:16.133 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I suspect that, once the
temperatures cool a little
bit, that those deconfliction

06:20.833 --> 06:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
channels will be up
and running again.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, obviously, it's worrying.

06:24.566 --> 06:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Russians, of course,
will use this as an opportunity
to convince the Americans

06:28.066 --> 06:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we need to be working
closer together in Syria,
which is something that we have

06:32.533 --> 06:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been, for obvious reasons,
quite resistant to do.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Faysal Itani, this does pull
the U.S. closer in, doesn't it?

06:38.833 --> 06:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think what
we have tried to do so far in
the war is, we have tried to

06:42.866 --> 06:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of tiptoe around the
western part of the country,
the war in the west, what we

06:46.933 --> 06:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call the civil war usually in
our discourse, and focus on
the war that we wish to fight,

06:51.600 --> 06:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is the war against ISIS.

06:53.733 --> 06:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is a sign that,
actually, as far as the
players with the most at stake

06:57.566 --> 07:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, Iran and the Syrian
regime, are concerned,
these are not separate wars.

07:01.666 --> 07:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is all war over
territory and over resources
and over influence.

07:06.633 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we are having to
come to a conclusion, that we're
stumbling into it somewhat, but

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we will get there.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it
possible, Andrew Exum,
to separate the two?

07:16.633 --> 07:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I
think Faysal is right.

07:19.400 --> 07:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, I think the
regime still has quite a lot
of consolidation to do in

07:26.400 --> 07:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Western Syria, but I think
Faysal is correct in that the
regime still yearns after the

07:31.700 --> 07:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil and gas resources that
are in the east of Syria.

07:33.900 --> 07:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, quite frankly, the
regime's Iranian backers want
some sort of land bridge into

07:40.800 --> 07:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq, which is why the Euphrates
River Valley is so important
to perhaps not as much as

07:46.166 --> 07:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime, but certainly
to its Iranian supporters
and to Hezbollah as well.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, yes, to Faysal is right.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The strategic geography does
not end in Western Syria.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It extends to the east as well.

07:56.766 --> 08:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
both of you if it's clear to
you -- Faysal Itani, to you

08:00.766 --> 08:02.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
first.

08:02.733 --> 08:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it clear to you what the
goal of the U.S. mission
right now is in Syria?

08:09.700 --> 08:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Well, the official
goal is clear enough, which
is, we're there to defeat ISIS,

08:14.666 --> 08:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to displace it from Raqqa
and other territories.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What exactly the territorial
scope of that is, is not clear.

08:20.166 --> 08:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we're actually doing
as this conflict evolves and
unfolds and more dimensions are

08:26.533 --> 08:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
added to it, no, I don't
think -- it's not clear to me.

08:28.733 --> 08:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't even know if it's
clear to us, to be honest with
you, because I don't know how

08:32.133 --> 08:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important we think it
is to compete with the
Iranians and the Syrian
regime over this territory

08:38.300 --> 08:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and over influence
in post-ISIS Syria.

08:39.566 --> 08:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems like we
haven't made a decision.

08:41.066 --> 08:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
that question, Andrew Exum?

08:43.466 --> 08:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I
think largely the same.

08:46.033 --> 08:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that the
United States has first
off had a legal basis and
has had policy agreement

08:51.600 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on defeating the Islamic State.

08:53.633 --> 08:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's been where the U.S.
military and its coalition
partners have been focused.

08:57.766 --> 09:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has not been consensus
or even a legal basis to carry
that fight over to the Assad

09:04.533 --> 09:06.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think the United States
and its coalition partners have
some real hard choices going

09:11.000 --> 09:12.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I say coalition
partners, I don't just mean the
international community, but

09:14.533 --> 09:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean the partners
on the ground as well.

09:16.766 --> 09:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, when they defeat
the Islamic State -- and the
Islamic State is going to

09:20.600 --> 09:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be defeated -- or is the United
States fine with the territory
that's been won back from

09:27.066 --> 09:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Islamic State falling into
the hands of the Assad regime?

09:28.933 --> 09:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that an appropriate or
acceptable policy outcome?

09:32.066 --> 09:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's not, then I think
some decisions are going to
have to be made quite quickly.

09:36.666 --> 09:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Otherwise, we're going
to end up stumbling
into a broader conflict
without a clear strategy

09:42.666 --> 09:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to win that conflict.

09:44.733 --> 09:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And wrapping
up, Faysal Itani, how urgent
is it that the U.S. make these

09:49.266 --> 09:51.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions?

09:51.766 --> 09:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Very
urgent, because these
things that you saw today
and have been happening

09:53.800 --> 09:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the -- actually over the
past few weeks, and they haven't
been happening only as sort

09:56.566 --> 09:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of airstrike incidents.

09:58.433 --> 10:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was actually a
ground attack on our
partners in Northern Syria.

10:02.466 --> 10:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a bit scared that it hasn't
-- it doesn't appear to have
actually been wrapped up yet

10:06.700 --> 10:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a strategic discussion.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean
by the administration.

10:09.633 --> 10:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: By the United
States government, yes.

10:11.666 --> 10:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Andrew Exum, how do you see the
pressure on the administration

10:17.200 --> 10:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make this decision?

10:19.333 --> 10:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I think
there are competing voices
within the administration.

10:22.266 --> 10:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the military has
been almost myopically
focused on defeating the
Islamic State, because

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's the mission
they have been given.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are also some
strong voices within the
administration that would like

10:33.700 --> 10:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to broaden this conflict in
order to focus on Iran and
Iran's proxies in Syria.

10:39.766 --> 10:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's quite
dangerous, obviously.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could be especially
dangerous to get in that type
of escalation without having

10:46.333 --> 10:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the forces on the ground.

10:48.900 --> 10:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is also no
consensus with the United
States' international
partners regarding that

10:53.866 --> 10:55.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goal.

10:55.866 --> 10:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, unfortunately,
the administration has
yet to make up its mind.

10:58.966 --> 11:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nothing
simple about this one.

11:01.666 --> 11:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Andrew Exum, Faysal
Itani, thank you both.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FAYSAL ITANI: Thank you.
