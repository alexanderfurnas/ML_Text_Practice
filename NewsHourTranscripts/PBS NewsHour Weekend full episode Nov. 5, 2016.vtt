SO WE HAVE WATCHED AS THE NUMBER

04:36.109 --> 04:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF HISPANICS GROW AND THE UNIQUE

04:38.912 --> 04:40.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING IS, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT

04:40.514 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:43.216 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:44.951 --> 04:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HISPANICS COULD DO FOR

04:46.586 --> 04:47.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON IN FLORIDA WHAT

04:47.988 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:50.090 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA, AND THAT IS HAND HER THE

04:51.858 --> 04:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT

04:54.361 --> 04:56.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGED AND CONTINUES TO GROW

04:56.997 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE RETIREES.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TEND TO BE WHITE, AND THEY

05:01.067 --> 05:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:02.202 --> 05:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE IN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT I

05:06.406 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:14.881 --> 05:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ONE DEALING WITH SOLAR

05:15.916 --> 05:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER, A COUPLE OF TAX

05:17.083 --> 05:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:21.421 --> 05:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF SO, WHO WOULD THEY DRIVE

05:22.589 --> 05:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE POLLS?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I DO THINK THE MEDICAL

05:27.160 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIJUANA INITIATIVE IS ONE THAT

05:29.362 --> 05:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS DRIVING PEOPLE.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT,

05:33.967 --> 05:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC OPINION

05:36.203 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:37.237 --> 05:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER AMENDMENT IS BEING

05:39.105 --> 05:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PURSUED BY THE UTILITY

05:40.440 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES, AND IT'S REALLY

05:41.708 --> 05:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGNED-- IT WAS KIND OF

05:43.643 --> 05:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGNED AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM

05:45.845 --> 05:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT

05:47.647 --> 05:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER MADE IT TO THE BALLOT.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THAT IT'S ON THE BALLOT AND

05:50.784 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DID USE IT TO PUT LANGUAGE

05:52.118 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT WILL LIMIT ROOFTOP

05:54.588 --> 05:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLAR EXPANSION-- OR COULD

05:56.423 --> 05:58.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIALLY LIMIT IT-- THERE ARE

05:58.158 --> 05:59.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF SOLAR ADVOCATES THAT

05:59.793 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE MOTIVATED TO VOTE BECAUSE

06:01.795 --> 06:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO VOTE AGAINST THAT

AMENDMENT.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHO THAT WILL

06:05.532 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVANTAGE, THOUGH.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

MARIJUANA-- MEDICAL MARIJUANA,

06:10.170 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:17.377 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK IT'S-- WHEN IT COMES

06:18.912 --> 06:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE SOLAR AMENDMENT, THAT

06:21.081 --> 06:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS TO BE A DEMOCRAT ISSUE

06:23.450 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MANY DEMOCRATS HAVE ALIGNED
