JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.906 --> 00:06.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
"NewsHour"e tonight:
Donald Trump doubles down on his
claim President

00:12.079 --> 00:17.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama and Hillary Clinton
founded ISIS, as
Clinton lays out her vision for
America's

00:17.751 --> 00:19.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

00:19.653 --> 00:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Thursday: The
Afghan army loses ground to
Taliban insurgents,

00:24.625 --> 00:27.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tightening their grip on
Afghanistan's key
Helmand Province.

00:27.461 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how New York
City turned
an abandoned railroad track into
a beautiful

00:33.000 --> 00:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
park, drawing millions of
visitors.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES CORNER, Landscape
Architect: They see
this.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have discovered a found
object.

00:40.073 --> 00:43.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a sense of surprise, a
sense of delight.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's real and authentic.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not Disney.

00:46.280 --> 00:53.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.820 --> 00:56.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.590 --> 01:07.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From terrorism to
taxes, the candidates
duel today over their visions of
each other.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton talked economic
policy.

01:10.003 --> 01:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump repeatedly
claimed that her
failures in the Obama
administration allowed

01:14.875 --> 01:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a deadly new enemy to emerge.

01:16.944 --> 01:20.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Oh, boy, is ISIS hoping for her.

01:20.113 --> 01:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump is stepping up
his effort
to tie Hillary Clinton time as
secretary of

01:25.252 --> 01:28.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state to the rise of the Islamic
State.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This morning, in Miami:

01:30.057 --> 01:33.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know, if
you're a sports
team, most valuable player, MVP.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You get the MVP award.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS will hand her the most
valuable player
award.

01:39.766 --> 01:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And last night in
Fort Lauderdale,
with this about President Obama:

01:44.104 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: ISIS is honoring
President Obama.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is the founder of ISIS.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's the founder.

01:53.347 --> 01:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say the co-founder
would be crooked
Hillary Clinton.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:01.221 --> 02:05.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Republican
nominee defended
the line of attack in a call-in
today to CNBC.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There is something
wrong with
saying that?

02:06.393 --> 02:07.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

02:07.761 --> 02:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are people complaining that I
said he was
the founder of ISIS?

02:10.530 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: I am wondering how you
think that's
going to play in some
battleground states.

02:15.869 --> 02:16.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't know.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Whatever it is, it is.

02:18.638 --> 02:22.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Clinton campaign
dismissed
it all as trash-talking, and
said: "It goes

02:22.075 --> 02:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without saying that this is a
false claim.

02:25.012 --> 02:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's echoing the talking points
of Vladimir
Putin and our adversaries to
attack American

02:30.317 --> 02:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leaders and American interests."

02:32.819 --> 02:38.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the campaign trail, Clinton
ripped into
Trump's economic policies in a
speech outside

02:38.892 --> 02:40.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Detroit.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She charged he's outright scared
of free trade,
and likened it to the Olympics.

02:44.765 --> 02:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
If Team USA was as fearful as
Trump, Michael

02:49.603 --> 02:56.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Phelps and Simone Biles would be
cowering
in the locker room afraid to
come out to compete.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:57.411 --> 03:01.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Instead,
they are
winning gold medals.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America isn't afraid to compete.

03:03.650 --> 03:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton went on to
cite a litany
of issues that she said Trump
remains silent

03:08.755 --> 03:10.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He has
offered no
credible plans to address what
working families

03:13.360 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up against today, nothing on
student loans
or the cost of prescription
drugs, nothing

03:18.598 --> 03:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for communities of color in our
cities to
overcome the barriers of
systemic racism,

03:24.704 --> 03:27.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nothing to create new
opportunities for young
people.

03:27.774 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But even as Clinton
surges in
the polls, there's new worry for
Democrats

03:32.179 --> 03:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about a cyber-attack blamed on
Russian hackers.

03:35.882 --> 03:40.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports they
breached e-mail
accounts of more than 100 party
officials

03:40.954 --> 03:42.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and groups.

03:42.823 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's on top of hacking of the
Democratic
National Committee and the
party's House campaign

03:47.127 --> 03:48.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman
Schultz was forced
to step down when that news came
to light

03:52.766 --> 03:55.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the eve of the party
convention.

03:55.368 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi addressed
the issue in Washington today:

03:58.872 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
Russians broke in.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who did they give the
information to?

04:02.509 --> 04:03.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who dumped it?

04:04.511 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do know that this is a
Watergate-like
electronic break-in.

04:09.015 --> 04:13.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Pelosi said she
doesn't know whether
her own e-mails were targeted.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's equally unclear what
revelations
may yet be coming from the
hackers.

04:19.025 --> 04:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will turn to the candidates'
competing
proposals on the economy after
the news summary.

04:24.064 --> 04:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: American-backed
militias claimed new progress in
capturing

04:29.336 --> 04:32.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Islamic State's last
stronghold in Libya.

04:32.906 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The militia forces say they have
now liberated
70 percent of the city of Sirte.

04:38.111 --> 04:43.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just a day earlier, they took
control of several
key sites there, including a
sprawling convention

04:43.750 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
center that ISIS fighters had
used as a headquarters.

04:46.953 --> 04:52.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Australia is
accusing asylum-seekers
of lying about sexual abuse in
offshore detention

04:53.026 --> 04:54.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camps.

04:54.594 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 2,000 incidents
allegedly happened
on the island nation of Nauru.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Australia's immigration
minister rejected
the accounts today.

05:01.701 --> 05:05.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER DUTTON, Australian
Immigration Minister:
I would just add a word of
caution to some

05:05.172 --> 05:07.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the hype that's out there at
the moment.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If people have done the wrong
thing, whether
it's security guards, whether
it's people

05:10.277 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our employ directly or
elsewhere, then
there's a price to pay for that.

05:14.214 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But bear in mind that some
people do have
a motivation to make a false
complaint, and

05:19.452 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have had instances where
people have self-harmed
in an effort to get to
Australia, and I'm

05:23.423 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to tolerate that
behavior either.

05:25.625 --> 05:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Australia refuses to
accept asylum-seekers
trying to reach its shores by
boat.

05:31.298 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It pays Nauru and Papua New
Guinea to hold
them instead.

05:35.001 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the
Philippines, startling
numbers today from a crackdown
on drugs.

05:40.574 --> 05:45.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It began under new President
Rodrigo Duterte
as of July 1.

05:45.178 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, police report
killing 525 suspected
dealers who they say put up a
fight.

05:52.152 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, they have arrested
more than
7,600 suspects on charges of
drug dealing.

05:58.491 --> 06:03.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And another half-a-million
people have turned
themselves in to authorities.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human rights advocates are
protesting the
killings.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration
balked at

06:09.836 --> 06:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reclassifying marijuana as a
lesser drug.

06:12.973 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, it stays on the list of
the most
dangerous alongside heroin and
ecstasy.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a growing push to
legalize pot.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the DEA said it still has a
high potential
for abuse.

06:24.451 --> 06:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The scientists
who found lead
contamination in Flint,
Michigan's water now

06:29.522 --> 06:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say the problem has greatly
improved.

06:32.158 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A team from Virginia Tech
University tested
162 homes in July and reported
that 45 percent

06:40.066 --> 06:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had no detectable levels of
lead.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is up from just 9 percent
with no lead
a year ago.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC EDWARDS, Virginia Tech
University: This
really shows that the corrosion
control and

06:49.442 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the things that are being
implemented
by the feds and state and city
are really

06:54.447 --> 06:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working, and Flint's system is
on its way
to recover.

06:58.385 --> 07:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that doesn't mean the
current situation
is acceptable.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this process of healing is
going to continue.

07:06.126 --> 07:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For now, however,
the researchers
say all Flint residents should
continue to

07:10.864 --> 07:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
drink bottled or filtered water.

07:13.066 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On Wall Street,
stocks followed
oil prices higher after an
international report

07:18.405 --> 07:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forecast greater stability in
the oil market.

07:21.474 --> 07:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
118 points to close at 18613.

07:28.281 --> 07:33.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose close to 24
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 10.

07:33.553 --> 07:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And at the Summer
Olympic Games,
Americans finished one-two in
the women's

07:38.191 --> 07:40.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gymnastics individual
all-around.

07:40.894 --> 07:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Biles cemented her place
as the best
in the world, taking gold, and
Aly Raisman

07:46.933 --> 07:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was right behind her to grab
silver.

07:49.602 --> 07:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, American Kayla
Harrison successfully

GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
how the presidential candidates'
tax plans

08:00.447 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could affect your budget; a
major setback
for Afghan security forces in
Helmand Province;

08:06.653 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new normal of slow economic
growth; and
much more.

08:13.660 --> 08:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Few things are
certain in life,
and this year's presidential
campaign has

08:27.440 --> 08:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certainly defied tradition.

08:29.676 --> 08:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it comes to taxes, it's
become clear
there are pretty big differences
between the

08:34.180 --> 08:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two major party candidates.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our ongoing look at
issues shaping
this election.

08:41.554 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Taxes, among
the most powerful
of government policies,
affecting how we live

08:46.926 --> 08:48.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and work every day.

08:48.828 --> 08:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week starts the first
head-to-head policy
speeches between Hillary Clinton
and Donald

08:53.900 --> 08:55.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump, starting with Trump
Monday.

08:55.635 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I am proposing an
across-the-board income

08:58.505 --> 09:02.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax reduction, especially for
middle-income
Americans.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump's plan?

09:03.977 --> 09:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would simplify the tax system
to just three
smaller rates and fewer
deductions.

09:08.681 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His top rate would be 33 percent
vs. the current
39.6 percent.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't yet know who would see
which rates.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's more specific on the estate
tax.

09:19.526 --> 09:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the tax on inheritances
over $5.4 million.

09:23.763 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump would eliminate that tax
altogether,
a big benefit for farmers and
wealthy families.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans say it is fair and
positive.

09:31.237 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, in her economic
speech in
Michigan today, could not have
disagreed more.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Multimillionaires shouldn't be
able to pay

09:40.346 --> 09:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lower tax rate than their
secretaries.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:44.984 --> 09:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton would
charge a minimum
30 percent tax on incomes over a
million dollars,

09:50.190 --> 09:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she'd raise the total tax
rate to 43.6
percent for those making over $5
million.

09:56.729 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton wouldn't change rates
for the lower
or middle classes.

10:00.567 --> 10:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton charges that Trump's tax
plan is a
giveaway to the wealthy,
especially one big

10:05.138 --> 10:06.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: In his
speech on Monday,
he called for a new tax loophole
-- let's

10:10.376 --> 10:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call it the Trump loophole --
because it would
allow him to pay less than half
the current

10:18.284 --> 10:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax rate on income from many of
his companies.

10:22.388 --> 10:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton is
talking about
something complicated, but
important, called

10:26.226 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pass-through income.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's how it works.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Classically, a business pays a
35 percent
rate on taxable incomes.

10:33.800 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some businesses, where the
owner or family
is the business -- think about
attorneys with

10:38.438 --> 10:42.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their own firms, for example --
can pay using
what's called a pass-through.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that case, the business
doesn't pay a corporate
tax.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the company pays the
owner and the
owner pays an individual income
tax of up

10:51.584 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 39.6 percent.

10:54.621 --> 10:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This exists so the owner isn't
taxed twice,
as a business and individual.

10:59.692 --> 11:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump's plan would cut
all corporate
taxes to 15 percent.

11:04.230 --> 11:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would set a new 15
percent rate for
these pass-through incomes, a
huge cut that

11:10.470 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could apply to his own
businesses.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He responds that Clinton and
Democrats overtax
companies.

11:16.809 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: All Hillary
Clinton has to offer
is more of the same, more taxes,
more regulations,

11:23.216 --> 11:28.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more bureaucrats, more
restrictions on American
energy and on American
production.

11:29.022 --> 11:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Different
visions, Trump
offering tax cuts to all,
especially the wealthy,

11:34.594 --> 11:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton pledging to tax the
wealthy more and
to use that money for programs
for the middle

11:39.098 --> 11:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and lower classes, including
targeted tax
credits.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

11:45.338 --> 11:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clearly, there
are still many
other details to both of their
plans, but

11:51.110 --> 11:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's focus in on some of the
bigger differences
of their approaches to taxes
with Neil Irwin.

11:56.616 --> 12:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He reports on business and
economic issues
for The New York Times.

12:00.887 --> 12:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Wessel, director of
the Hutchins
Center on Fiscal and Monetary
Policy at the

12:05.992 --> 12:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brookings Institution, and a
contributing
correspondent for The Wall
Street Journal.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think both of you agree
with what we
have just been hearing.

12:16.636 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest differences between
Clinton and
Trump are over how their tax
plans treat the

12:21.608 --> 12:22.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wealthy.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, spell that out a little
more for us.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the difference?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
Hillary Clinton has a very clear
strategy

12:28.081 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of increasing taxes on the
wealthy.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She would increase the estate
tax.

12:33.052 --> 12:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She would increase, as Lisa's
piece said,
the marginal income tax rate on
the highest

12:37.390 --> 12:39.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
income earners.

12:39.459 --> 12:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, on the other hand, would
lower taxes
for pretty much everybody, but
he would disproportionately

12:44.330 --> 12:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lower them for people at the
top.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he would do away with the
estate tax.

12:48.601 --> 12:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a sense, she wants to use
the tax code
to narrow the gap between
winners and losers

12:54.440 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our economy, and he doesn't
make that a
priority.

12:58.011 --> 13:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants to lower taxes and says
that that
will somehow unleash a burst of
economy growth.

13:03.182 --> 13:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Neil, remind
us, how do
we define wealthy here?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What income levels are we
talking about?

13:09.756 --> 13:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN, The New York Times:
Well, with
Hillary Clinton, the biggest
surcharge is

13:12.325 --> 13:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for people making over $5
million a year.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the very, very wealthy.

13:16.663 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But she has some other
provisions that affect
people a little further down the
income scale,

13:20.833 --> 13:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some provisions that make sure
people making
over $1 million pay at least 30
percent.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes -- so that deals
with the issue
that Warren Buffett has talked
about where

13:28.741 --> 13:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some secretaries, middle-class
people can
end up with effectively a higher
rate than

13:32.445 --> 13:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who make their income
through capital
gains.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's kind of a multitiered
effort she's
doing to use some different
dials within the

13:38.818 --> 13:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax code to try and shift
overall the burden
a little heavier toward the
affluent.

13:42.655 --> 13:47.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, in
connection with that,
David, let's talk about what the
two of them

13:47.894 --> 13:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would do when it comes to
corporations and
businesses.

13:50.630 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know there's a lot here,
you know, we
could focus on.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, mainly, what are the
differences between
the two?

13:57.203 --> 14:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, the main
difference is
that Donald Trump wants to cut
the tax on

14:02.241 --> 14:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
businesses, and she doesn't.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's pretty simple like that.

14:06.679 --> 14:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a number of targeted tax
breaks for
businesses to encourage them to
do things

14:11.517 --> 14:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she and her advisers think
would be good
for the economy, more
apprenticeships, more

14:15.855 --> 14:17.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profit-sharing.

14:17.790 --> 14:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is willing to cut the
rate, allow them
to write off a lot more stuff
more quickly.

14:22.995 --> 14:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, one advantage he has, he
doesn't pay
for any of this stuff.

14:27.066 --> 14:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So she's very carefully, you
increase this,
you cut that.

14:30.603 --> 14:34.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's not making the long-term
deficit better,
but she's not making it worse.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He seems unconcerned with that,
so he can
give a lot more tax breaks.

14:37.276 --> 14:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, revenue
overall to the
Treasury, to the government
would go down

14:40.646 --> 14:41.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under his proposal?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: A lot, yes,
trillions of dollars.

14:43.449 --> 14:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Neil, be a little
bit more
specific on that, Neil, because
we have talked

14:48.221 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about -- Lisa referred to
something called
the pass-through, where if
somebody owns a

14:52.658 --> 14:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business, they -- again, without
confusing
everybody, what does that
really, effectively

14:58.097 --> 14:59.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

14:59.065 --> 15:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: It's kind of a big
deal.

15:01.634 --> 15:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump talks about doing a
15 percent
rate on business income, not
just corporations

15:05.571 --> 15:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Apple or GE, but also on
small businesses,
including partnerships,
including if I have

15:12.478 --> 15:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sole proprietorship, if I have
a small partnership,
he wants a 15 percent rate on
that income

15:17.450 --> 15:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, which means it creates
great incentive
-- if you're a wealthy person
looking at a

15:22.488 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 percent rate in the current
tax code, 33
percent under Trump's plan, you
can actually

15:27.160 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get that down to 15 percent if
you can somehow
route that income through a
business, through

15:31.430 --> 15:32.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a partnership.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we will see if that
happens is a
lot of people trying to do that.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what's interesting is if
you're a wage-earner,
if you get a paycheck from your
boss, there's

15:39.939 --> 15:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no way you're going to be able
to take advantage
of this.

15:42.975 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you can somehow turn
yourself into
a little company, a lawyer who
is a partner,

15:47.980 --> 15:54.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or you're some kind of a
baseball player who
says, I'm now I'm -- I'm David
Wessel, Incorporated,

15:54.320 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then I can take advantage of
this.

15:57.023 --> 16:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So a whole set of people, if
they can organize
themselves as businesses, can
take advantage

16:02.028 --> 16:02.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ordinary wage-earners can't.

16:04.363 --> 16:05.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is it
expected that that
would happen, Neil?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL IRWIN: It is.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government -- the law can
try and do things
to try and fight it.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we already see some of this
that happens
to avoid payroll taxes.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is clearly one of the issues
that will
have to be resolved.

16:14.841 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In connection
with this, we
often hear Donald Trump talk
about corporate

16:18.477 --> 16:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax rates are way too high in
this country.

16:20.580 --> 16:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The effective rate, though,
David, as I understand
it, is lower than what the
number is.

16:26.452 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People end up paying less, or
companies end
up paying less than what they
are charged

16:30.990 --> 16:31.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on paper.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the statutory rate, the rate
in the law
is 35 percent, but when you look
at all the

16:36.562 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deductions and credits and
exclusions that
we give businesses, the
effective rate, on

16:41.200 --> 16:43.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
average, is much lower than
that, in the 20s.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For some companies, it's higher.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some companies, it is lower.

16:47.139 --> 16:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a lot of momentum
in Washington
to redo the corporate tax code,
take away

16:51.811 --> 16:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of these deductions and
credits, and
lower the rates.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been very politically
difficult because
there are winners and losers.

16:58.084 --> 17:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And actually neither candidate
has gotten
very specific about how they do
that.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
ask you both
about the middle class, people
earning less

17:04.457 --> 17:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than what the wealthy do.

17:05.791 --> 17:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But before we do, Neil, what
about changes
in the estate tax?

17:09.128 --> 17:12.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the tax people are
charged when they
die.

17:12.298 --> 17:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pass on everything they
have to their
children and there's a tax
associated with

17:16.035 --> 17:17.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do Clinton and Trump deal
with that?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: Well, with Trump,
it's simple.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to get rid of it
entirely.

17:20.806 --> 17:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing to remember, right
now, the
cutoff there for a married
couple, it's $10.9

17:24.911 --> 17:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million, meaning you have to be
a multimillionaire
when a person dies to face that
tax at all.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He still wants to get rid of it.

17:32.251 --> 17:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton wants to go the
other direction,
reduce those exemptions down to
$7 million

17:36.856 --> 17:38.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for a married couple.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it would affect more people
than it does
now if Hillary Clinton got her
way.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, what
would the
effect be on revenue, David?

17:43.496 --> 17:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, we don't get
a lot of
revenue from the estate tax.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know the direction.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think what Neil says is
really important.

17:49.835 --> 17:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, of every 1,000 people who
die in a given
year, only two of them face the
estate tax.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it affects only the very
rich.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost more of a talking
point than it
is a real tax policy.

18:02.448 --> 18:05.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We often hear
Republicans refer
to it as the death tax.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't why they do that.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:09.855 --> 18:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about,
Neil, the
middle class, and let's be clear
about what

18:14.393 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bracket, what income bracket
we're talking
about, because, again, we see
differences

18:18.664 --> 18:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the two of them and what
they would
do with the tax rates.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NEIL IRWIN: Yes.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump does have a
middle-class
tax cut.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's fairly small.

18:25.571 --> 18:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's moving one of the key
brackets from 15
percent to 12 percent.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One estimate, the proposal his
is based on
would cut after tax income for
middle-class

18:34.013 --> 18:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families by something like 0.2
percent, something
like 5 percent for the richest 1
percent.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he does have that tax cut in
there.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary doesn't.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question, though, is, is the
scale that
they're talking about something
that is going

18:45.157 --> 18:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to really move the dial and
change living
standards for middle-class
Americans?

18:48.427 --> 18:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the numbers just aren't that
big.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
say, David, that
Trump has been saying the last
several days

18:52.865 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Clinton favors raising
taxes on the middle
class.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says absolutely she does
not.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her -- in the proposals she
has laid out,
she doesn't raise taxes on the
middle class.

19:01.974 --> 19:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do you
single out the
differences there on what
happens to the middle

19:07.013 --> 19:08.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class?

19:08.881 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, as I said,
because Trump
is cutting taxes for a lot of
people and not

19:11.117 --> 19:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paying for it, he's able to
offer some tax
cuts, like the one Neil
described.

19:16.255 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton has some
targeted tax cuts,
like increasing the tax break
for child care,

19:23.329 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which she has now responded to
in a vague
and evolving way.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when you step back,
what Hillary
Clinton is really saying is,
look, some people

19:31.070 --> 19:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to have to pay more
taxes.

19:33.839 --> 19:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to come up with a plan
that puts
all those tax increases on
people who make

19:38.477 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than $250,000 a year.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to be able to do
very much for
people who make less than that.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not going to cut their taxes
much, but
I'm also not going to raise
them.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you to
do that,
Neil?

19:49.522 --> 19:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should say that whatever
candidates
say during a campaign is not
always necessarily

19:53.125 --> 19:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they can get passed once
they're elected.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: That's always true.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is also some stuff on
child tax credits.

19:59.331 --> 20:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton talks about it
as a credit
that would help a lot of
middle-class, lower-income

20:03.102 --> 20:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
families afford child care.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump wants to do it as a
deduction.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would mainly apply to the
wealthiest
Americans, upper-middle-class
families.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's another key
distinction in this.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: We should mention
that they
both talk about college and
student loans

20:16.816 --> 20:18.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in different forms.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary is talking about making
college debt-free.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that would obviously be
things that
are targeted to the middle
class.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Hillary Clinton is
also saying,
look, I want to spend a lot of
money on pre-K

20:27.960 --> 20:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and infrastructure, and that
will help people
get jobs and higher wages.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there is a
whole lot
to look at with their economic
plans.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has taken a big bite out of
it.

20:35.935 --> 20:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we thank you both, Neil
Irwin, David Wessel.

20:42.074 --> 20:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

20:48.747 --> 20:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the summer's
political and
foreign policy debate has
focused overwhelmingly

20:55.721 --> 21:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the rise of ISIS, an old foe
continues
to threaten lives and security
in Afghanistan.

21:01.727 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban have been closing in
on Lashkar
Gah, the capital of Helmand
Province, forcing

21:06.832 --> 21:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
residents to flee as the Afghan
army struggles
to contain them.

21:11.003 --> 21:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined now
from Kabul
by special correspondent
Jennifer Glasse.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jennifer, welcome.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been to Lashkar Gah, to
the provincial
capital.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us, what is important about
that and
what is happening there?

21:21.847 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, the
people down there
are very concerned.

21:24.283 --> 21:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban in the last week or
so have basically
encircled the city, taken many
of the road

21:29.789 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leading into and out of the
town.

21:31.590 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they feel besieged;
30,000 people
have been displaced just in the
last couple

21:36.095 --> 21:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of weeks alone, and the Afghan
army is struggling
to contain the Taliban and to
keep them out

21:41.167 --> 21:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the provincial capital.

21:43.068 --> 21:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if the Taliban were to
assault provincial
capital, it would be the first
time they have

21:46.272 --> 21:48.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tried it since 2008.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That assault was beaten back.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, it's been a
difficult time
for them.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have some help down there.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghan forces have sent down
reinforcements.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have help in the form of
American airstrikes.

21:58.751 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. officials say there have
been at least
25 U.S. airstrikes in the past
two weeks alone

22:04.123 --> 22:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the Taliban have mounted that
offensive.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Probably the biggest problem is
that they
are controlling many of the
routes in and

22:10.429 --> 22:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the city, including the
main road between
Lashkar Gah and Kandahar, the
two big cities

22:16.869 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Southern Afghanistan.

22:18.904 --> 22:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This -- of course, Helmand has
always been
a contested province.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighting down there has been
particularly
fierce.

22:25.377 --> 22:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 125 U.S. soldiers have
lost their
lives there, including one
soldier who died

22:29.915 --> 22:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in January in fighting in
Helmand Province.

22:32.785 --> 22:38.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 400 British soldiers, as
well as another
100 or so coalition forces have
died during

22:38.357 --> 22:40.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the conflict in Helmand
Province.

22:40.125 --> 22:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it has always been a heavily
contested
province, but the fact that the
Taliban are

22:43.128 --> 22:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making an offensive, making
advances on the
provincial capital, I think,
shows that they

22:48.200 --> 22:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are resurgent here, Gwen.

22:50.002 --> 22:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What effect have
those -- you
talked about the U.S.
airstrikes, the 25 U.S.

22:53.939 --> 22:54.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airstrikes.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What visible effect have they
had?

22:56.775 --> 23:01.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well,
certainly, they have
helped move the Taliban back or
keep the Taliban

23:01.313 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from forming in big groups,
because that's
what we have seen since the
drawdown of U.S.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces, since the withdrawal of
NATO forces,
the end of 2014.

23:10.589 --> 23:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Without that airpower, the
Taliban were able
to group in large numbers.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what the airstrikes
are helping.

23:16.161 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, U.S. officials also say
there are combat
enablers on the ground in
Lashkar Gah, in

23:22.735 --> 23:24.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Helmand Province.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that could mean forces on
the ground,
fighting forces on the ground.

23:27.206 --> 23:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could also mean spotters
who help target
those airstrikes more
effectively.

23:31.977 --> 23:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also several hundred
American advisers
that went down there last year
to help reform

23:37.449 --> 23:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 215 Army Corps that is in
Lashkar Gah,
that is in Helmand Province,
trying to hold

23:42.421 --> 23:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that province together, helping
with, main
role, training, advising and
assisting the

23:46.358 --> 23:47.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Afghan forces.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Afghan force is clearly
struggling.

23:49.295 --> 23:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why are the Afghan
forces, why
do they appear to be so weak,
after all of

23:54.433 --> 23:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the support they have gotten,
not only from
the U.S., but also in training
and advising?

24:00.005 --> 24:01.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What has gone wrong, if
anything?

24:01.473 --> 24:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, there are
a number
of problems.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of it is inexperience.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is still a relatively new
force.

24:08.180 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. officials say they are
better this year
than they were last year because
they have

24:12.084 --> 24:13.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some combat experience.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a little bit of better
strategic
experience.

24:16.188 --> 24:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there have been American
advisers down
there helping with the force.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Problems with leadership.

24:21.894 --> 24:27.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Many of the generals and
officials down there
have been changed or moved out.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Problems with strategy.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things that the
Afghans used
to do was go and set up
checkpoints on roads.

24:32.571 --> 24:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They, of course, were easy
targets for the
Taliban.

24:35.507 --> 24:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the U.S. forces and other
NATO advisers
are trying to help them with is
to actually

24:41.113 --> 24:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go and take land that they need
to take, hold
land that they need to hold.

24:45.451 --> 24:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's definitely been a
struggle in the
last week or so around Lashkar
Gah, as the

24:49.855 --> 24:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Taliban have made a concerted
offensive there,
in some cases even blowing up
bridges.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Afghan security forces
-- also with
a fledgling air force.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they don't have their own
airpower.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why the U.S. has
introduced its
airpower.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the Taliban, how
strong is
it?

25:04.002 --> 25:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We went through this back and
forth in Kunduz
not long ago.

25:07.773 --> 25:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, it's not
really whether
at this point Lashkar Gah falls
or not.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It really is the psychological
battle.

25:15.447 --> 25:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, last week, the Taliban went
into a district
south of Lashkar Gah, in the
Helmand River,

25:21.353 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went into the district center
for a brief
point of time.

25:23.922 --> 25:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the enemy army pushed
them back.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really not whether they can
hold the
area, because in Kunduz in the
north, they

25:29.795 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only held the city center for
about three
days.

25:32.631 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the knock-on effect of that
was really
very dramatic, because it
instilled fear in

25:37.536 --> 25:38.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They did go around.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They gathered a lot of
intelligence.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They gathered people's names in
Kunduz.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the concern, of course, of
the people
in Lashkar Gah, if they are able
to get into

25:45.978 --> 25:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city, are able to get close
as they have
gotten, it just shows that they
still are

25:50.015 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a resurgent Taliban.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are very concerned,
not just in
Helmand Province, but around the
country,

25:54.953 --> 25:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Taliban have been able
to make such
gains.

25:57.489 --> 26:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jennifer Glasse
reporting for
us tonight from Kabul, thank you
so much.

26:02.294 --> 26:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Good to talk to
you, Gwen.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:15.441 --> 26:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
New York
City's High Line changed the way
we think

26:19.711 --> 26:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about parks; virus hunters
tasked with tracking
down the next outbreak before it
happens;

26:26.885 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a filmmaker and poet making
her Olympic
debut.

26:30.422 --> 26:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: One question looming
over this
election is, what is the best
way to boost

26:35.727 --> 26:37.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the economy?

26:37.596 --> 26:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, the government
reported worker
productivity, which can affect
wages and growth,

26:42.534 --> 26:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
declined for the third straight
quarter, the
longest slide since the late
'70s.

26:47.372 --> 26:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some economists are asking if
slower growth
is the new normal.

26:51.577 --> 26:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has been
exploring that question.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a second look.

26:56.415 --> 27:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our series on
Making Sense of
financial news, which airs
Thursday.

27:00.486 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: President Obama's
last of State
of the Union featured this proud
proclamation:

27:05.157 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Anyone claiming that America's
economy is

27:09.394 --> 27:11.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in decline is peddling fiction.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But really?

27:13.699 --> 27:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell that to eminent economist
Robert Gordon,
a Democrat, who's peddling a
distinctly nonfictional

27:19.838 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new book, "The Rise and Fall of
American Growth."

27:23.475 --> 27:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON, Author, "The Rise
and Fall
of American Growth": Did you
know that the

27:25.677 --> 27:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cable car dates back to 1870,
the beginning
of what I call the special
century, when life

27:31.183 --> 27:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was revolutionized in the United
States?

27:34.219 --> 27:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A century that
ended in 1970,
46 years ago.

27:40.726 --> 27:45.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gordon's thesis that slower
growth is the
new normal in the U.S. has
sparked a major

27:45.097 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate in economics the past few
years.

27:48.267 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His book was a hot topic at this
year's meeting
of the American Economic
Association in San

27:53.705 --> 27:55.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Francisco.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB SHILLER, Nobel Laureate:
It's what you
call a magnum opus.

27:57.075 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's Nobel
laureate Bob Shiller,
this year's president of the
group, who organized

28:01.547 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a session on the new book and
chaired it himself
to spotlight Gordon and his
special century

28:08.820 --> 28:10.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thesis.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: A century that
freed households
from an unremitting daily grind
of gainful

28:14.560 --> 28:19.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
manual labor, household
drudgery, darkness,
isolation and early death.

28:19.831 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There seems little
dispute in
economics these days that 1870
to 1970 was

28:25.437 --> 28:27.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
technologically special.

28:27.139 --> 28:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: No one who hasn't cooked
over a wood
stove by the light of a kerosene
lamp can

28:31.577 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really appreciate what it all
means.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So it was an
amazing century,
right?

28:35.213 --> 28:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON, Massachusetts
Institute
of Technology: It was an amazing
century.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We took so much muscle power,
things that
used to be done by horses or by
humans, and

28:41.587 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replaced it with machines.

28:43.522 --> 28:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But MIT's Erik
Brynjolfsson doesn't
buy the argument that the U.S.
economy's best

28:47.793 --> 28:49.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
days are over.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: We're now
just in the early
stages of what we sometimes call
a second

28:51.530 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
machine age, where we're
beginning to do the
same things for brainpower,
things like artificial

28:57.002 --> 28:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence, computers and big
data.

28:59.638 --> 29:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we're going to see a
productivity
wave the likes of which we have
never seen

29:03.008 --> 29:04.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: It's just a hope
that Erik
has that these new inventions of
robots and

29:08.780 --> 29:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artificial intelligence are
going to change
the world on a par with
electricity and the

29:13.952 --> 29:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
internal combustion engine.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just think of the benefits of
getting rid
of the urban horse.

29:18.790 --> 29:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think of all the horse droppings
all over
the street that we no longer
have to think

29:22.327 --> 29:24.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about and clean up.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To counter those
who consider
his cavalier dismissal of high
technology

29:27.432 --> 29:32.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much, well, horse manure,
Gordon took us
on an intimate show-and-tell.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Look at a few of
the things
that were invented in the
special century

29:35.841 --> 29:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after 1870, starting with the
electric light,
the greatest invention of all.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now let's look at two of the
great inventions
of all time.

29:44.316 --> 29:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, we have running water,
which eliminated
the need to carry water into the
house in

29:49.154 --> 29:51.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pails.

29:51.056 --> 29:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have the flush
toilet, which eliminated
the need to go outside into the
bitter cold

29:55.827 --> 29:57.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to an outhouse.

29:57.396 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here we have a double
invention, central
heating and air conditioning.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have the telephone invented
in 1876.

30:05.370 --> 30:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the television set,
partly invented
here in San Francisco by
Philosophy Farnsworth,

30:10.342 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then look what we have
hidden down here,
a refrigerator, which eliminated
the contamination

30:15.847 --> 30:17.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of food.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here we have the Golden Gate
Bridge, an
example of the tremendous
investment in infrastructure

30:21.720 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that made our economy grow so
fast in the
middle of the 20th century.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This bridge was finished in
1937.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: The Golden Gate is
bridged.

30:30.295 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Put them all
together, says Gordon,
and there's been no comparable
stretch of

30:36.101 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economic growth before or since.

30:39.771 --> 30:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Here is the basic
point of
my book.

30:44.009 --> 30:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The early 20th century, the
middle of the
20th century between 1920 and
1970, and all

30:49.347 --> 30:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the years since then, and the
role of innovation
and technology is that black
area at the bottom.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we highlight it we see
that in the
middle of the 20th century, we
were growing

30:59.357 --> 31:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three times faster than we have
been in the
last 40 years.

31:02.961 --> 31:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And not only were
the really
big inventions already on the
market by 1970.

31:09.301 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This footage of the 1962 Seattle
World's Fair
suggests the ones we consider
big today were

31:15.941 --> 31:17.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already in the works.

31:17.743 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: One day, you may be
able to call
home and automatically turn off
the oven or,

31:22.247 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a public telephone, water
the lawn during
that dry spell when you are many
miles away

31:27.619 --> 31:28.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on vacation.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sounds fantastic, doesn't it?

31:30.188 --> 31:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Critics like
Brynjolfsson don't
dispute the wonders of the past.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They just think we haven't seen
anything yet.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: It's been
said that the
greatest failing of the human
mind is the

31:39.464 --> 31:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inability to understand the
exponential function.

31:41.533 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's especially true in
the computer
era, where computer power
doubles about every

31:46.204 --> 31:47.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
24 months or so.

31:47.839 --> 31:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Exponential growth
like 2-4-8-16
and so on.

31:51.476 --> 31:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: What that
does is, it leads
us to overestimate what's going
to happen

31:55.480 --> 31:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the short run, because at
first it's happening
fairly slowly, but then we
underestimate what

31:59.050 --> 32:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens in the long run, when
things really
take off.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bob Gordon scoffs.

32:02.821 --> 32:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: But computers
have been riding
this exponential wave for the
last 50 years,

32:06.758 --> 32:08.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's not shown up in
productivity.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In measured GDP
output per unit
of labor, that is.

32:12.164 --> 32:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: We have gone from
the mainframe
to the personal computer to the
smartphone,

32:16.468 --> 32:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and only in the late 1990s did
we see a revival
of productivity growth of the
kind of magnitude

32:23.175 --> 32:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to match the great old days of
electricity
and the invention of the
motorcar and the

32:27.779 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airplane.

32:29.614 --> 32:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Productivity, says
Gordon, has
slowed to a crawl for years now,
what's called

32:33.952 --> 32:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long-term or secular stagnation.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: The last time
people were
talking a lot about stagnation
was in the

32:39.991 --> 32:41.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1930s.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And guess what?

32:42.661 --> 32:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next couple of decades were
the best decades
ever for economic growth.

32:46.431 --> 32:51.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Admittedly,
Americans have been
techno-overoptimists before.

32:51.269 --> 32:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: The 9000 series is the
most reliable
computer ever made.

32:56.408 --> 32:59.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are all foolproof and
incapable of error.

32:59.744 --> 33:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The year 2001 came
and went without
any manned space odysseys of
note.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Open the pod bay doors,
Hal.

33:08.386 --> 33:12.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Much less ones with
the likes
of artificially intelligent Hal.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: I'm sorry, Dave.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm afraid I can't do that.

33:16.328 --> 33:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But most striking
to us is the
near-universal agreement about
the headwinds

33:22.701 --> 33:29.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now facing U.S. economic growth:
problems
in education, an aging
population, a huge

33:29.341 --> 33:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national debt, and, most of all,
growing inequality.

33:34.779 --> 33:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economic historian Greg Clark
said he's long
been a techno-optimist.

33:39.484 --> 33:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But after reading Gordon's book:

33:41.353 --> 33:42.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREGORY CLARK, Economic
Historian, University
of California, Davis: I am
actually convinced

33:42.821 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now that the best of America is
behind us
in terms of economic growth.

33:46.558 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Clark titled his
talk "Winter
Is Coming," a nod to the grim TV
series about

33:52.831 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a more primitive time, HBO's
"Game of Thrones."

33:56.334 --> 34:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CLARK: I titled it that
way because
I was struck, when I looked at
the future

34:01.840 --> 34:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the U.S. economy, how much it
was going
to resemble the medieval
economy.

34:07.412 --> 34:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The medieval
economy?

34:09.314 --> 34:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CLARK: The medieval
economy, in terms
of the types of jobs that people
now are doing,

34:13.518 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gardening, food preparing,
serving, cleaning,
bricklaying, carpentry.

34:20.292 --> 34:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could get someone from 1400,
put them
on the job and in two hours,
they'd be perfectly

34:25.664 --> 34:26.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
functional.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Working, that is,
but hardly
getting by.

34:29.067 --> 34:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to Robert Gordon, the
connection between
stagnant wages and today's
political unease

34:35.540 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is obvious.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Because the heart
of slow wage
growth is slow productivity
growth.

34:40.879 --> 34:44.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And added to that is the
inequality that is
siphoning off the little
productivity that

34:44.449 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have got into the top 1
percent.

34:46.785 --> 34:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the bottom 99 percent
have good reason
to be resentful and anxious.

34:50.722 --> 34:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman, reporting

34:56.261 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from San Francisco.

34:59.631 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next: As we have
seen with recent
pandemics, emerging diseases
like Zika and

35:13.345 --> 35:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ebola can cross continents and
oceans with
uncontrolled speed.

35:18.216 --> 35:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists are identifying areas
where new
infectious diseases are most
likely to emerge,

35:22.887 --> 35:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there are high risks of
animal viruses
passing to humans.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of those areas is Southern
China.

35:29.928 --> 35:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan brings us this
report, which
was produced in collaboration
with Global

35:34.232 --> 35:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Health Frontiers.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:37.035 --> 35:41.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER DASZAK, President,
EcoHealth Alliance:
We're in Guilin in Southern
China, in one

35:41.873 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the most beautiful parts of
China with
these amazing limestone hills
and valleys

35:46.711 --> 35:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and very scenic and picturesque.

35:49.447 --> 35:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Peter Daszak
is the president
of EcoHealth Alliance, a
nonprofit organization

35:54.886 --> 35:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based in New York dedicated to
protecting
wildlife and public health from
the emergence

35:59.758 --> 36:00.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of disease.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:02.694 --> 36:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: The reason we're
here is, we're
interested in the risk of new
diseases emerging

36:06.765 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the wildlife trade in
China, just like
SARS did a few years ago and
just like ultimately

36:12.737 --> 36:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIV did in Africa 40-odd years
ago.

36:16.708 --> 36:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can get to the source of
where they
come from and reduce the risk,
we could solve

36:22.947 --> 36:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge problem and save millions
of lives,
rather than waiting for them to
emerge and

36:28.119 --> 36:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
try to mop it up afterwards.

36:31.122 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At markets
across China,
like this one, people come in
daily to buy

36:37.262 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chickens and ducks.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: It increases the
risk of a pathogen
like avian flu from spreading,
because you

36:43.601 --> 36:45.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have got live chickens.

36:45.336 --> 36:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If one of them is infected, it
brings the
virus in, and it spreads to this
flock over

36:50.475 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few hours, and then those
animals are taken
to all distant parts of the
region.

36:56.514 --> 37:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you could see this activity
anywhere
in the world.

37:00.985 --> 37:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is just like what happens
in rural America
and rural parts of Europe.

37:06.257 --> 37:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the difference is, here,
we're in a hot
zone for emerging diseases.

37:10.195 --> 37:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a place where we have
repeatedly seen
outbreaks from poultry moving
into people

37:15.533 --> 37:17.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and spreading globally.

37:17.402 --> 37:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Natural
habitats can also
contribute to the spread of
viruses.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:23.274 --> 37:25.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: We have got people
fishing in
the river.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got people washing in
the river.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know there is sewage coming
directly from
the houses into the river.

37:30.748 --> 37:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not much wildlife here,
but wild
ducks will come down to this
river as well

37:35.787 --> 37:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mix in and migrate with the
viruses and
spread them backwards and
forwards into this

37:40.925 --> 37:44.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mix.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a big mixing vessel for
pathogens.

37:48.032 --> 37:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At a goose
farm, Daszak
and his team are looking for
signs of avian

37:57.242 --> 37:58.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flu.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.944 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: The idea is that,
if we can
catch the viruses they carry
here, we can

38:02.547 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prevent them going to market and
potentially
spreading

38:13.057 --> 38:14.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the disease.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OK, ready.

38:16.394 --> 38:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take swabs from the mouth,
and we take
cloacal swabs.

38:20.064 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We put them in viral transport
medium and
then ship them in liquid
nitrogen to the lab

38:25.136 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for testing.

38:26.404 --> 38:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Avian flu is a virus that's
common in many
types of birds.

38:31.109 --> 38:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But especially in poultry and
waterfowl, it's
a real killer.

38:36.047 --> 38:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some of these strains can
also jump directly
into people.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's the problem.

38:42.654 --> 38:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Viruses that
can cross over
and infect humans have led to
previous pandemics,

38:47.158 --> 38:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including the most devastating
in recorded
world history, the 1918 flu,
which killed

38:52.630 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more people than the First World
War, more
than 500 million infected
worldwide, and as

38:57.936 --> 39:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many as 100 million deaths over
a two-year
period.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:02.507 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: We're trying to
say, where is
the next avian flu going to come
from?

39:08.112 --> 39:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can we see it before it becomes
a pandemic
problem and stop it?

39:13.117 --> 39:14.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There you go.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I look at this a little bit like
earthquakes.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know earthquakes can be
devastating.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know they're pretty rare, and
we know where
they happen.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is the same for
pandemics.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that this is a hot spot
for pandemics.

39:26.431 --> 39:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know why it happens, but what
we're not
doing with pandemics that we are
doing with

39:31.569 --> 39:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earthquakes is reducing the
damage initially.

39:34.939 --> 39:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been going on for 5,000
years.

39:38.042 --> 39:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Working with
EcoHealth Alliance
in this part of China is field
operations

39:43.348 --> 39:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manager Dr. Guangjian Zhu, a
biologist trained
in the ecology of bats, which
are known to

39:49.153 --> 39:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the source of the SARS virus.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:52.824 --> 39:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUANGJIAN ZHU, Field Operations
Manager: It's
really urgent to teach people
how to deal

39:56.828 --> 40:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the virus and just change
our normal
behavior to decrease the risk of
virus transfer.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: This is a big
tourist cave.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Shall we go?

40:11.876 --> 40:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Daszak is
concerned about
a bat cave that is a popular
tourist destination.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:17.715 --> 40:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: You have got the
Rhinolophus
horseshoe bats right here in
this cave with

40:22.654 --> 40:23.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all these tourists going
through.

40:23.955 --> 40:24.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:24.956 --> 40:25.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GUANGJIAN ZHU: Yes.

40:25.957 --> 40:26.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETER DASZAK: Yes.

40:28.393 --> 40:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bats here in this cave are
the same bats
that carry SARS virus.

40:33.031 --> 40:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bats live in the cave all day
long, because
they're nocturnal.

40:37.035 --> 40:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they're up there, they
urinate and
defecate, right on top of the
tourists that

40:41.639 --> 40:43.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are walking through.

40:43.341 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all you have got to do is be
that one
person to breathe in at the
wrong time, and

40:47.245 --> 40:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suddenly you have been infected
with a virus
that is not only potentially
lethal to people.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could cause a future
pandemic.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sent you the samples from
these bats.

40:57.889 --> 41:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Daszak and his
team have
used mathematical models to try
to understand

41:01.492 --> 41:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what is driving these diseases.

41:03.361 --> 41:05.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER DASZAK: We went back to
every known
example of emerging disease,
HIV, Ebola, West

41:09.000 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nile virus, SARS, plotted where
it originated.

41:12.737 --> 41:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we said, what are the things
that are
going on in those places?

41:17.642 --> 41:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two big drivers are growing
human populations,
land use change, and high
wildlife diversity.

41:26.751 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rapid global
response to
disease outbreaks is essential
to stopping

41:31.889 --> 41:34.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
transmission and saving lives.

41:34.225 --> 41:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Daszak and his team of virus
hunters believe
that forecasting where outbreaks
are most

41:40.998 --> 41:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely to occur is a critical
part of a defensive
strategy needed to prevent
outbreaks before

41:47.004 --> 41:48.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they emerge.

41:48.039 --> 41:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

41:52.410 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's now a must for
visitors to
New York City, taking a walk
above far above

42:05.456 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the madding crowd in a new kind
of urban park.

42:09.327 --> 42:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown took that walk
with the man
who helped create it.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES CORNER, Landscape
Architect: This is
one of my favorite moments.

42:14.665 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is where these tracks
crisscross.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's called a frog.

42:18.503 --> 42:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Railroad tracks
of old in a
park that has helped changed
contemporary

42:22.440 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking about cities and public
spaces.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: We amplify found
conditions.

42:27.378 --> 42:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Recently, I
visited New York's
phenomenally successful High
Line Park with

42:32.216 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its designer, landscape
architect James Corner.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: I think this is
what a lot of
people like.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They see this.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have discovered a found
object.

42:40.925 --> 42:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a sense of surprise, a
sense of delight.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's real and authentic.

42:45.930 --> 42:46.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not Disney.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And it really is
real.

42:48.699 --> 42:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: And people get a
kick out of
it, especially in the context of
modern-day

42:52.503 --> 42:54.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Manhattan.

42:54.205 --> 42:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The original
railway tracks,
30 feet above street level, were
built in

42:58.109 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 1930s.

43:00.144 --> 43:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trains carried meat, milk and
other cargo,
sometimes making deliveries
direct to Manhattan

43:05.950 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
companies.

43:07.785 --> 43:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After trains stopped running
here -- the last
was in 1980 -- the site wasted
away, an eyesore

43:13.124 --> 43:18.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that no one could figure out
what to do with,
until they did: Create a new
kind of public

43:18.763 --> 43:20.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
park.

43:20.565 --> 43:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since its opening in 2009, the
High Line has
attracted millions of visitors
and plenty

43:26.070 --> 43:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of attention from other cities
eager to recreate
its magic.

43:30.708 --> 43:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Corner's firm, James
Corner Field Operations,
worked on the High Line with
architects Diller

43:37.248 --> 43:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scofidio and Renfro and famed
Dutch garden
designer Piet Oudolf.

43:41.219 --> 43:49.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: It was a huge
effort and a big
leap of faith, because the High
Line was really

43:49.227 --> 43:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perceived by a lot of people to
be a liability,
derelict, abandoned, dangerous,
dark, drugs,

43:56.834 --> 43:57.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crime.

43:57.835 --> 44:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So inviting.

44:00.505 --> 44:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: Nothing good,
nothing good.

44:02.273 --> 44:03.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

44:03.341 --> 44:04.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:04.442 --> 44:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think has been the
key to its
success?

44:06.143 --> 44:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: When you came onto
the High
Line, because the trains had
stopped running

44:09.380 --> 44:16.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and natural seeds had taken
root, it was a
beautifully surprising and
delightful one-and-a-half-mile

44:16.821 --> 44:18.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ribbon of green.

44:18.856 --> 44:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you had this green carpet in
silence, a
sort of strange, haunting
quality to it.

44:26.664 --> 44:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believed that if we were to
simply leverage
that, make it more of a garden
than it was

44:33.070 --> 44:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, allow for the kind of
voyeurism and
the exhibitionism that occurs on
an elevated

44:38.976 --> 44:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
structure when you can peek into
openings
and streets and buildings, that
there would

44:45.283 --> 44:47.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be something very charming about
that.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: More of a garden.

44:49.120 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the High Line features an
astonishing
assortment of plantings that
give a sense

44:53.858 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nature thriving, even taking
over in the
midst of the city, and the
voyeurism or exhibitionism

45:01.299 --> 45:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of walking on a raised platform.

45:03.935 --> 45:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's all about the views across
the city,
and into buildings, and about
watching and

45:09.006 --> 45:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing your fellow human beings
up close.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES CORNER: It affects
people's psyche.

45:13.611 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It affects their imagination.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It affects how they relate to
other people.

45:18.649 --> 45:23.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just charges up the
positive energy
about what it means to live in a
city.

45:23.321 --> 45:27.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In a sense, they're
theatricalizing everyday
life.

45:27.391 --> 45:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can promote a new kind of
civic, public
value that I think is very
important.

45:32.196 --> 45:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Theatricalizing?

45:33.197 --> 45:34.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dramatizing?

45:34.198 --> 45:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: Dramatizing?

45:35.866 --> 45:39.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean it's not
just a beautiful
space; it's almost like a
theater?

45:39.070 --> 45:40.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CORNER: Exactly.

45:40.805 --> 45:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a bit of a balcony
or a catwalk,
if you will, where they can show
off too.

45:45.476 --> 45:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the interaction of people
who want to
be quiet and recessive and look
from a hidden

45:51.015 --> 45:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spot, vs. people who want to be
sitting out
front and center and be part of
the show,

45:56.854 --> 45:59.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a theatricality to that.

45:59.557 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's kind of cool.

46:01.359 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Part of the
theater on this
day included a sculpture called
The Sleepwalker

46:05.529 --> 46:06.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Tony Matelli.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: This is public
art, and...

46:08.466 --> 46:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
irresistible.

46:09.467 --> 46:10.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: Irresistible.

46:10.468 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's kind of -- he's
sleepwalking.

46:11.535 --> 46:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But is he going
to wink at
us?

46:13.437 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: He might do, if
you stare at
him long enough.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Corner grew up in
Manchester,
England.

46:19.610 --> 46:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's lived and worked in the
U.S. since the
1980s.

46:23.180 --> 46:29.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and his firm are now in great
demand, designing
public spaces for cities around
the country,

46:29.453 --> 46:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seattle's Waterfront, San
Francisco's Presidio,
a huge park in Memphis, and much
more, including

46:36.894 --> 46:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cleveland's brand-new Public
Square, which
served as a protest site during
the recent

46:41.699 --> 46:43.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican Convention.

46:43.267 --> 46:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: In the '70s and
'80s, we spoke
about a flight to the suburbs.

46:47.004 --> 46:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People were leaving the city to
live in more
or less detached homes with
gardens and greenery.

46:54.378 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those same people are now coming
back to the
city, and there's now, in a
sense, a flight

46:58.649 --> 47:00.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the city.

47:00.518 --> 47:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People want the cosmopolitanism,
the diversity,
the exposure, the amenities that
a city provides.

47:09.060 --> 47:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want restaurants and cafes
and theaters
and museums, and parks and
public spaces.

47:15.800 --> 47:20.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: If anything, the
High Line
may be a victim of its own
success.

47:20.438 --> 47:25.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can be clogged with people,
and property
values around it have
skyrocketed, pushing

47:25.643 --> 47:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all but the rich, individuals
and companies,
further away.

47:30.114 --> 47:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, James Corner sees a huge
benefit in
creating spaces for people of
all walks of

47:35.119 --> 47:36.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
life to gather.

47:36.887 --> 47:40.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: We're social
animals, and we
want to have a place to live,
and we want

47:40.191 --> 47:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a place to work, but we
also want
to have a place to participate
with other

47:45.229 --> 47:46.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

47:46.997 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe it is now, perhaps
more than
ever, more fundamental to what
it means to

47:52.169 --> 48:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a democracy to be able to
foster greater
understanding, greater
tolerance, understand

48:00.411 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it means to live in diverse
communities,
and to embrace that as something
enriching

48:07.284 --> 48:09.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and positive.

48:09.086 --> 48:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The High Line
itself continues
to expand, with construction of
a so-called

48:12.757 --> 48:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spur, a block-long offshoot,
starting in 2017.

48:17.828 --> 48:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirty feet above the streets of
Manhattan,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

48:22.099 --> 48:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: a poet and a
filmmaker who
also happens to be an Olympic
runner in Rio.

48:32.143 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: a poet and a
filmmaker who
also happens to be an Olympic
runner in Rio.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She will be competing tomorrow.

48:42.920 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you will see, there are
a number of
connections for her between the
way she writes

48:47.057 --> 48:48.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the way she runs.

48:48.292 --> 48:51.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXI PAPPAS, Olympic Athlete:
My name is
Alexi Pappas.

48:51.262 --> 48:54.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm a professional
long-distance runner
with Nike.

48:54.398 --> 48:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm also a filmmaker,
actress and poet.

48:58.803 --> 49:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summer, I will race in my
first Olympic
Games in the 10,000 meters on
the track.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will be running for Team
Greece.

49:06.410 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a duel citizen and decided
to compete
for Team Greece because I can
compete at the

49:13.651 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highest level, but I can also
reach a young
generation of girls who don't
necessarily

49:18.889 --> 49:24.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the long-distance role
models that we
are lucky enough to have in the
United States.

49:24.094 --> 49:27.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I'm very excited.

49:27.131 --> 49:32.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think I was a more serious
poet before I
was a serious runner.

49:32.469 --> 49:37.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I find with writing that is
so special,
and in poetry in particular, is,
there's such

49:37.308 --> 49:38.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an economy of words.

49:38.843 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like having absolute
freedom within
boundaries.

49:45.115 --> 49:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in running, similarly, there
are these
limitations.

49:47.885 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a race, you might have a
certain lane
that you have to stay in or a
certain number

49:51.956 --> 49:53.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of laps or a course.

49:53.791 --> 49:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But within those boundaries,
there's so much
room for freedom and creativity
and personality.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"Breaking Tape."

50:02.800 --> 50:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It happened like I imagine it
would feel
to throw open big double doors,
the kind from

50:11.275 --> 50:15.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a mansion or dollhouse.

50:15.312 --> 50:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I looked maybe like a very
strong princess
charging through the gate
towards the castle

50:23.487 --> 50:25.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I built myself."

50:25.356 --> 50:34.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Tracktown" is a film that we
have just made
and premiered and is inspired by
my observations

50:34.198 --> 50:38.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and experiences as an elite
runner in Eugene,
Oregon.

50:38.736 --> 50:44.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I moved to Eugene to
run a fifth
year with the Oregon Ducks after
I graduated

50:44.041 --> 50:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dartmouth, I found that the town
and the community
embraced running in a way that I
had never

50:49.246 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seen before.

50:50.547 --> 50:55.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: "A goal is a dream with a
deadline"
-- Napoleon Hill.

50:55.119 --> 51:00.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXI PAPPAS: As a storyteller,
I want to
tell stories that I uniquely can
tell and

51:00.658 --> 51:05.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stories in highly specific
worlds that most
people don't get the chance to
see.

51:05.396 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so "Tracktown" is set in the
running world,
but is really about this girl,
and what is

51:11.101 --> 51:15.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her life like on the track, but
especially
off the track.

51:15.039 --> 51:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Olympics have been on my
mind since my
dad brought my brother and me to
the 1996

51:22.112 --> 51:23.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Olympics in Atlanta.

51:23.781 --> 51:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to experience something
at the highest
level.

51:26.951 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And being there, you're among,
like, greatness,
like great minds and great
bodies.

51:32.256 --> 51:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of being nervous about
what people
are concerned about in Rio, it's
not the first

51:37.828 --> 51:39.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing on my mind.

51:39.663 --> 51:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of athletes
will agree that
we have worked for more than
four years for

51:44.034 --> 51:46.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this dream, for our whole lives.

51:46.837 --> 51:52.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And nothing can stop most of us
from going
and realizing that dream.

51:52.242 --> 51:54.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"Scary Things."

51:54.511 --> 52:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The thing about scary things,
like spiders,
is that they do not scare me
nearly as much

52:02.019 --> 52:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the things I want the most
things."

52:05.589 --> 52:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The things you're scared of, I
think, is a
reflection of how I feel every
day.

52:10.995 --> 52:16.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Like, as a runner and a
filmmaker, I wake
up every single day a little bit
nervous,

52:16.967 --> 52:19.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but in a good way.

52:19.136 --> 52:24.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's always a goal that I
always have,
maybe a goal for that day or a
goal for longer-term,

52:24.675 --> 52:26.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an Olympic dream.

52:26.443 --> 52:31.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's admitting that these
pursuits are really
hard, but they're really
beautiful.

52:31.949 --> 52:37.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I hope I always have
something that I
wake up being like a little bit
scared and

52:37.488 --> 52:39.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very excited for.

52:39.256 --> 52:44.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

evening with David Brooks and
