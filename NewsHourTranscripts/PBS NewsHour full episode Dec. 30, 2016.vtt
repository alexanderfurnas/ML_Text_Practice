HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.442 --> 00:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour":
Russian President
Vladimir Putin will not expel
American diplomats

00:12.779 --> 00:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in response to sanctions imposed
by the Obama
administration.

00:16.316 --> 00:21.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at what lies ahead for
U.S.-Russian
relations in a Trump presidency.

00:21.221 --> 00:26.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: the best of 2016 in
music, a year
of innovation and stunning
comebacks, but

00:26.760 --> 00:28.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also great loss.

00:28.562 --> 00:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS, NPR: One great thing
about when
we mourn these singers is that
we also always

00:34.368 --> 00:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebrate and archive their
work, and we're
seeing that.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday.

00:39.306 --> 00:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks and David Corn are
here to analyze
the week's news.

00:42.542 --> 00:49.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.316 --> 00:52.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.119 --> 01:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Russian
President Vladimir
Putin today slammed U.S.
sanctions and the

01:00.827 --> 01:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expulsion of Russian diplomats
over election
hacking attacks.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said Moscow will not toss
out U.S.
diplomats.

01:08.268 --> 01:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he invited the children
of American
diplomats to holiday parties at
the Kremlin.

01:13.273 --> 01:17.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a statement, he said
Russia will plan
further steps to restore
relations, based

01:17.744 --> 01:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the policies of the Trump
administration.

01:20.047 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the president-elect
tweeted to say:
"Great move on delay by Vladimir
Putin.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I always knew he was very
smart."

01:27.354 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to the Putin
response after
the news summary.

01:31.525 --> 01:36.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news: A
fragile cease-fire
appeared to hold across Syria,
despite sporadic

01:36.964 --> 01:38.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shooting.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diana Magnay of Independent
Television News
reports.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: It's not as though
there's no
fighting today.

01:44.104 --> 01:49.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a regime airstrike
earlier on near
the city of Hama, but nothing so
severe that

01:49.209 --> 01:51.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the deal's off yet.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID MOALLEM, Syrian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): There is a real
opportunity to

01:54.848 --> 01:59.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach a political solution for
the crisis
in Syria that ends the bloodshed
and establishes

01:59.853 --> 02:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the roots for the future of the
country.

02:02.356 --> 02:07.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: With the front
lines quiet,
people in opposition areas went
back onto

02:07.594 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the streets, just as they had
done in the
early days of the revolution,
not that everyone

02:12.566 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here remembers those days, but
the refrain's
familiar: a Syria without Assad,
even if the

02:17.771 --> 02:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outcome's as unclear as ever.

02:20.207 --> 02:26.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If you say that if we are
happy with
being Assad in power, of course
we will not

02:26.780 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be happy.

02:28.548 --> 02:33.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can make sure for you that
all those
people who are refugees now
either inside

02:33.253 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria or outside Syria will not
be back to
Syria unless Assad goes away
from his position

02:40.761 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as president of Syria.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: That will be up to
the Russians.

02:44.965 --> 02:50.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aleppo was part of this deal,
struck between
Turkey and Russia in two months
of back-and-forth

02:50.137 --> 02:51.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
talks.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Aleppo now chalked up for
the regime,
it's now up to Putin to see what
pressure

02:54.941 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he can bring to bear on Syria's
president
before talks next month in
Kazakstan, if this

03:00.881 --> 03:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cease-fire holds, and that's a
big if.

03:04.885 --> 03:09.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along its border, Turkey is
expanding its
facilities for refugees, to
house the tens

03:09.923 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands freshly displaced
from Aleppo
through this bitter winter and
beyond.

03:15.429 --> 03:21.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia and Turkey pitching
themselves as regional
power-brokers, guardians against
terror, bringers

03:21.034 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of peace, high stakes if they
fail, but the
initiative now is with them.

03:26.173 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, a
North Carolina judge blocked a
Republican

03:29.609 --> 03:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bid to strip the incoming
Democratic governor
of some of his powers.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans passed the statute
after Roy Cooper
was elected.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It takes away his control of
election boards.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cooper sued today, saying the
law is unconstitutional.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The judge stopped it from taking
effect on
Sunday, pending a review.

03:46.293 --> 03:51.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New numbers confirm that fatal
shootings of
police rose sharply in 2016.

03:51.531 --> 03:56.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Law Enforcement
Officers Memorial
fund reports 64 were shot and
killed in the

03:56.970 --> 04:00.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line of duty, up 56 percent from
last year.

04:00.140 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The total includes 21 officers
killed in ambush-style
attacks in Dallas, Baton Rouge
and elsewhere.

04:07.314 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A winter storm socked New
England overnight
and, today, the region's first
strong nor'easter

04:11.451 --> 04:12.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the season.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some areas got as much as two
feet of snow.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Near-white-out conditions hit
Maine, where
snow fell at the rate of three
inches an hour

04:19.292 --> 04:20.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in some places.

04:20.794 --> 04:24.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm knocked out power to
more than 100,000
homes and businesses.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street closed out a
winning year
on a losing note.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gave up 57
points to finish at 19762.

04:31.705 --> 04:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 49
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped 10.

04:36.143 --> 04:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for the year, the Dow gained
more than
13 percent; the Nasdaq rose 7.5
percent; and

04:42.149 --> 04:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the S&amp;P was up 9.5 percent.

04:45.685 --> 04:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
U.S.-Russia
relations after President Obama
imposes sanctions;

04:50.891 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks and David Corn take
on the week's
news; a year of triumph and
heartbreak for

04:56.429 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
music fans; and much more.

05:02.736 --> 05:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We now turn back to the latest
in U.S.-Russia
relations.

05:14.814 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For insight into Putin's
reaction to the Obama
administration's leveling of
sanctions against

05:19.119 --> 05:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia yesterday, we turn to
Andrew Weiss.

05:21.421 --> 05:25.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was director of Russian,
Ukrainian and
Eurasian affairs at the White
House National

05:25.592 --> 05:26.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Security Council staff.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now with the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what do you make of Putin's
reactions?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS, Carnegie Endowment
for International
Peace: Vladimir Putin is an
opportunist, and

05:33.300 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he loves being the center of
attention.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So here he has got the entire
world talking
about his incredible magnanimity
in not returning

05:39.973 --> 05:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the favor by expelling U.S.
diplomats or responding
to these sanctions.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple of months ago, when
Putin was talking
about the hacking scandal, he
basically said,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a few years ago, no one talked
about Russia.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now that's all people want to
talk about.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say bad things, but it's
good for us.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all very pleasant.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And do any of
the sanctions
create deterrents enough for
Russia to stop

05:59.059 --> 06:00.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing what they have been doing?

06:00.927 --> 06:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Establishing
deterrents for
a country like Russia to deter
it from conducting

06:04.931 --> 06:09.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offensive cyber-operations
against the United
States is practically an
impossible task.

06:09.302 --> 06:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you can do is, you can
expose, you can
name and shame, you can hit a
few key individuals

06:14.074 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or key institutions, like the
Obama administration
did yesterday, that might sort
of expose what

06:19.412 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia is doing, provide public
education,
especially on the eve of
important European

06:23.450 --> 06:25.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elections.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what governments are
doing around the
world, is they're trying to say,
we know what

06:27.654 --> 06:28.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Russians are up to.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can explain it to our
publics.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And hopefully it will not have
the effect
it had in the United States.

06:32.425 --> 06:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is the
invitations
of the diplomats' children to
the Kremlin

06:36.263 --> 06:37.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holiday party?

06:37.697 --> 06:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is that trying to fix?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: I think it's cheap
theatrics
at this point.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's basically a stunt.

06:43.503 --> 06:47.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had a pattern of
harassment of U.S.
personnel in Moscow that goes
back several

06:47.641 --> 06:48.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People's apartments are broken
into.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Diplomats are followed.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Children are bothered.

06:53.146 --> 06:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been I think an extreme
period, a
very unusual period of Cold
War-style pressure

06:57.350 --> 06:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against our people stationed in
Moscow.

06:59.486 --> 07:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, really,
even in this
moment, he sees the long game.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Putin looks ahead
and I think
sees continued opportunities.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a new U.S. administration
taking office
obviously on January 20.

07:11.331 --> 07:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump has been
saying all
sorts of flattering things,
including as recent

07:16.002 --> 07:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as this afternoon, about how
brilliant Putin
is, what an effective leader he
is.

07:20.974 --> 07:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has seen all sorts of Western
leaders basically
disappear from the scene, most
obviously Barack

07:26.479 --> 07:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama, who has been a nemesis
for him.

07:28.548 --> 07:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if he looks ahead, he sees
Russia's got
the upper hand in Syria, he's
transformed

07:32.519 --> 07:35.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the battle on the ground inside
Syria.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He sees a weak Ukraine.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sees Western Europe divided,
a weakening
E.U.

07:39.959 --> 07:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got, I think, a sense of
wind at his
back and more confidence that
the more audacity,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the more surprise, the more the
West is going
to back off.

07:48.134 --> 07:52.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a lot of the kind of
aggressive Russian
tactics we have seen are aimed
at exactly

07:52.272 --> 07:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, be intimidating, be
unpredictable, and
your enemies will back off.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was some
dissension
among the ranks.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early in this morning, you
started getting
alerts on your phone that said
Foreign Minister

08:01.181 --> 08:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lavrov wanted to go ahead and
retaliate by
kicking out U.S. diplomats, and
then within

08:05.785 --> 08:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minutes, Vladimir Putin has
said, no, not
going to do that.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: I think the
Russians have really
got -- you have got to hand it
to them.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have become masters at the
art of surprise.

08:14.661 --> 08:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just, I guess, about 14 months
ago, you had
President Putin was coming to
the U.N. General

08:19.999 --> 08:21.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Assembly.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was going to be basically
isolated, not
get any meetings.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They announced their dramatic
military intervention
in Syria.

08:26.673 --> 08:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Russia was as at the
center of attention
and there was a showdown between
Obama and

08:31.277 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putin in New York.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is part of that same
script.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of the playbook where
if you force
surprises on people, you invade
Crimea, you

08:38.818 --> 08:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start a covert war in Ukraine,
suddenly the
world has to respond to the
facts that you're

08:42.856 --> 08:44.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
creating.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
prospects for
the relationship with the United
States?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, we don't
know.

08:48.595 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump has talked
about how
he's going to reset the reset,
he's going

08:51.731 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to team up with Russia to "knock
the hell
out of ISIL."

08:55.402 --> 08:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are what explains that are
sort of the
core interests that might unite
the United

08:59.839 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States and Russia.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm personally rather skeptical
that he's
going to be able to have those
kinds of quick

09:03.877 --> 09:05.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wins.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been many efforts
over the past
year or so between the Obama
administration

09:08.348 --> 09:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Russian government to
find some ways
to cooperate on the ground in
Syria.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have serious definitional
challenges, where
there are groups that the United
States has

09:15.655 --> 09:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supported on the ground in Syria
that the
Russians want to basically paint
with one

09:19.492 --> 09:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big brush and say, oh, they're
all terrorists.

09:21.428 --> 09:25.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's going to be
very hard, given
the corrosive mistrust between
the two governments.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's basically no trust left
between the
national security establishment,
the career

09:28.735 --> 09:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who will be serving under
a president-elect
Trump and their Russian
counterparts.

09:32.839 --> 09:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to be very hard to
build that
trust out of the barren
landscape that they're

09:37.243 --> 09:38.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inheriting.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What does that
win in Syria
or ISIL, what is the cost of
that?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it Crimea?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it Ukraine?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: We don't know.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far the price that
Russians have been
talking about in their
communications with

09:48.488 --> 09:49.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States are
exorbitant.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're saying the United States
should recognize
the annexation of Crimea.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying the United States
should pay
a penalty for the imposition of
economic sanctions

09:57.297 --> 10:01.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the shoot-down of a
civilian airliner
over Eastern Ukraine in July
2014.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are outlandish demands.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it would be unusual
to expect
that the Trump administration is
somehow going

10:07.140 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to grant those wishes.

10:08.975 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there
concerns that
the Trump administration doesn't
see the multiple

10:14.080 --> 10:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dimensions of Vladimir Putin?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, I think we
just don't
know.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that this is a
president-elect who
has very little foreign policy
experience.

10:21.354 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's tapped a neophyte to be his
secretary
of state, Rex Tillerson.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are people who have
records in the business
community.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got I think a lot of
credentials
in that area.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for the issues that have
been at the heart
of U.S.-Russian relations over
the past two-and-a-half

10:35.034 --> 10:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades and which have created
so mention
tension and so much built-up
resentment and

10:39.372 --> 10:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mistrust, it's not something
that they have
really had to deal with.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You called Rex
Tillerson
a neophyte.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a neophyte to government,
but not necessarily
to foreign affairs.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Technically, he might be the
person with the
most connections to Russia in
the Trump administration.

10:50.550 --> 10:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: There's no doubt
that Rex Tillerson's
access and accomplishments in
Russia are dramatic.

10:55.722 --> 11:01.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's come from a period of
working in Russia
at the highest levels going back
to the late

11:01.261 --> 11:02.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1990s.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He knows Putin personally.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knows Putin's top advisers
personally.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's all obviously a real
asset.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, does he know a
lot about
the IMF treaty, does he know a
lot about the

11:10.336 --> 11:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harassment of U.S. diplomatic
personnel, does
he follow Syria closely?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My sense is those are issues
that he has not
had to delve into in great
detail.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Weiss
from the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace, thanks

11:20.713 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for joining us.

11:21.714 --> 11:25.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW WEISS: Thank you.

11:25.885 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next to the
analysis of
Brooks and Corn.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated New York Times
columnist
David Brooks, and "Mother Jones"
Washington

11:39.499 --> 11:41.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bureau chief David Corn.

11:41.267 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, David Brooks, let's
start some
of the unilateral steps that
President Obama

11:45.204 --> 11:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has taken just in the last few
weeks.

11:47.173 --> 11:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are talking about everything
from the Russian
sanctions to the U.N. Security
Council condemnation

11:52.111 --> 11:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or allowing the U.N. Security
Council to
go forward in the condemnation
of the Israeli

11:56.215 --> 11:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
settlements, preserving large
swathes of land.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the paper of record, The New
York Times,
said, is this about boxing Trump
in?

12:01.821 --> 12:03.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I guess a little.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what can be done by a
president can be
undone by a president.

12:05.592 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's sort of remarkable is
that, especially
in the Israel and the Russia
cases, you have

12:09.228 --> 12:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a U.S. citizen, Donald
Trump, siding with
a foreign leader against the
U.S. president.

12:14.467 --> 12:19.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is a reason why
president-elects have
tried to remain mute during
their transitional

12:19.439 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
periods, relatively, because you
just don't
want to be for somebody -- some
other country

12:23.276 --> 12:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against your own government, and
especially
when you're about to take the
helm of that

12:26.713 --> 12:28.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will be a lot of
permanent people
who are just going to be stuck
there who are

12:31.351 --> 12:34.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now in a war between the
president-elect and
the guy they're currently
serving.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Corn,
does this violate
the spirit of that smooth
transition that

12:37.256 --> 12:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both gentlemen had that photo-op
in the White
House?

12:40.893 --> 12:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, President
Obama is still
president until January 20, and
the world

12:44.330 --> 12:46.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
keeps turning.

12:46.332 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Republicans wanted to
call his presidency
over last February, when he
nominated Merrick

12:51.270 --> 12:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Garland to the Supreme Court.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The U.N. sanction vote came up.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't scheduled by Obama.

12:59.145 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of people think he
should have responded
to the Russian hacking of the
U.S. elections

13:03.850 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weeks ago, months ago.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So these happened on his watch.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's nothing wrong with him
dealing with
it.

13:09.722 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump side now seems to be
whining that
he's violating the smooth
transition and trying

13:15.395 --> 13:17.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to delegitimize Trump.

13:17.230 --> 13:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But coming from Trump, who
pushed the racist
birth conspiracy theory for
years against

13:22.902 --> 13:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama, I think Obama has
been very
much a gentleman.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has a lot of reason to
just not even
bother to deal with Trump.

13:30.009 --> 13:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How different
is this from
previous presidents on their way
out?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it fairly traditional to
leave an exclamation
point at the end?

13:35.915 --> 13:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, it's kind of.

13:37.784 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, depending what is
happening -- when
George W. Bush left, he left
Barack Obama

13:42.955 --> 13:45.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two raging wars.

13:45.458 --> 13:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the biggest fight he had was
inside his
own government about whether or
not to pardon

13:50.730 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Scooter Libby.

13:52.598 --> 13:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was sort of consumed
fighting with
Dick Cheney about that, and
didn't do a lot

13:56.803 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think externally.

13:58.638 --> 14:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he was focused on
trying to, from
a national security perspective,
bring Obama

14:02.842 --> 14:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his people up to speed, so
they could
take control of these wars.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton had the controversy
with pardons
when he was walking out the
door, Marc Rich

14:11.284 --> 14:14.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and others, that certainly
tarnished his reputation.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think Obama is just doing
what he should
be doing at this point.

14:17.890 --> 14:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Brooks,
it almost
seems like there is a first 100
day strategy

14:21.527 --> 14:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and at the end of four or eight
years the
last hundred days, to do all the
things that

14:25.431 --> 14:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you wish you could have done,
but this is
on your way out.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is not abnormal.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at regulations that
come out of
White Houses, even Republican
White Houses,

14:32.872 --> 14:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is a ton right at the end
as they try
to jam everything in at the end.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's reasonably standard.

14:38.644 --> 14:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there certainly is a pattern
of administrations
that have good transitions,
George W. Bush

14:42.882 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to Barack Obama, and
administrations that
have really bad transitions, I
would say Eisenhower

14:46.753 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to John F. Kennedy.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say this is beginning to
look like
a bad transition, as they begin
to argue even

14:51.324 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the presidential level, which
is more or
less unprecedented.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's start
talking a little
bit about Russia.

14:55.461 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will the sanctions that we have
imposed keep
the Russian hackers out?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's so disproportionate.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They interfered in our
elections, and we like
penalized a few of them.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Whatever they're doing
underground, we don't
know.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, this is going to be a big
issue.

15:11.778 --> 15:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to say the Obama --
the Trump position
is, A, mystifying, but, B,
doomed.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a nice little Putin
romance going on
right now.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're going to get out
the hankies,
because this is going to turn
into an ugly

15:24.056 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship within a year or
two.

15:26.192 --> 15:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The things that make them
similar -- their
machismo, their expansionary
braggadocio -- is

15:31.464 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to turn them I think into
bitter and
dangerous enemies.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will look back on this moment
where we
thought Putin and Trump were
sort of close

15:37.970 --> 15:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a moment of bitter irony,
when they get
into a schoolyard display
against each other,

15:42.441 --> 15:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amping up each other's worst
tendencies and
putting the two countries in
some sort of

15:46.779 --> 15:48.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scary position.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's just my feel of how
things are going
to get in the next year.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID CORN: That may be the
best-case scenario.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't necessarily see things
going that
way.

15:55.822 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still am mystified, to use
your word, about
why Trump is out there tweeting
praise of

16:01.494 --> 16:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin these days, and
still kind
of denying and dismissing
whether the hacking

16:06.632 --> 16:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened or the seriousness of
it.

16:08.568 --> 16:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people out there keep
asking, what is
behind this bromance?

16:12.405 --> 16:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the election, I reported
on a story
about a counterintelligence
officer from another

16:17.677 --> 16:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service sending reports to the
FBI saying
that his sources in Russia were
saying that

16:23.583 --> 16:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moscow tried for years to
cultivate and co-opt
Donald Trump.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not saying that happened.

16:30.056 --> 16:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm saying I hope the FBI took a
strong look,
because it is really hard to
believe that

16:34.694 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a president-elect would be so
callous in how
he approaches this issue and so
dismissive

16:41.601 --> 16:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the seriousness of it.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so maybe he will turn on
Putin, as you
suggest, but maybe there is
something else

16:47.473 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there in which he is enamored
with Putin for
some reason that we really don't
understand

16:53.079 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
president-elect's
position that we have got to
move on, these

16:57.149 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are all essentially ploys to try
delegitimize
my win?

16:59.619 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, I think he
should be delegitimized
for many reasons.

17:04.223 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his response to this hacking
is also cause
for delegitimization.

17:09.362 --> 17:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to say we should move on,
when the bedrock
of American democracy, the
sanctity of our

17:15.601 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections, has been messed with,
just raises
suspicions.

17:19.005 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be so easy for him to
say the obvious
thing: This is terrible.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to look into it.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we're going to try to
prevent this
from happening again in the
future.

17:28.281 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his denial of it happening
or its seriousness
shows that there is something
really amiss

17:34.921 --> 17:36.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from his end of it.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Brooks,
what happens
in that conversation with
intelligence officials

17:38.958 --> 17:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump said he is
going to take
in order to get to the bottom of
this or get

17:42.995 --> 17:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a common set of facts?

17:45.097 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's already a fairly tense
relationship with
the intelligence community.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Of course I don't
know what's
going on in that meeting on in
the mind of

17:51.203 --> 17:52.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do know one of the things
President
Obama was struck by was how much
time he spent

17:55.308 --> 17:56.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on cyber-security as president.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was one of the big surprises
as president.

17:58.978 --> 18:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things he said
was that, in
the years ahead, the next
president will be

18:02.515 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spending even more time.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And cyber-security isn't a thing
that goes
away after this election.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a constant flow.

18:08.788 --> 18:13.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Russia has a very
sophisticated, advanced
attack on U.S. businesses and
U.S. government

18:13.092 --> 18:14.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and U.S. institutions.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not like Donald Trump
is going to
be walking away from this.

18:17.396 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will be spending a lot of
time on it, if
he's any sort of normal
president.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, maybe, but we
don't know.

18:22.001 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He keeps dismissing the
seriousness and even
tweets out or puts a statement
saying, you

18:27.373 --> 18:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, computers, it's kind of
complicated.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, a lot of things
happen.

18:31.410 --> 18:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It remains to be seen what he is
serious about
on any policy level.

18:36.983 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, speaking
of policy
level, one of the things that we
saw was that

18:41.520 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.N. Security Council was
allowed to go
forward with the condemnation of
Israeli settlements,

18:45.624 --> 18:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the United States didn't
use its veto
power.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Right move?

18:50.129 --> 18:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: I think it's a
policy that's very
defensible, in that, right now,
the settlements

18:55.234 --> 18:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are a complete obstacle or a
threat to a two-state
solution.

18:59.872 --> 19:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I think Netanyahu and the
far right of
Israel don't believe in a
two-state solution,

19:06.045 --> 19:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they just can't come out and
say it yet.

19:07.880 --> 19:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Donald Trump's designated
ambassador
to Israel has said that quite
clearly.

19:12.952 --> 19:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if there's no two-state
solution, then
Israel is on the path to being
an occupying

19:18.224 --> 19:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation without full political
rights for all
its inhabitants.

19:21.894 --> 19:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there have been
other Israeli
leaders who have talked about
the prospect

19:26.198 --> 19:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a form of apartheid in
Israel.

19:28.734 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the Obama position
and the majority
position of American Jews and a
lot of Americans

19:34.240 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a two-state solution.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Settlements get in the way of
that.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they're not stopped soon,
there is no prospect
for that type of solution.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Now we disagree.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's a completely
indefensible policy.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Settlements are an obstacle to
peace and to
a two-state solution.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no question about that.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are about the fifth or
sixth most important
obstacle right now.

19:52.425 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that there could be an
ISIS West
Bank, the fact that the
Palestinian government

19:56.495 --> 20:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Gaza doesn't even acknowledge
Israel's
right to exist, the fact of
constant terror,

20:00.833 --> 20:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegitimization campaigns in
the Palestinian
schools, these are all much
bigger facts.

20:05.071 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the Obama administration
to focus
on this one fact, almost, not to
the expense,

20:11.010 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but to diminish some of the
others which are
much more important, is to cast
all the blame

20:15.147 --> 20:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Israel and to take the U.N.
policy toward
Israel, which has been
longstanding, and sort

20:19.718 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of surrender to it.

20:21.620 --> 20:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Netanyahu, Bibi Netanyahu, froze
the settlements
and offered to go toward a
two-state solution.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Palestinians didn't take him
up on it.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Historically, we have had a
series of these
offers.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the settlements themselves
are not the
keystone here.

20:34.033 --> 20:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to me myopic and
bizarre that
at the last moment, the Obama
administration

20:38.704 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would surrender the whole
balanced array of
policies that are obstacles to
peace and focus

20:44.009 --> 20:45.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the one that is most
detrimental to Israel.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, I think John
Kerry's speech
was not just about settlements.

20:49.181 --> 20:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was about the whole large
path to peace
and what's been happening to it.

20:53.619 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was one of the -- I think
one of the
most thorough policy statements
that you have

20:57.790 --> 21:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen from any secretary of state
on a contentious
issue.

21:00.860 --> 21:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think that it's not just
myopia.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vote obviously was not
scheduled by the
administration.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm sure they would rather it
had not happened.

21:10.236 --> 21:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think they also wanted to
send a clear
signal, because they don't
believe Netanyahu

21:14.907 --> 21:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is serious about a two-state
solution.

21:18.344 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the rapid expansion of the
settlements
is something that actually could
be stopped,

21:23.149 --> 21:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and may not even be up for
negotiation, but
would be a good unilateral move
on Israel's

21:27.853 --> 21:29.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
part.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
choice of
David Friedman as the
ambassador?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does that do to the
situation?

21:33.225 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, that just
shows how polarized
the whole situation has become,
because the

21:36.462 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration has focused
the onus
on Israel and the settlements.

21:40.065 --> 21:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the Trump potential
administration
apparently is pro-settlement,
and almost against

21:45.538 --> 21:47.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a two-state solution.

21:47.339 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we have got two polar
opposite Israel policies,
which really break what had been
a pretty

21:53.078 --> 21:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decent bipartisan consensus that
we have got
to have a two-state solution, we
sort of know

21:56.315 --> 21:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the border is going to look
like, we
sort of know what East Jerusalem
is going

21:59.385 --> 22:01.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to look like.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no administration has ever
said, as the
Obama administration sort of
implied, that

22:03.923 --> 22:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel wouldn't have access to
the Western
Wall, to the East Jerusalem.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that was also in the
resolution.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all administrations have not
really gone
on the U.N. train.

22:13.732 --> 22:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we're seeing is a
complete bifurcation
to two wrong Israeli policies.

22:17.403 --> 22:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
finally, staying
in the neighborhood, does it
matter that the

22:20.739 --> 22:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. is not a part of whatever
this cease-fire
in Syria is at the moment?

22:26.212 --> 22:30.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it
matters, in that,
if you withdraw from the game,
you're out

22:30.683 --> 22:31.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the game.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have withdrawn from the
game.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we said Assad has to go.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's going to stay.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we're out of the game.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they don't have to deal us
in when it
comes to finding a solution.

22:38.757 --> 22:39.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that was our choice.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was our choice to withdraw
from that
particular game.

22:41.827 --> 22:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: We were behind two
cease-fires
this year, one in February that
lasted a few

22:46.265 --> 22:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months, and one in September
that lasted about
a week.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have no idea how long this is
going to
last.

22:52.071 --> 22:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a great possibility that
some on the
rebel side will start fighting
amongst themselves,

22:57.376 --> 23:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because some of the rebel
groups, the more
fundamentalist, are not part of
the cease-fire.

23:03.749 --> 23:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if there is anything that
stops the fighting
and stops the civilian
casualties, that's

23:08.754 --> 23:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a good thing now for a pause.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm not very optimistic this
is going
to last.

23:14.026 --> 23:17.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think John Kerry has
tried awfully
hard to work with Russia and
others to have

23:17.730 --> 23:19.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lasting, significant
cease-fire.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Corn of
"Mother Jones," David Brooks of
The New York

23:22.568 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Times, David and David, thank
you very much.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Happy new year.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Happy new
year.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

23:40.352 --> 23:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
another look
at the newest edition to the
National Mall:

23:44.790 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the National Museum of African
American History
and Culture; and songwriter Josh
Ritter opens

23:49.428 --> 23:52.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up about the doubt he feels on
stage.

23:52.164 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: a broader look at
music and some
of the best work of this past
year.

23:57.903 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we say goodbye to 2016, we
also finish
our week-long series on the best
of arts.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is our guide once
again.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of all the
popular art forms
we have talked about this week,
delving into

24:08.180 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the huge and diverse world of
music necessarily
means touching on just a slice
of the large

24:13.385 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pie.

24:15.087 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two music critics are here to
help us with
some of their own best of the
year.

24:18.357 --> 24:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ann Powers of NPR and Mikael
Wood of The Los
Angeles Times.

24:22.394 --> 24:23.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ann, let's just start with -- a
few albums
really dominated the year.

24:27.366 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We might as well start there.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS, NPR: Absolutely.

24:30.769 --> 24:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Beyonce's "Lemonade" was a
multimedia
phenomenon with the visual side,
a wonderful

24:37.409 --> 24:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
album and people talked about it
all year,
very political album.

24:50.956 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right next to that was David
Bowie's "Blackstar"
as equally lauded and
celebrated.

24:56.695 --> 24:59.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, we lost David Bowie
this year.

24:59.064 --> 25:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it was an interesting mix of
a young artist
at the top of her game and an
elder making

25:04.536 --> 25:07.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a final statement.

25:07.106 --> 25:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mikael Wood,
let's start to
fill out your list here.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Give us a few of your -- what
stood out for
you.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKAEL WOOD, The Los Angeles
Times: Beyonce
and Bowie are both on my list.

25:22.254 --> 25:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have also got the young
country singer
Maren Morris, who was doing a
lot of interesting

25:26.992 --> 25:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, sort of taking country
into an old-fashioned
way, but also making it very
contemporary

25:30.963 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the same time.

25:35.934 --> 25:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had a couple of great
hip-hop records
from Kanye West, who everybody
knows, of course,

25:42.641 --> 25:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but a younger rapper too from
Chicago called
Chance the Rapper, who made a
sort of gospel

25:48.414 --> 25:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rap record that's very personal,
but also
sort of clearly situated in his
hometown and

25:54.386 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of its various struggles,
really interesting
record.

25:59.124 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so,
Ann, I made
you start with the ones
everybody knows.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But fill out a little more of
your top five
list or so.

26:16.842 --> 26:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS: Well, speaking of
country singers,
there's a wonderful young singer
out of Nashville,

26:23.148 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Margo Price, who made a very
traditional country
record called "Midwest Farmer's
Daughter,"

26:28.921 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with contemporary verb and
voice.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's one of my favorites
of the year.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That has a good
title, too,
right, "Midwest Farmer's
Daughter."

26:36.528 --> 26:37.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANN POWERS: Yes.

26:37.529 --> 26:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is a Midwest farmer's
daughter.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jack White's record label
Third Man put
it out.

26:41.967 --> 26:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it is country and cool.

26:53.078 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really love Chance the Rapper,
which Mikael
mentioned.

26:56.114 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Beyonce's sister Solange
Knowles released
a very beautiful, introspective
album called

27:02.788 --> 27:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A Seat at the Table" that again
reflected
the political moment in a very
different way.

27:08.126 --> 27:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Beyonce was forceful and out
there, Solange
was quiet and thinking and
meditating and

27:13.832 --> 27:15.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dreaming.

27:15.234 --> 27:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was actually NPR
Music's number one
record of the year.

27:20.906 --> 27:33.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Mikael, so
we're talking.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to bring in performances.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking mostly about
recordings.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But is there a performance or
two that stood
out for you this year?

27:39.958 --> 27:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKAEL WOOD: I think Beyonce at
the Super
Bowl was -- just sort of blew
everybody...

27:44.596 --> 27:46.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: She's
inescapable, isn't she,
in this conversation, right?

27:46.431 --> 27:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKAEL WOOD: Oh, she's the
essence of inescapability.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, think of it like this.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't actually's Beyonce's
Super Bowl
this year.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was Coldplay's.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's right.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKAEL WOOD: And all anybody
remembers is
Beyonce, which shows you how she
stole the

27:57.876 --> 27:58.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think Adele's tour as well.

28:00.112 --> 28:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw her here in L.A. And what
an interesting
tour.

28:04.716 --> 28:12.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a year when pop was
technologically forward-looking
and engaged with politics, here
comes Adele

28:12.391 --> 28:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with just a super old-fashioned
show.

28:15.894 --> 28:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw her in the same week that
I saw Barbra
Streisand.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the two had some very --
real similarities.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's standing on the stage with
a sort of
small orchestra.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She wears one dress throughout
the night.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's very little spectacle.

28:27.773 --> 28:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's just standing there
singing these incredible
songs and making a huge impact
with all her

28:33.979 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tens of thousands of people who
came to see
her, just an outlier, but also
so interestingly

28:39.451 --> 28:41.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
old-fashioned.

28:41.920 --> 28:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ann Powers, some
performances
you saw?

28:49.127 --> 28:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS: Well, actually,
along similar
lines to Adele, I think the
Dixie Chicks'

28:53.498 --> 28:59.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comeback was a huge story of the
year, again,
not a technological, futuristic
show, but

28:59.404 --> 29:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a triumphant return of a band
who had, of
course, been somewhat banished
from country

29:06.545 --> 29:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music after their lead singer,
Natalie Maines,
had made some remarks about then
President

29:11.617 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
George W. Bush.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have come back, roaring
back.

29:15.153 --> 29:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw them play here, a hometown
show, tens
of thousands of people, mostly
women, singing

29:20.158 --> 29:21.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along.

29:21.893 --> 29:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of course, the Dixie Chicks,
because I
got to mention her again,
brought Beyonce

29:25.130 --> 29:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on at CMA Awards to do Beyonce's
song "Daddy
Lessons," and that was maybe the
televised

29:31.303 --> 29:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment of the year, really just
a super women
power moment.

29:38.710 --> 29:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about --
Mikael, I will
start with you on this -- that
when you think

29:48.920 --> 29:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about trends in the music world,
and, again,
Beyonce, we will have to mention
her, because

29:53.659 --> 29:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this continuing evolution of the
distribution
of music, she was part of that
this year,

29:58.830 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but other people, too.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKAEL WOOD: Yes.

30:01.767 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, streaming, this -- 2016 was
the year that
streaming became the dominant
sort of way

30:05.904 --> 30:09.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that people are experiencing
music, at least
young people.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you saw that with record
after record,
whether it was Kanye, whether it
was Beyonce,

30:12.744 --> 30:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether it was Rihanna, whether
it was Drake.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People were finding out about
music and listening
to it, engaging with it through
streaming.

30:19.851 --> 30:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will sort of see where that
takes everything.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will sort of see what that
does to the
way people listen.

30:25.824 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was just absolutely no
doubt that
that was the dominant
distribution model this

30:30.662 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

30:32.631 --> 30:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it leads to all kinds
of interesting
conversations about, you know,
various exclusives.

30:36.301 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The singer Frank Ocean, for
instance, you
could only go to one place to
hear his record,

30:40.439 --> 30:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which just sort of changes the
whole economy
of pop music, which I think is
going to be

30:44.943 --> 30:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
huge in the next few years.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Ann,
finally, just the
one thing you alluded to with
the passing

30:50.015 --> 30:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of David Bowie, but this was a
year in which
a number of major musicians,
major stars were

30:56.588 --> 30:57.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lost.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN POWERS: Absolutely, Bowie's
death at the
beginning of the year.

30:59.991 --> 31:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, the greatest musician
of my generation,
Prince, died this year, and
we're still feeling

31:05.497 --> 31:07.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

31:07.299 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leonard Cohen, we lost, and many
others, the
soul singer Sharon Jones, Guy
Clark, Merle

31:12.237 --> 31:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haggard here in the country
world in Nashville.

31:15.507 --> 31:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one great thing about when
we mourn these
singers is that we also
celebrate and archive

31:22.447 --> 31:23.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their work.

31:23.448 --> 31:24.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we're seeing that.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is more David Bowie
material available
online than ever before.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, though he is lost, his music
lives on.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are preserving it as
fans.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that, to me, is a great
legacy.

31:34.793 --> 31:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, music
of the past
and of 2016.

31:39.197 --> 31:42.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ann Powers of NPR, Mikael Wood
of The L.A.
Times, thank you both very much.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS: Thanks so much.

31:44.770 --> 31:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKAEL WOOD: Happy to do it.

31:53.145 --> 31:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we close
out 2016, we
have been thinking of the loss
of our friend

31:59.251 --> 32:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and colleague Gwen Ifill.

32:01.052 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of her favorite stories
of the past
year was the opening of the
widely acclaimed

32:04.856 --> 32:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Museum of African
American History
and Culture.

32:07.826 --> 32:12.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a reprise of that story,
Gwen in the
field doing what she loved to do
and having

32:12.297 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fun in the process.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY, Museum Donor: We
can see she
has her camera right there.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was one of her photographic
days.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joyce Bailey's
legacy turned out
to be worth more than money.

32:23.975 --> 32:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her mother, Lois Alexander Lane
left her a
treasure trove from the museum
she created,

32:29.848 --> 32:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Harlem Institute of Fashion,
costumes,
dresses sewn and worn by slaves,
celebrities

32:36.922 --> 32:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and by civil rights icons.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things I think people
are surprised
to know, or to remember, is that
Rosa Parks

32:43.595 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a seamstress.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY: Yes, she was.

32:46.531 --> 32:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was actually carrying the
dress that the
museum now has on the day that
she was arrested.

32:51.703 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a beautiful yellow with
brown stripes
in it.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's beyond belief.

32:58.243 --> 33:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You really just have to see it.

33:00.178 --> 33:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Beginning this
weekend, thousands
of people will stream into the
brand-new National

33:04.883 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Museum of African American
History and Culture
to see elements of Bailey's
collection and

33:10.155 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countless other priceless items.

33:12.824 --> 33:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is this, an airplane flown
cross-country
to the museum once piloted by
the all-black

33:18.430 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuskegee Airmen, the casket of
14-year-old
Emmett Till, lynched in 1955 for
whistling

33:25.203 --> 33:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a white woman, the writings
of abolitionist
Frederick Douglass, shackles
discovered on

33:30.475 --> 33:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sunken ship that brought
hundreds of slaves
to America, and from a South
Carolina plantation,

33:37.215 --> 33:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fully restored slave cabin,
the dress Marian
Anderson wore when she sang at
the Lincoln

33:43.321 --> 33:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Memorial, and costumes from "The
Wiz," the
all-black Broadway musical based
on "The Wizard

33:48.793 --> 33:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Oz," donated from Joyce
Bailey's collection.

33:52.664 --> 33:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is as an amazing place,
chockful of the
expected and the expected.

33:57.736 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One thing missing, major
artifacts from the
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.

34:02.207 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His family apparently decided to
hold onto
some of the most famous
memorabilia, including

34:07.612 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bible that President Obama
used to take
the oath of office in 2013.

34:13.418 --> 34:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In any case, it fell to museum
director Lonnie
Bunch and his band of curators
to sort through

34:18.957 --> 34:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what turned into a rush of
donations.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH, Director, National
Museum of
African American History and
Culture: But,

34:21.993 --> 34:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I saw them, I said, we are
going to tell
that story.

34:24.963 --> 34:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just love, from "The Wiz,"
I just love
how they look.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just think they're so
distinctive.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They obviously speak volumes
about Geoffrey
Holder.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The designer.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: The designer.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, plus, they're just so
beautiful.

34:38.343 --> 34:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It was a big moment
at the time.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Absolutely.

34:41.146 --> 34:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From sobering
memorabilia like
rebellion leader Nat Turner's
Bible, to 20th

34:44.749 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century musical memories, Chuck
Berry's cherry
red Cadillac, and Parliament
Funkadelic's

34:50.522 --> 34:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
iconic Mothership, here lit up
and sheathed
in plastic in preparation for
the opening.

34:56.628 --> 35:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: During concerts,
it would come
down, and George Clinton would
get out.

35:00.665 --> 35:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it'd be this notion that he
was from another
planet.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:04.736 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which he kind of
was.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Which he still is.

35:07.572 --> 35:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The $540 million
project, a century
in the making, and the first
green museum

35:11.643 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the National Mall, captures
the sweep of
African-American history.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what do we have here?

35:17.415 --> 35:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: This is one of my
great treasures.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What I love is what my staff is
able to find.

35:23.588 --> 35:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a playbill from
Newcastle, England,
in 1857 that is from Ira
Aldridge's career.

35:30.228 --> 35:34.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ira Aldridge, the great black
thespian that
couldn't get jobs in the United
States as

35:34.432 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a great actor, classical actor,
had to go
to Europe.

35:36.935 --> 35:40.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Othello, who
everyone now thinks
of as a character always played
by a black

35:40.405 --> 35:41.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actor.

35:41.406 --> 35:42.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LONNIE BUNCH: Exactly.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it was always in blackface.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Galleries are
devoted to breakthroughs
in sports and performance.

35:46.044 --> 35:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: The joy of Prince,
and I love
the Michael Jackson fedora.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just capture that.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, the "Soul Train"
costume.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: "Soul Train" costume
is a little
alarming.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:57.655 --> 35:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Well, it is,
because we thought
that was cool.

35:58.890 --> 35:59.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: We.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know about we.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:02.127 --> 36:03.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Speak for yourself.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:04.195 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is cool.

36:06.131 --> 36:09.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bunch, a former president of the
Chicago Historical
Society, shepherded the project
to completion,

36:09.868 --> 36:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wooing Congress for half the
money, and soliciting
private donations from
millionaires like Oprah

36:15.507 --> 36:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winfrey and philanthropist David
Rubenstein.

36:18.810 --> 36:25.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he also appealed to
individuals, families,
churches, fraternities and
sororities, who

36:25.183 --> 36:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handed over gems like James
Baldwin's inkwell
and Malcolm X's tape recorder.

36:31.556 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Advance tickets flew out the
door, 5,000 of
them in 18 minutes one day.

36:37.028 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this journey you have been to
get to this
point with this museum, what has
been the

36:41.666 --> 36:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest surprise for you along
the way?

36:43.468 --> 36:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I think I have
been stunned
by the excitement and the way
people really

36:47.072 --> 36:48.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are times I will walk in
an airport
and people will just sort of
give me the thumbs

36:52.310 --> 36:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, or I will walk down the
street and church
ladies will come to me and say
they're praying

36:56.981 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the fact that this
means so much
to so many people has been the
biggest surprise

37:02.420 --> 37:04.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

37:04.389 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As with other
Smithsonian museums,
one building cannot begin to
hold its collection.

37:09.327 --> 37:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservator Antje Neumann has
helped preserve
the collection at the museum's
facility in

37:14.365 --> 37:16.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Washington suburb.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTJE NEUMANN, Conservator,
National Museum
of African American History and
Culture: There's

37:17.969 --> 37:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always the balance between
preservation and
exhibition, and allowing the
public to see

37:23.241 --> 37:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the national treasures, and then
also balancing
that with preserving it for
future generations.

37:28.480 --> 37:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's lovely to have a place to
highlight the
struggles, the causes and the
progression

37:35.053 --> 37:38.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that many people and the
contributions many
people have done in this
country.

37:39.023 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It falls to Neumann
to repair
Shaquille O'Neal's size 20 shoe,
to prepare

37:44.062 --> 37:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a stool from Muhammad Ali's gym,
to restore
worn pages of the first book of
black poetry,

37:50.768 --> 37:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to spiff up funk singer
Bootsy Collins'
bright yellow leather costume.

37:54.906 --> 37:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTJE NEUMANN: It just needs a
bit -- a little
bit of cleaning in order to make
it ready

37:59.544 --> 38:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for presentation, as it has been
used a lot
on stage.

38:03.381 --> 38:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Collins' outfit
occupies a place
of honor inside the new
building, which is

38:08.319 --> 38:10.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a work of art itself.

38:10.188 --> 38:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The corona, the signature
exterior feature,
is made of 230 tons of
bronze-colored aluminum

38:17.462 --> 38:20.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
panels, 3,600 in all.

38:20.732 --> 38:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lead architect Phil Freelon
oversaw the building's
striking design.

38:24.135 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL FREELON, Lead Architect:
Many of the
buildings on the Mall are
marble, granite,

38:28.806 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concrete, lighter in color.

38:31.276 --> 38:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This building has a variation in
how it appears.

38:34.779 --> 38:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on certain days, in certain
lighting conditions,
it can be very vibrant and
bright.

38:39.584 --> 38:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other times of the day or in
the evening,
it is darker.

38:43.788 --> 38:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is this interesting
dynamic of changing
appearance of the building.

38:49.027 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Within view, the
Washington Monument
and even a glimpse of the White
House, which

38:54.866 --> 38:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michelle Obama famously noted
was itself built
by slaves.

38:59.437 --> 39:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bunch says this makes race an
integral part
of the American experience.

39:04.142 --> 39:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this country, we are so
nervous about
talking about race, about
engaging.

39:09.080 --> 39:13.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We keep having national
conversations about
race, and it seems that this
building itself

39:13.384 --> 39:15.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a big conversation.

39:15.486 --> 39:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you -- did you encounter
along the way
any resistance to the notion
that we talk

39:19.424 --> 39:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about Americans only by race?

39:21.859 --> 39:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I think there was
fear that
we would be a place that might
be divisive,

39:29.734 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people wouldn't want to
talk about race,
and that we would force them to
talk about

39:34.539 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

39:36.374 --> 39:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there was a great
concern that, would
this just be a museum by black
people for

39:42.013 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
black people?

39:43.815 --> 39:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we had to counter
that, both by
the kind of stories we told, by
the way we

39:48.486 --> 39:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried to say, this is a story of
America through
an African-American lens.

39:53.391 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joyce Bailey's
mother could not
have foreseen this day, but she
did see the

39:57.662 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
value of preserving black
history.

40:00.632 --> 40:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lois Alexander passed away in
2007, leaving
her daughter with a window into
history.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But didn't you feel a little
emotional about
letting it go?

40:09.841 --> 40:15.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY: I was very happy
about letting
it go, because I knew my
mother's legacy would

40:15.213 --> 40:16.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Curators think about
legacy too.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lonnie Bunch is still looking
ahead.

40:20.885 --> 40:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I want to make
sure that curators
50 years from now can tell the
story of today,

40:25.456 --> 40:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if that's what they want to
tell.

40:27.325 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I hope this museum will
continue to evolve,
continue to change, because it
really has

40:33.398 --> 40:38.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a place that is the great
convener,
that can bring anybody and
everybody into

40:38.536 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a conversation around race.

40:40.738 --> 40:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From groundbreaking
in 2012 to
open doors this week, America
preserved, America

40:53.117 --> 40:56.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
celebrated, right in the
nation's front yard.

40:56.354 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The story
originally aired
in September, one of Gwen's
favorites and

41:02.193 --> 41:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of our favorite stories from
2016.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of our favorite stories from
2016.

41:17.542 --> 41:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We looked at the best books of
2016 earlier
this week, and both our guests
agreed a standout

41:23.414 --> 41:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year was a book that
examined the cascading
impact poverty has on housing.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeff is back with this reprise.

41:30.888 --> 41:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Every year in
this country,
families are evicted from their
homes, not

41:34.726 --> 41:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the tens of thousands or by
the hundreds
of thousands, but by the
millions, that from

41:39.464 --> 41:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new book that explores a huge,
but little
discussed phenomenon in America
today.

41:44.335 --> 41:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in
the American
City" follows the lives of eight
Milwaukee

41:49.507 --> 41:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
families, black and white.

41:50.908 --> 41:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Author Matthew Desmond lived
among them in
2008 to 2009.

41:54.612 --> 42:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a sociologist, a professor
at Harvard
and a winner of a MacArthur
Fellowship last

42:00.318 --> 42:01.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND, Author,
"Evicted: Poverty
and Profit in the American
City": Thank you.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eviction is far
more prevalent
than most people think and far
less part of

42:07.024 --> 42:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the discussion around poverty in
this country.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do you think that's the
case?

42:11.162 --> 42:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I think we
focus a lot on
jobs.

42:13.097 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We focus a lot on mass
incarceration and welfare
reform.

42:16.334 --> 42:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But housing has been left out of
the debate
a little bit.

42:19.537 --> 42:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have focused on public
housing, and we
have focused on neighborhoods,
but the private

42:23.741 --> 42:28.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rental market, where a vast
majority of low-income
families are living, has been
largely overlooked.

42:29.013 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here is this market that's
taking most
of what low-income families are
making.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's a...

42:34.185 --> 42:35.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:35.453 --> 42:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An incredible
amount, percentage
of income.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, that's really striking.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

42:39.257 --> 42:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Seventy, 80, 90
percent.

42:41.025 --> 42:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes, that's
what I saw when
I was living with families in
Milwaukee.

42:42.794 --> 42:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we reached a point today
that we know
that the majority of low-income
renters are

42:46.097 --> 42:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying most of what they have
just on rent
and to keep the lights on.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I said you
followed eight families.

42:51.969 --> 42:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pick one person to explain sort
of how people
fall into this and how hard it
is to get out

42:56.874 --> 42:57.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

42:57.875 --> 42:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes, yes.

42:58.876 --> 42:59.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm thinking of Arlene.

42:59.877 --> 43:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, Arlene was a single
mom.

43:00.878 --> 43:02.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She had two young boys.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I met her, she was
living in a pretty
run-down apartment in a
low-income neighborhood

43:05.650 --> 43:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and giving 88 percent of her
income on rent.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she was facing terrible
choices.

43:11.389 --> 43:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, should I buy food or
pay the rent?

43:14.258 --> 43:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Should I contribute some money
to the funeral
or pay the rent?

43:17.161 --> 43:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And someone like Arlene,
eviction isn't necessarily
the result of irresponsibility.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's more inevitable.

43:23.968 --> 43:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're making
some bad choices,
but you're showing how it's a
kind of -- almost

43:27.405 --> 43:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vicious cycle, right, of the
eviction playing
into those choices.

43:30.942 --> 43:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: If you're
someone like Arlene
that's paying almost everything
you have to

43:34.645 --> 43:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the landlord, a very small
divergence can
invite an eviction.

43:38.816 --> 43:43.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The book opens with her
14-year-old hitting
a car with a snowball, you know,
and the man

43:43.287 --> 43:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jumping out, kicking in the
door, and that
causing the landlord to evict
the family.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was that a bad choice?

43:49.260 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eviction isn't just a condition
of poverty.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's also a cause of it.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's making things worse.

43:54.499 --> 43:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You show the
rawness of what
an eviction -- I mean, you
capture what it

43:57.835 --> 43:58.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looks like.

43:58.836 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes.

43:59.837 --> 44:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Describe that.

44:01.739 --> 44:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, take an example of what
perhaps struck
you even the first time you
actually saw what

44:05.009 --> 44:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's like, when you see
everything thrown
out of the house.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I remember
seeing Arlene
get evicted in early January.

44:11.549 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the coldest day on record
in Milwaukee.

44:14.085 --> 44:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the weathermen said it
would be
40 degrees below with the
windchill.

44:20.057 --> 44:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And seeing a family's things
piled on a curb,
seeing children forced from
their homes, seeing

44:27.198 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things taken by movers and
put in bonded
storage, and often, kind of,
taken to the

44:31.302 --> 44:36.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dump when families can't keep up
with those
payments, it's a violent act,
eviction.

44:36.374 --> 44:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can leave a deep mark.

44:37.742 --> 44:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know it leaves a mark on
families that
experience it.

44:41.546 --> 44:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It leaves a mark
in terms of,
obviously, their budget, but a
psychological

44:46.450 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mark is what you're really
documenting.

44:47.985 --> 44:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes, that's
absolutely right.

44:49.387 --> 44:51.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It affects your spirit.

44:51.322 --> 44:55.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we know that mothers
who are evicted,
two years later have higher
rates of depression.

44:55.493 --> 45:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that suicides attributed
to evictions
or foreclosures doubled between
2005 and 2010.

45:01.098 --> 45:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, eviction not only causes you
to lose your
home and your things and your
community, but

45:05.736 --> 45:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also has deep effects on the way
you see yourself
and your mental health.

45:09.440 --> 45:14.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also got a
couple of landlords
to talk to you and let you
follow them around.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I thought that
was crucial.

45:15.813 --> 45:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought, if I really wanted to
understand
how housing is causing poverty
in America,

45:20.017 --> 45:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I needed to get landlords'
perspectives.

45:21.586 --> 45:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't understand why they
evicted me, but
not you.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I needed to understand what
makes them tick.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is a business model at
the bottom
of the market.

45:29.460 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one thing I found that
surprised me
was that landlords that are
operating in very

45:33.464 --> 45:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor neighborhoods can make a
decent profit,
an extreme profit in some cases.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The eviction
becomes part of
the profit, right?

45:40.137 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it can be -- it can be
beneficial
to them to evict somebody, bring
somebody

45:45.509 --> 45:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else in, not put much into the
actual rental
property.

45:48.713 --> 45:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: That's right.

45:50.481 --> 45:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some landlords, eviction
is costly,
and it does take money, but, for
others, it's

45:53.951 --> 45:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the business model.

45:55.686 --> 46:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the short answer to that is,
it's more
efficient to evict a family than
to keep up

46:01.025 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
payments or to keep up
maintenance on your
property.

46:04.462 --> 46:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can do that because
families are so
strapped, they're giving so much
of their

46:08.699 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
income to rent, that if they
call a building
inspector or report a housing
problem, landlords

46:13.671 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can evict that family, not
because retaliatory
evictions are legal, but because
you can,

46:18.776 --> 46:20.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at any time, evict a family who
are behind.

46:20.478 --> 46:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also write
about your own
experience in doing this, right?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Right.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trying to see how
they live,
almost trying to live as they
live.

46:27.652 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you feel satisfied in the
end with what
you were able to do?

46:31.522 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you also write in the
afterwards of
how heartbreaking a lot of this
was to see,

46:35.660 --> 46:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and even the personal toll it
took on you.

46:37.561 --> 46:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I learned not
only about
pain and denial of basic human
needs, but

46:42.299 --> 46:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also learned about humor, and
strength and
courage in the face of massive
adversity.

46:48.372 --> 46:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it did have an effect on my
life, personally.

46:50.675 --> 46:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the stories that I
write about
also buoyed me, you know, and
left me with

46:56.614 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a deep sense of thankfulness and
just an impression
that people that I met in
Milwaukee refuse

47:03.354 --> 47:05.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be reduced to their
hardships.

47:05.189 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're so much more than that,
but the extent
of poverty in our cities today
is reducing

47:11.529 --> 47:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people born for better things.

47:13.464 --> 47:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
finally, about
what should be done.

47:16.267 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do, at the end, advocate for
a few things,
including creating a kind of
universal housing

47:21.172 --> 47:22.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voucher.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would be the single most
important thing
you would like to see happen?

47:25.309 --> 47:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I think we, as
a nation,
need to figure out, do we
believe that housing

47:29.413 --> 47:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a right in this country?

47:32.149 --> 47:36.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that we should
answer yes, because,
without stable, decent housing,
everything

47:36.554 --> 47:38.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else falls apart.

47:38.489 --> 47:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think taking this program
that's already
working, housing vouchers, so
instead of paying

47:41.692 --> 47:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
88 percent of your income to
rent, Arlene
would only pay 30 percent of her
income, and

47:46.263 --> 47:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she could take that voucher
anywhere she wants,
as long as her housing isn't too
expensive

47:49.467 --> 47:50.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or too shoddy.

47:50.935 --> 47:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would fundamentally change
the face of
poverty in America today.

47:54.605 --> 47:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could make evictions rare
again, and decrease
family homelessness, but only if
we, as a

47:58.809 --> 48:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, kind of accept the fact
that housing
is central to human flourishing
and economic

48:05.449 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mobility.

48:07.318 --> 48:09.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Evicted:
Poverty and Profit in the
American City."

48:09.720 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matthew Desmond, thank you so
much.

48:14.925 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Thanks for
having me.

48:20.965 --> 48:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Songwriter
Josh Ritter didn't
make our critics' list of the
best of 2016,

48:26.537 --> 48:31.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he also had a good year, on
tour and recording
music for the movie "The
Hollars."

48:31.075 --> 48:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up with Ritter in
Washington playing
at the 9:30 Club in our latest
edition of

48:35.412 --> 48:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMHO: In My Humble Opinion.

48:41.752 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH RITTER, Musician: I have
been writing
songs and playing music for
almost 20 years.

48:51.796 --> 49:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH RITTER, Musician: I have
been writing
songs and playing music for
almost 20 years.

49:02.339 --> 49:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began in my childhood bedroom,
moved to
open mics and then to opening
for larger artists.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I get to play my own
shows in venues
around the world.

49:10.714 --> 49:20.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not Rihanna, but I have
always considered
myself to have

49:20.257 --> 49:24.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a healthy, growing career.

49:24.662 --> 49:33.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
I
get to make the music I want to
make with

49:33.470 --> 49:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the people I want to make it.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have sold out some theaters
you have heard
of.

49:36.974 --> 49:40.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my family and I are able to
live a comfortable
life.

49:40.411 --> 49:43.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Enjoy this time, those close to
me say.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all happening for you.

49:45.182 --> 49:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet, at the strangest
moments, I find
it impossible to do anything of
the sort.

49:50.221 --> 49:54.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the middle of a show,
sometimes in the
middle of applause itself, I
find myself certain

49:54.692 --> 49:58.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that my wonderful audience will
suddenly realize
that I'm a fake and that my
music has been

49:58.796 --> 50:00.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrible all along.

50:00.664 --> 50:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will their collective come
during the show
itself, causing a slow
hemorrhage of silhouettes

50:04.635 --> 50:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passing through the exits never
to return,
or will people be kinder, stay
dutifully to

50:09.940 --> 50:14.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end and then shake their
heads softly
with friends as they trail down
the street?

50:14.178 --> 50:15.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What of my band?

50:15.980 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What of the people I work with?

50:17.615 --> 50:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How long until they see that I'm
a sham?

50:20.651 --> 50:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's thoughts like these that
rob joy from
the very moments when joy is
most abundant.

50:24.955 --> 50:29.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here is how I'm trying to
approach such
thoughts these days.

50:29.059 --> 50:33.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm trying to remember that,
while I'm an
artist, I am many other things
as well.

50:33.097 --> 50:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a father and a partner, a
brother, son
and friend.

50:36.333 --> 50:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are all roles that I will
fill, even
if the bottom suddenly falls out
of my career.

50:41.038 --> 50:45.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think about my heroes, folks
like Leonard
Cohen and Neil Young and
Radiohead, who have

50:46.010 --> 50:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed their inspiration to
forbidding places,
making some of their finest,
most adventurous

50:49.947 --> 50:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work without reassurance of any
kind that
it would be appreciated or
understood.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Self-doubt is a very persistent
and difficult
feeling to overcome.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, I find it impossible to
write because
of it.

51:03.027 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nothing feels correct.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nothing feels new.

51:05.863 --> 51:08.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps I don't have anything to
say, so I
shouldn't say anything at all.

51:08.666 --> 51:13.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During this time, I try and
surround myself
with the unfamiliar, movies,
books and music

51:13.304 --> 51:15.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that I don't normally listen to.

51:15.105 --> 51:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In those moments, when I fear
that I'm losing
joy to mediocrity, self-delusion
and doubt,

51:20.911 --> 51:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm trying to open up my heart
to the future.

51:23.847 --> 51:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what will happen in
my life.

51:25.916 --> 51:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have no idea what will become
of the next
album, the next show, the next
song.

51:30.988 --> 51:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All I know is that with the
future comes the
chance for many great and
wonderful things

51:35.326 --> 51:36.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to happen.

51:36.327 --> 51:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is that future to which I
must turn.

51:39.229 --> 51:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard work, but I'm trying
hard.

As the Obama presidency comes to
an end, we
begin a series for the first two
weeks of

52:25.542 --> 52:30.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
January, "The Obama Years," a

his terms as president, the
accomplishments

52:30.981 --> 52:32.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the failures.

52:32.816 --> 52:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start on Monday, reviewing
his efforts
to preserve America's natural
lands and waters
