I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.808 --> 00:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: It's
the final
15 days.

00:11.945 --> 00:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump turns up the heat
in Florida,
while Hillary Clinton expands
her focus to

00:16.817 --> 00:18.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate races.

00:18.719 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: an update on one man's
life since we
met him four years ago as an
outspoken political

00:24.758 --> 00:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader in a crumbling Syrian
town.

00:26.894 --> 00:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALEH HAWA, Local Administrative
Council,
Haratan, Syria: We are being
butchered under

00:30.564 --> 00:34.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the eye of the international
community.

00:34.501 --> 00:41.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And two sets of
victory-starved
fans, the Chicago Cubs and the
Cleveland Indians,

00:41.675 --> 00:45.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get set to compete in a World
Series for the
ages.

00:45.679 --> 00:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.719 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.555 --> 01:05.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The finish line
draws closer,
and one presidential hopeful is
trying to

01:05.432 --> 01:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
catch up, while the other is
working to bring
friends along with her.

01:10.103 --> 01:13.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports on the
events of this
campaign day.

01:13.473 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump
right now is
focused on one word, Florida,
Florida, Florida.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: How are you feeling
about Florida,
Mr. Trump?

01:21.114 --> 01:22.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Very good.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Feel very good.

01:24.551 --> 01:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's in the
middle of a three-day,
five-rally swing through the
critical Sunshine

01:28.021 --> 01:31.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State, where early in-person
voting started
today.

01:31.992 --> 01:37.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He maintained that his outlook
is bright and
that polls showing him falling
behind are

01:37.464 --> 01:38.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flawed.

01:38.732 --> 01:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They are phony
polls put out
by phony media.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will tell you what.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All of us are affected by this
stuff.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what they do is they try and
suppress
the vote.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This way, people don't go out
and vote.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a
different story for
Hillary Clinton.

01:52.312 --> 01:57.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With increasingly strong polling
numbers,
she's pushing to win Democratic
control of

01:57.417 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it was a New Hampshire
rally push for
Senate candidate Maggie Hassan.

02:01.688 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That's why we need leaders like
Maggie.

02:05.292 --> 02:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unlike her opponent, she has
never been
afraid to stand up to Donald
Trump.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Over the this
weekend, Clinton
was aiming at races in
Pennsylvania.

02:13.533 --> 02:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I hope
you will do
everything you can to elect
Katie McGinty

02:18.205 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your next senator.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:20.207 --> 02:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And in North
Carolina.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I am
also hoping you're
going to send Deborah Ross to
the United States

02:24.644 --> 02:25.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:26.646 --> 02:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it's not
just Clinton.

02:30.317 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Running mate Tim Kaine joined in
from Florida
today, targeting incumbent
Republican Senator

02:35.188 --> 02:36.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Marco Rubio.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Let me just quote Marco Rubio.

02:39.626 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He called Donald Trump
dangerous, and he called
Donald Trump a con artist, but
he's supporting

02:44.865 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

02:46.633 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't get it, how you could
call somebody
a dangerous con artist and
support him.

02:50.570 --> 02:56.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, a
new story is
out related to the FBI's Clinton
e-mail investigation.

02:56.810 --> 03:02.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a Wall Street Journal
report centering
on Andrew McCabe, who became
deputy FBI director

03:02.449 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year, and as a result
gained an oversight
role in the e-mail probe.

03:07.587 --> 03:13.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story says his wife, Jill,
ran for Virginia
state Senate last year and
received campaign

03:13.460 --> 03:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funding thanks to Clinton ally
and Virginia
Governor Terry McAuliffe.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She lost her race.

03:19.866 --> 03:24.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Months later, her husband became
involved
with the Clinton investigation.

03:24.137 --> 03:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Journal reports that the FBI
didn't see
a conflict because McCabe's
wife's campaign

03:29.242 --> 03:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was over and there was no direct
connection
to Clinton.

03:32.813 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, it opened the door to
attacks from
team Trump, which said in a
statement today

03:38.385 --> 03:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the whole situation --
quote -- "shows
either negligent behavior by the
FBI or a

03:44.157 --> 03:46.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
level of corruption."

03:46.126 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two weeks to go, and it is both
a race to
get votes and to block votes
from the other

03:51.798 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

03:55.102 --> 03:59.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
Obama administration confirmed
that health

03:59.239 --> 04:04.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance premium costs will
jump next year
under the Affordable Care Act.

04:04.344 --> 04:10.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A mid-level plan will rise an
average of 25
percent in states served by the
federal online

04:10.617 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marketplace.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And 20 percent of consumers will
have just
one company to choose from.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sign-up starts November 1.

04:18.992 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AT&amp;T said today that it's
confident its deal
to buy the Time Warner media
empire will pass

04:25.499 --> 04:28.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
muster with Congress and federal
regulators.

04:28.101 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The telecom giant announced
plans on Saturday
to take over the parent of HBO,
CNN and the

04:35.075 --> 04:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Warner Bros. Studio for more
than $85 billion.

04:40.213 --> 04:45.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials in France today began
clearing the
makeshift migrant camp known as
the Jungle.

04:45.652 --> 04:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The operation in Calais means
moving some
6,500 people, many of them
trying to reach

04:51.992 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martin Geissler of Independent
Television
News reports.

04:55.996 --> 04:56.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: It's OK.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You can go.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's OK.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: With a friendly
word and
a hand on the shoulder, they
were ushered

05:02.702 --> 05:08.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
towards their buses, the
authorities doing
what they could to reassure
these people everything's

05:08.842 --> 05:10.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to be alright.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASCAL BRICE, OFPRA: We have
been talking
with them many times, convincing
them to stay

05:13.547 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in France, seek residence in
France, so they're
rather happy that we can do that
today.

05:18.451 --> 05:22.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: The exodus was
mostly orderly
and impressive in its scale.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At times, the authorities seemed
almost overwhelmed.

05:25.525 --> 05:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people queued in their
hundreds to be
processed, then dispatched to
centers right

05:30.564 --> 05:32.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across France.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were maps to explain where
they were
going, but no promises as to
what the future

05:36.703 --> 05:38.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might hold.

05:38.672 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This group of Afghan men told me
they will
stay in Northern France and keep
trying to

05:43.276 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cross the channel.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked Bakhram why he came
here.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He lifted his jacket and showed
me an appalling
abdominal wound.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A Taliban bomb did this, he
said.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever the future holds, it
can't be as
bad as his past.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Again, I will come back.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: You're going to
still come
back here?

06:01.728 --> 06:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes, I still come back.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: There was some
disorder here
last night.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The authorities are preparing
for more in
the hours ahead.

06:09.703 --> 06:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people of Calais want
Britain's help to
ensure this kind of crisis
doesn't arise again.

06:15.508 --> 06:20.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Work on
demolishing the camp
is to begin later this week.

06:20.247 --> 06:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, government forces
pushed into two
more villages today as their
offensive to

06:25.051 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retake the city of Mosul entered
its second
week.

06:28.421 --> 06:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special forces blasted away at
Islamic State
fighters, driving them out of
their positions.

06:34.261 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, Iraqi federal police
handed out
water and other aid to
civilians.

06:39.299 --> 06:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Syria, government troops
have captured
a key hilltop in the city of
Aleppo.

06:45.272 --> 06:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy fighting resumed there
after a cease-fire
expired over the weekend.

06:50.243 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Few rebels or civilians left the
city during
the lull.

06:54.547 --> 06:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word that greenhouse
gases passed
a grim milestone in 2015.

06:59.853 --> 07:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N.'s weather organization
says carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere
reached 400 parts

07:05.959 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
per million last year for the
first time on
record.

07:09.296 --> 07:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency says that's 44
percent more CO2
than before the Industrial
Revolution.

07:15.001 --> 07:18.271 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
PETTERI TAALAS,
Secretary-General, World
Meteorological
Organization: Its lifetime is
very long.

07:18.305 --> 07:25.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there have been some
scientific studies
estimating that the return back
to preindustrial

07:25.211 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
levels may take tens of
thousands of years.

07:29.015 --> 07:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. report
mainly blames
the burning of fossil fuels.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a powerful El Nino weather
pattern contributed
as well.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street got the week off to
a good start.

07:40.994 --> 07:46.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 77
points to close at 18223.

07:46.166 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 52, and the S&amp;P
500 added
10.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And two deaths of note tonight.

07:54.107 --> 07:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, Tom Hayden passed away
Sunday after
suffering a stroke last year.

07:58.878 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was a leader of the
anti-Vietnam War movement
who became a major name in
California politics.

08:06.553 --> 08:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Hayden's political activism
began in 1960
at the University of Michigan.

08:12.258 --> 08:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He helped form Students for a
Democratic Society,
or SDS, a leader of radical
opposition to

08:18.898 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Vietnam War.

08:22.135 --> 08:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1968, Hayden organized
anti-war protests
outside Chicago's tumultuous
Democratic National

08:29.576 --> 08:31.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Convention.

08:31.378 --> 08:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, he was convicted of
inciting riots
as one of the so-called Chicago
7, but the

08:37.117 --> 08:39.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
verdicts were later overturned.

08:39.252 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hayden stayed at the forefront
of the anti-war
movement, and, with actress Jane
Fonda, traveled

08:45.759 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to North Vietnam in 1972.

08:47.761 --> 08:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HAYDEN, Anti-War Activist:
They insisted
that there was no peace with
honor possible

08:52.799 --> 08:57.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the bombing of their
capital, that
it wasn't possible for them to
be bombed into

08:57.804 --> 09:03.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
any compromise of their
fundamental position
regarding what they define as
their national

09:03.176 --> 09:04.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

09:04.878 --> 09:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hayden and Fonda
were married
17 years, before divorcing in
1990.

09:10.150 --> 09:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along the way, he entered
California politics
and served as a state lawmaker
for nearly

09:15.355 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two decades.

09:17.056 --> 09:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also ran unsuccessfully for
governor of
California and then mayor of Los
Angeles.

09:23.196 --> 09:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In later years, Hayden was a
vocal opponent
of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tom Hayden died Sunday in Santa
Monica, California.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 76 years old.

09:35.775 --> 09:40.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bobby Vee passed away today
in Minneapolis
of advanced Alzheimer's.

09:40.680 --> 09:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pop singer gained notice at
the age of
15, filling in at a 1959 concert
after Buddy

09:47.454 --> 09:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Holly died in a plane crash.

09:49.689 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vee went on to record 38 top 100
hits in all,
including "Take Good Care of My
Baby" and

09:56.830 --> 09:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"The Night Has a Thousand Eyes."

09:59.466 --> 10:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bobby Vee was 73 years old.

10:01.868 --> 10:06.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the push
to register Latino voters ahead
of Election

10:06.739 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Day; rising tensions in the
protest to block
the Dakota oil pipeline; why a
Syrian activist

10:14.280 --> 10:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says the U.S. has let him down;
and much more.

10:27.460 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With just over two weeks until
Election Day,
we turn now to our Politics
Monday duo, Tamara

10:32.866 --> 10:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins us from Dallas.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fifteen days, but who's
counting?

10:39.739 --> 10:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: We are.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:42.308 --> 10:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We certainly are.

10:44.177 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Donald Trump today, Amy, is
out there
saying all the polls, which
mainly show Hillary

10:48.615 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton ahead, are phony.

10:50.550 --> 10:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's talking about phony media,
don't pay
any attention to it.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we to believe?

10:55.355 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it possible that most of
these polls are
wrong?

10:58.258 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
Judy, you can believe a lot of
things.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can also believe maybe that
a meteor is
going to come crashing to Earth
in the next

11:06.099 --> 11:07.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15 days.

11:07.901 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's hard to believe of the
31 polls that
we have seen over the last
month, all but

11:13.206 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three of them have shown Hillary
Clinton leading,
are all wrong.

11:16.776 --> 11:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the big major polling
operations
out there, CNN, ABC News, FOX,
all have Clinton

11:24.284 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead anywhere between five and
11 points.

11:26.886 --> 11:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I believe that the polls
have a margin
of error?

11:31.491 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Absolutely, but the reality is,
is that all
the polls, whether they are
national polls,

11:36.396 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether they are state polls,
are showing
an unmistakable pattern, and
that is a movement

11:40.300 --> 11:41.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Hillary Clinton.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's increased enthusiasm
from Democrats.

11:43.836 --> 11:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interestingly, we talked about
this last week,
Judy, but the attention that
Donald Trump

11:48.408 --> 11:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been giving on the trail
about vote rigging
and about the media and about
dishonesty may

11:55.582 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually be depressing his own
voters.

11:58.484 --> 12:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats, at least in the most
recent polls,
were seeming much more
enthusiastic about

12:02.822 --> 12:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporting Hillary Clinton, much
more enthusiastic
about coming out to vote.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, remember, early voting has
started in
a lot of these states.

12:09.495 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So many of these states, more
than half of
their votes come through early
voting.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, you're
talking to
people in the campaigns all the
time.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any
undercurrent of
suspicion out there that maybe
there is something

12:21.708 --> 12:23.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wrong with the polls this year?

12:23.476 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, there is
suspicion coming
from the Trump campaign, but
there is not

12:28.481 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspicion coming from the
Clinton campaign.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their internal polls, from what
they have
told us from time to time, have
matched the

12:35.021 --> 12:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public polls or showed them
actually in a
better position than the public
polls.

12:38.891 --> 12:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they do their polling
differently, their
internal polling differently.

12:42.562 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They match it up with voters
files, and they
feel very confident about where
they stand.

12:47.333 --> 12:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has actually today pointed
to an e-mail
released by WikiLeaks, a John
Podesta e-mail,

12:53.272 --> 12:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that they're oversampling
certain voters.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was an e-mail from 2008.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump wasn't running for
president
in 2008.

13:02.015 --> 13:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, this is a case of a
candidate who
has built his campaign on
winning, and now

13:09.555 --> 13:16.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he's trying to deal with
evidence on the ground
that indicates that, at this
moment and probably

13:16.129 --> 13:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going forward, winning is not
something that
is apparent in any of the public
polls really.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, you have
been looking
at polls for a number of
elections.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been doing this for a
while.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how far ahead is Hillary
Clinton?

13:30.143 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can she count on at this
point, or if
anything?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, Judy, thanks
for that.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I'm very old.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:37.850 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I have been doing
this for a long
time.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not around as
long as some
of us.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's put it that way.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:44.657 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: If you look at --
what I like
to do is to look at an average
of polls, rather

13:47.326 --> 13:50.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
than taking one poll and
spending too much
time on that.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a number of these Web sites
now aggregate
polls.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They put their own trend lines
together.

13:55.501 --> 14:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they're showing is
Hillary Clinton
up anywhere between five and six
points nationally.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to translate
differently in different
states.

14:03.710 --> 14:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just to give you an idea of
what five
or six points looks like at the
Electoral

14:08.548 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
College level, remember, Barack
Obama won
by about four points in 2012,
easily carried

14:13.553 --> 14:15.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Electoral College.

14:15.088 --> 14:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He won by more than 10 million
votes in 2008,
by about six, seven points.

14:20.793 --> 14:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had 323 electoral votes --
I'm sorry -- 365
electoral votes in 2008.

14:28.534 --> 14:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So a six-point national average
translates
to a pretty big electoral
margin, maybe not

14:35.508 --> 14:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as big as Barack Obama's in
2008.

14:38.745 --> 14:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one challenge that Hillary
Clinton has
is, she's still struggling in a
place -- in

14:42.815 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two places that Obama carried,
Iowa and Ohio.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she's obviously doing better
in Arizona
and Georgia.

14:49.021 --> 14:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, what we
do see is
that the Clinton camp, Hillary
Clinton, is

14:52.825 --> 14:54.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expanding the focus.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, they're campaigning for
her, but she's
talking about these Senate
candidates.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard that in Lisa's piece a
few minutes
ago.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How comfortable do they feel
spending time
and resources on that?

15:05.505 --> 15:10.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Clearly -- and
also the super
PAC that is allied with Hillary
Clinton is

15:10.610 --> 15:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also shifting its resources,
shifting some
of its focus to the Senate.

15:14.380 --> 15:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Clinton campaign at this
point is
very confident that they can get
to 270 electoral

15:19.418 --> 15:21.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
votes.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are now running a
campaign that is
very much also about --
conveniently, many

15:25.925 --> 15:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the competitive Senate races
also happen
to be in the swing states.

15:29.061 --> 15:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they are running a campaign
that is about
trying to make sure that she has
a Democratic

15:33.032 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate to work with for things
like Supreme
Court nominees and other
nominees.

15:37.970 --> 15:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, initially, her campaign
focus, they treated
Donald Trump as an outlier.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said, you know, he's not a
Republican.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were trying to win over
moderate Republicans.

15:48.981 --> 15:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they're saying, all of these
Republican
Senate candidates, they stuck by
him, they

15:53.686 --> 15:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enabled him, they didn't disavow
him enough.

15:56.455 --> 16:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're trying to sort of
hang Donald
Trump on them, even though --
even though

16:02.161 --> 16:03.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- yes.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
what you mean.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:06.966 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know what you
mean.

16:08.301 --> 16:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Tam, there's one other
thing I do want
to ask you about.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been
reporting lately
on this growing sense out there
on the campaign

16:14.307 --> 16:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail or commentary that is --
and the treatment
of women, attitudes toward
women.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you wrote about it just the
other day.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

16:24.417 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, basically, that story says
it was inevitable
that sexism would have a
presence in a campaign

16:29.121 --> 16:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a woman running to be
president of the
United States, be the first
female president

16:33.693 --> 16:35.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

16:35.528 --> 16:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was inevitable with Hillary
Clinton that
-- especially -- that there's
been negativity

16:40.199 --> 16:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about her coming from the
Republican side
for as long as she's been in the
public eye.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's a disruptive figure.

16:46.806 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what wasn't inevitable is
that her opponent
would actively cede and fuel
that sexism with

16:52.478 --> 16:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things like the woman card.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I talk to
Republican political
operatives who say, if this were
a different

16:59.085 --> 17:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate, it probably wouldn't
have been
this overt.

17:01.687 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It certainly wouldn't have been
coming from
the lectern of the person that
was running

17:06.125 --> 17:08.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

17:08.227 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they believe that that is
going to contribute
to what is likely the largest
gender gap in

17:13.766 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
history, with women
overwhelmingly favoring
Hillary Clinton.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that nasty woman comment
became sort of
a crystallizing moment for a lot
of voters.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very quickly,
Amy, that's
what a lot of people are looking
at, isn't

17:23.509 --> 17:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, the gap, the gender gap.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The gender gap, and,
again, one
piece, of course, being Hillary
Clinton, who

17:29.248 --> 17:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she is, and the other, of
course, Donald Trump
and the comments he's made
throughout the

17:33.252 --> 17:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign and the judgments that
he's made.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's going to be a big
piece of this.

17:38.090 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Amy
Walter, who's
only been covering politics for
a very short

17:42.194 --> 17:43.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time, thank you.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:44.263 --> 17:45.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Very short.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Tamara Keith.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Politics Monday, thank you both.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we have
heard, reliably
red Arizona is one of the latest
states that

17:53.673 --> 17:56.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is feeling the effects of a
Democratic push.

17:56.809 --> 18:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last week, Michelle Obama
visited Phoenix,
and polls show the presidential
race tightening.

18:02.748 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hoping to boost voter turnout, a
group called
Arizona One is making sure
Latinos who are

18:07.787 --> 18:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eligible actually register and
vote.

18:10.556 --> 18:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the recent state deadline,
Arizona One
helped register 150,000 Latino
voters.

18:16.162 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story comes from University
of California,
Berkeley, journalism students.

18:20.833 --> 18:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's produced by Angelica Casas
and Jennifer
Cain, who narrates.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: Abril Gallardo is
working overtime.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABRIL GALLARDO, One Arizona: We
can start
off and do some role play.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Abril.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nice to meet you.

18:34.747 --> 18:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: The college
student is a part
of a coalition called One
Arizona.

18:38.150 --> 18:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group's effort, to register
new Latino
voters, could alter the
political makeup of

18:43.255 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABRIL GALLARDO: We are going to
get you registered
to vote.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you a U.S. citizen?

18:49.261 --> 18:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: Roughly, 400,000
Latinos are
eligible to vote, but are
unregistered.

18:52.231 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One Arizona registered 150,000
Latino voters
this year.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Latinos tend to vote Democrat.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their efforts could swing the
state blue for
the first time in decades.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABRIL GALLARDO: You're not old
enough?

19:05.878 --> 19:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will you be 18 before November?

19:09.348 --> 19:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to make a change in my
community.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to impact my community.

19:12.618 --> 19:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: Some of the
canvassers can't
vote themselves, like Abril.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For over a decade, she was
undocumented.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now she calls herself
DACAmented.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DACA is Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals.

19:25.831 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It provides temporary legal
status to individuals
who arrived in the U.S. before
2007 and were

19:31.570 --> 19:33.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under the age of 16.

19:33.406 --> 19:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABRIL GALLARDO: I have my own
voice, and,
as undocumented and not being
able to vote,

19:38.944 --> 19:44.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my power, my political power is
as strong
as if I could vote.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: In 2010, Arizona
passed state
Bill 1070.

19:47.686 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The law required immigrants over
the age of
14 to carry documentation of
legal status

19:53.192 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at all times.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many families felt targeted by
the law and
formed One Arizona.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEJANDRA GOMEZ, Executive
Director, Arizona
Center for Empowerment: So we
would have the

19:59.999 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vigil on this side, and then, on
this side,
we would have all of the voter
registration

20:05.504 --> 20:07.273 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tables.

20:07.306 --> 20:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: At the time
SB-1070 passed,
Alejandra Gomez was in college
and her father

20:11.177 --> 20:12.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was undocumented.

20:12.711 --> 20:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEJANDRA GOMEZ: We have been
going out to
every single supermarket, mall.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been going out to gas
stations.

20:22.621 --> 20:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's this whole group of young
people that
care about what happens to their
parents,

20:28.227 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that care about their future,
that care about
their education.

20:30.930 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: Many of the
group's canvassers
come from predominantly Latino
neighborhoods

20:35.401 --> 20:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Phoenix, Tucson and Yuma,
where One Arizona
focuses its efforts.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE OSORIA, One Arizona:
There's many people
out there that can't vote, but
they wish they

20:43.909 --> 20:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could vote, because they know
how much this
affects them.

20:46.979 --> 20:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: Jose Osoria, an
18-year-old
canvasser, is one of those
people who wish

20:51.150 --> 20:52.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they could vote.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Born in Sonora, he immigrated 10
years ago.

20:55.821 --> 20:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he works full time on voter
education
and voter protection.

20:59.125 --> 21:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE OSORIA: A lot of people
don't know where
to go to get registered.

21:04.063 --> 21:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The majority would be Hispanic
families that
are citizens and are able to
vote, but don't

21:10.870 --> 21:12.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know the whole thing.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I take my time.

21:16.008 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
need the whole
community, right?

21:21.981 --> 21:25.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSE OSORIA (through
translator): That's true.

21:25.651 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): This
is the first
time I will be voting.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just became a citizen.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSE OSORIA (through
translator): Thank you.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going out there and teaching
people like
me.

21:35.561 --> 21:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: While efforts to
register Latinos
have helped increase their rolls
to more than

21:40.633 --> 21:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
600,000, not all will go to the
polls.

21:43.335 --> 21:48.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEJANDRA GOMEZ: The
undocumented community
that can't vote are the ones
that have been

21:48.107 --> 21:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading these efforts and saying
that, even
though I can't vote, you can be
my voice and

21:54.079 --> 21:55.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you can be my vote.

21:55.881 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE OSORIA: When I register
someone, I'm
always doing it with a smile,
because they're

21:59.285 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contagious.

22:00.286 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Voting?

22:01.287 --> 22:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I not receive my registration.

22:03.122 --> 22:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: As Election Day
approaches,
One Arizona will knock on the
doors of 105,000

22:08.327 --> 22:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homes, urging people to get to
the polls and
vote early.

22:12.431 --> 22:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE OSORIA: Then you should
re-register,
because you weren't registered.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, sign here and date it.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Today is the 23rd.

22:19.171 --> 22:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Jennifer Cain reporting in
Phoenix, Arizona.

22:23.108 --> 22:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSE OSORIA: Thank you so much.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Have a good day.

22:31.951 --> 22:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
the escalating
fight over a major oil pipeline
in North Dakota.

22:39.091 --> 22:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, more than 120
protesters were
arrested, part of a months-long
campaign being

22:44.630 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
waged by numerous Native
American tribes and
nations against the Dakota
Access oil pipeline.

22:51.003 --> 22:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the latest, I'm joined by
our William
Brangham, who reported from
North Dakota last

22:55.841 --> 22:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month and has been following the
story closely.

22:58.811 --> 23:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William, bring us up to date,
but, first,
remind us, what is this fight
all about?

23:03.849 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the arguments on each
side?

23:05.651 --> 23:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The fight, as
you mentioned,
is about this pipeline.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the Dakota Access pipeline.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a 1,200-mile pipeline to
bring oil from
North Dakota, the Bakken oil
fields, down

23:15.027 --> 23:16.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Illinois.

23:16.795 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the point of contention here
is right
at the border of the North
Dakota-South Dakota

23:20.299 --> 23:21.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state line.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where the Standing
Rock Tribe has
a reservation.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And their primary source of
drinking water
is the Missouri River.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This pipeline is going to go
right under the
river just north of their
reservation.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they say two things.

23:33.679 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, if that pipeline leaks,
it's going to
contaminate their only source of
drinking

23:37.149 --> 23:39.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

23:39.051 --> 23:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, two, the construction
process will desecrate
burial grounds and ancestral
sites just north

23:44.590 --> 23:46.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their reservation.

23:46.191 --> 23:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's their argument.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want the pipeline
there because
of that reason.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The company
that is building
this, Energy Transfer Partners,
argues they

23:53.399 --> 23:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done all the legal permits
and applications
and they have done all the bits
that they're

23:58.037 --> 23:59.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supposed to do.

23:59.872 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also argue that this
pipeline is a far
safer way of transporting oil
than trains

24:04.977 --> 24:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or trucks, which are much more
prone to crash.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is data that backs
that assertion
up.

24:09.715 --> 24:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also argue that we live in
a carbon-based
society.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We drove to work today.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are going to drive to
work tomorrow.

24:15.454 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until we figure a different
way of moving
oil or find a different way to
power our houses

24:19.391 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cars, we have to deal with
this material
and they argue the pipeline is
the way to

24:23.896 --> 24:25.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does
the actual construction
stand right now of the pipeline?

24:28.334 --> 24:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The energy
company says
that the pipeline is about 60
percent built.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you can imagine the pipeline
is moving
in from the north and the south.

24:35.407 --> 24:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's -- the real holdup at
this point
right near the Standing Rock
reservation.

24:40.412 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where most of the
protests and
arrests that we have seen have
been happening,

24:44.316 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where members of different
Native tribes,
primarily Standing Rock, go out
to these places

24:48.987 --> 24:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the construction is still
going on and
they chain themselves to the
trucks.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The police come arrest them.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where the conflict
has been happening.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the pipeline is largely
done.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where really the
fight is going
on right now.

25:00.866 --> 25:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we know there
is still
a couple of restrictions that
have to be lifted

25:05.504 --> 25:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before they can go ahead and
finish with the
construction, but once that
happens, what

25:10.042 --> 25:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do people expect will take
place?

25:12.044 --> 25:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, that's
really -- that's
a very dodgy question.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People don't exactly know what's
going to
happen.

25:17.516 --> 25:24.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Army Corps agrees to this
last permit
and says to the company, go
ahead and finish,

25:24.356 --> 25:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drill into the river, the
question is, what
will all these protesters do?

25:27.693 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw thousands of people out
there.

25:30.396 --> 25:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear if they will
voluntarily get
up and leave.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear if there will be
a fight.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who is going to evict them?

25:36.802 --> 25:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The jails out there are already
so full, they
have to bus people they arrest
outside of

25:40.606 --> 25:42.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will the National Guard be
involved?

25:43.742 --> 25:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will this very militarized
police force step
in?

25:47.246 --> 25:48.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody really knows.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, William, you
and I were
talking earlier.

25:50.416 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were saying how unusual it
is that you
have, what, over 100 different
Native American

25:55.454 --> 26:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tribes that have come together
to make up
this protest.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why over this particular issue?

26:02.294 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's really
the most fascinating
part of all this, because there
have been

26:05.297 --> 26:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plenty of instances in the past
where you
could have seen tribes coalesce
around an

26:10.436 --> 26:11.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think social media had a lot
to do with
this.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been -- the tribe, the
Standing
Rock, has been very, very good
at getting

26:16.575 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their message out.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time there's an arrest,
every time there's
a protest, every time there's
something they

26:21.213 --> 26:24.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
want to promote, it's on
Facebook, it's on
Twitter, it's on social media.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So that's brought people
together.

26:26.051 --> 26:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, also, that this wasn't
a fait accompli.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't a done deal.

26:31.056 --> 26:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when they put out the
call and said,
come help us, people felt like
they could

26:35.761 --> 26:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stand in the way of this.

26:37.596 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for whatever reason, people
from all over
the country, really all over the
world, came

26:41.600 --> 26:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together and said, enough is
enough.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I know you
are going to
continue to watch it.

26:46.004 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very much an active scene
right now.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The protest goes on.

26:51.910 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham, thank you.

27:01.820 --> 27:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
and Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
spoke today

27:05.691 --> 27:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by phone about the situation in
the besieged
Syrian city of Aleppo.

27:10.729 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After a brief letup, the heavy
fighting and
bombing has resumed there.

27:14.867 --> 27:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four years ago, Margaret Warner
traveled throughout
that part of Northwest Syria.

27:19.538 --> 27:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has been back in touch with
a man she
first met just outside Aleppo.

27:24.142 --> 27:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was November
2012 in a
small town in Syria, and Saleh
Hawa had hopes.

27:32.584 --> 27:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With civil war roiling around
him, this father
of three, an English literature
teacher, was

27:38.724 --> 27:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading demonstrations against
the regime
of Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.

27:46.064 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hawa also headed a local civic
council in
his town in rebel-controlled
Northwest Syria.

27:51.737 --> 27:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was working to restore
electricity and
basic services destroyed by
government attacks.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sounded fairly confident then
in his country's
prospects.

28:00.979 --> 28:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A formal Syrian opposition
coalition had just
been created, with the
encouragement of Western

28:07.119 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Gulf countries.

28:08.820 --> 28:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALEH HAWA, Local Administrative
Council,
Haratan, Syria: I am optimistic,
because the

28:12.891 --> 28:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international community is now
cooperating
with this council, with this new
council.

28:19.031 --> 28:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, personally, that
most of the
Syrian people are with this
council.

28:28.340 --> 28:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are looking forward to a
better future,
and we are tired now.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are tired now of war.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are tired of shelling every
day.

28:40.118 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: We spoke in a
walled garden
in Hawa's hometown of Haratan,
just northwest

28:45.190 --> 28:46.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Aleppo.

28:47.025 --> 28:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We then traveled to the regional
headquarters
of the Free Syrian Army, made up
of self-declared

28:51.563 --> 28:53.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderate rebels.

28:53.365 --> 28:58.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its Commander, Colonel
Abdul-Jabbar Akidi,
told us bluntly how desperately
they needed

28:58.236 --> 28:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weapons from the United States.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL-JABBAR AKIDI, Aleppo
Region Military
Council (through translator):
The Syrian people

29:03.375 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will not forget any country that
provides
them with support, and will not
forgive any

29:07.613 --> 29:09.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country that helps the Assad
regime.

29:09.381 --> 29:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But in the four
years since
then, none of Hawa's hopes, but
all of his

29:14.820 --> 29:17.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fears, have been realized.

29:17.522 --> 29:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haratan has been repeatedly
pounded by bombing
from Russian and Syrian jets,
dropping not

29:24.429 --> 29:30.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only explosive-packed barrel
bombs, but cluster
bombs and the fearsome
incendiary white phosphorous.

29:30.902 --> 29:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we first met Hawa, the war
had killed
37,000 people.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it's 500,000 dead and nine
million displaced.

29:40.712 --> 29:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aleppo and the area around it
has become ground
zero.

29:44.783 --> 29:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the Russian military
announced
a short-lived cease-fire, a
pause to let humanitarian

29:50.222 --> 29:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aid into and around Aleppo,
including Hawa's
hometown.

29:54.059 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Hawa, whom we reconnected
with via Skype,
says there are few lives left to
save in his

30:00.399 --> 30:02.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
town.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALEH HAWA: Most of the
population of Haratan
left the town, because there is
no single

30:04.136 --> 30:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
house which is safe right now.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Most of the houses were
completely or partially
destroyed.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they cannot be lived in
again.

30:09.274 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, most of the families left
the city, because
right now there is no
electricity, no water,

30:21.119 --> 30:24.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
no food.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Even the bakery was targeted.

30:28.026 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All hospitals, all medical
centers were targeted.

30:32.631 --> 30:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Hawa and wife
and children
fled Haratan to a nearby town.

30:38.270 --> 30:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all safe, he said, but
he's lost many
friends, and himself was the
target of a car

30:43.108 --> 30:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bomb attack in early 2014.

30:46.178 --> 30:51.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and others are still teaching
at a makeshift
college they call the Free
University of Aleppo,

30:51.983 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he sounds full of despair
and bitterness.

30:54.619 --> 31:01.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALEH HAWA: We are being
butchered under the
eye of the international
community.

31:01.226 --> 31:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It's not just
the bombing,
he said.

31:03.729 --> 31:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His town's defenders, already
fighting ISIS
and the Syrian government, then
were confronted

31:08.633 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with other foes.

31:10.168 --> 31:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They'd come from afar to defend
the Assad
regime.

31:14.740 --> 31:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALEH HAWA: We came face to face
with the
Shiite militias.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are mostly Afghani,
Afghanistani.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of them are Iranian, and so
on.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, Afghanis
sponsored by
Iran and trained by Iran?

31:31.823 --> 31:33.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SALEH HAWA: Yes, sure.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Are they
well-equipped?

31:36.361 --> 31:38.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SALEH HAWA: They're
well-equipped.

31:38.396 --> 31:42.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Caught between
all these
competing forces, Hawa says he
and his countrymen

31:42.968 --> 31:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been abandoned, even as
endless talks
go on between the U.S. and
Russians and at

31:48.406 --> 31:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times members of the Syrian
opposition coalition.

31:51.543 --> 31:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, can you foresee a political
solution at
this point?

31:56.214 --> 32:00.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SALEH HAWA: No.

32:00.652 --> 32:09.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm so sorry to say no.

32:09.628 --> 32:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see that the horizon is quite
blocked in
front of us, because America is
not doing

32:21.573 --> 32:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything, or maybe -- or maybe
America won't
do anything.

32:25.343 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just that America hasn't
have the will
to finish our agony, finish our
pains, to

32:31.983 --> 32:32.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finish or sufferings.

32:32.984 --> 32:33.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were let down.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America let us down.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the situation now is that
Russia has got
military bases inside Syria.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their warplanes are flying in
the sky every
time they like.

32:38.557 --> 32:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Videos of the
Syrian people's
suffering have spread worldwide,
but Hawa

32:42.694 --> 32:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has no faith that the world will
respond.

32:46.131 --> 32:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking to us now, thousands of
miles away,
he recalled the expectations he
had when we

32:51.203 --> 32:53.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
met four years ago.

32:53.038 --> 33:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALEH HAWA: I hoped, at that
time, that America
would, in a way, help us to put
an end to

33:02.881 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that dictator who is now in
Damascus.

33:07.319 --> 33:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a hope that there are
countries who
would help us rebuild our
country and help

33:12.657 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those innocent people.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we don't trust anybody.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't trust any country.

33:16.661 --> 33:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had many promises that
they will not
allow Bashar al-Assad to destroy
our cities.

33:21.333 --> 33:27.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, you see that the
situation
is deteriorating even worse than
before.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's becoming worse.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's becoming worse and worse
day by day.

33:32.344 --> 33:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And with each
day, new casualties
and faded hopes of a lasting
peace.

33:37.849 --> 33:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner
in Washington.

33:43.188 --> 33:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we have been
reporting,
the tone and rhetoric of this
presidential

33:57.035 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race are markedly different from
previous
years and have only intensified
with two weeks

34:02.073 --> 34:04.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go to Election Day.

34:04.109 --> 34:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of the latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is in charge.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Had enough of
debates, ads,
speeches?

34:12.117 --> 34:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new book argues that -- quote
-- "The crisis
in our politics is a crisis of
political language,"

34:17.856 --> 34:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as it explores the arts and
science of rhetoric
through the ages.

34:21.159 --> 34:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called "Enough Said: What's
Gone Wrong
With the Language of Politics?"

34:25.263 --> 34:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Mark Thompson is viewing
all this from
a very influential perch, as
president and

34:29.534 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CEO of The New York Times
Company.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON, Author, "Enough
Said: What's
Gone Wrong With the Language of
Politics?":

34:34.105 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hi there.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The problem is
our language
or our politics.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're making the case that it's
one and the
same.

34:39.878 --> 34:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: We have been
brought up, many
of us, to think that the
political language

34:43.782 --> 34:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is like a superficial layer, and
below that
is ideology and policy.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My argument is, it's all tangled
up.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Particular ideas are expressed
in language.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're argued about in
language.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're communicated from one
human being
to another in language.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And political language is
everywhere.

34:59.297 --> 35:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's because of changes I
saw in political
language that I decided to write
this book.

35:03.335 --> 35:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And so let me try
to look at
now and we will put it in some
context.

35:07.238 --> 35:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to do a broad brush
here and say
that, in Hillary Clinton, I
think many people

35:12.911 --> 35:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a kind of political rhetoric
that comes
off as phony.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that fair?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: I think it is.

35:19.951 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is almost the epitome of a
certain kind
of modern, technocratic, very
rational, very

35:26.491 --> 35:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carefully argued political
language which
many people find convincing, but
a growing

35:31.663 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of people, in many
Western countries,
are finding that kind of
political language

35:36.634 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
distant, alienating and
unfeeling, and maybe
even not believable.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not believable.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, well, it leads us to Donald
Trump, right?

35:45.910 --> 35:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: When you get a
breakdown in
the conventions of political
rhetoric, and

35:51.850 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you get a large number of
people who
are looking for something
different, it opens

35:56.955 --> 36:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up a vacuum into which populists
can come.

36:00.191 --> 36:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is very fertile ground
for a populist
who wants to say something much
simpler, which

36:05.797 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is, I speak like you.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm an ordinary person like you.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I call it authenticism.

36:10.602 --> 36:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By an authenticist, I mean a
politician who
very deliberately and
consciously aims to

36:16.808 --> 36:18.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appear authentic.

36:18.610 --> 36:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The media is part
of your book,
part of this political culture,
of course,

36:23.314 --> 36:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the worsening of our
political culture?

36:25.750 --> 36:26.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK THOMPSON: Yes.

36:26.751 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the media has gone through
great changes.

36:29.621 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's come under,
particularly of the digital
revolution, colossal competitive
pressure.

36:34.259 --> 36:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's reduced thinking time,
because the
new cycle is continuous now.

36:38.696 --> 36:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The urge to go for the bolder
quotes, the
more -- the strongest possible
version of

36:45.236 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the story means that, very much
like the politicians,
the risk is, you get into a bias
around exaggeration

36:51.643 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and of high drama.

36:53.545 --> 37:00.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, instead of calm,
dispassionate discussion,
you tend to get these very
abrupt, you know,

37:00.452 --> 37:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and dramatic developments in the
story.

37:02.320 --> 37:08.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The institution
you represent
in particular, though, is not
just any player.

37:08.293 --> 37:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a major player in all of
this, becomes
part of the news itself.

37:12.497 --> 37:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK THOMPSON: The two
institutions I have
been most involved with, The New
York Times

37:15.934 --> 37:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the BBC, because I think
they try incredibly
hard not to get swept away by
these trends

37:22.974 --> 37:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to try and still report
things dispassionately
and fairly.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But to the extent
that The
Times is a target for those who
see it as

37:30.882 --> 37:38.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wielding its power for a
particular bias,
is that a dangerous place for a
media institution

37:38.356 --> 37:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be, or where you want to be?

37:40.425 --> 37:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: No, I think if
you believe
in the First Amendment for
journalists and

37:43.728 --> 37:48.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for newspapers and TV companies,
you have
got to believe in it for their
critics as

37:48.066 --> 37:49.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

37:49.934 --> 37:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone's got a right to raise
any criticism
they want about our journalism,
and we should

37:53.171 --> 37:55.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take that seriously.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you don't have the right to
do is to
try and threaten people into
silence.

37:58.443 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we very recently have been
in receipt
of a letter threatening a libel
action from

38:04.048 --> 38:05.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump's lawyers.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: We responded
firstly making
the point that there was nothing
about Donald

38:09.020 --> 38:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's reputation which he
hadn't already,
frankly, built himself before we
printed the

38:14.192 --> 38:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testimony of a couple of the
women who said
they had been abused by him,
and, secondly,

38:19.197 --> 38:23.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reminding Mr. Trump's lawyers
about the First
Amendment and our right to cover
matters of

38:23.334 --> 38:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
genuine public importance.

38:25.069 --> 38:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How do you, on
the one hand,
call for a less combative stance
from the

38:30.041 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
media, a more sort of
analytical, explain
to people, while at the same
time being in

38:36.881 --> 38:38.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
combat?

38:38.249 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: I think politics
probably has
always been combat.

38:40.585 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The issue is whether or not
there are sensible
rules of engagement.

38:45.623 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I allow you to make your case
and keep
quiet and don't interrupt you,
and then you

38:50.828 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let me make my case, we can let
the people
who hear us decide who's got the
better case.

38:56.334 --> 39:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're talking over each other
and arguing
and complaining, it begins to
jumble the discourse,

39:02.006 --> 39:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rather vicious world of the
anonymous
Web.

39:05.143 --> 39:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's reinfected straightforward
political
oratory, so that the things that
politicians

39:10.014 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say about each other, the
abandonment of any
presumption of good faith, the
calling of

39:15.820 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other politicians liars, they
should be in
jail and so forth, this doesn't
really help

39:21.392 --> 39:22.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

39:22.393 --> 39:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think the public like
it.

39:23.494 --> 39:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What would it
take to change
it?

39:25.063 --> 39:27.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: You can read
history very pessimistically
or optimistically.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where are you
today?

39:29.400 --> 39:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: Well, I want to
be optimistic.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the stakes for us are
very high.

39:35.306 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say, right now,
freedom of speech,
clarity of political discourse,
simply the

39:41.813 --> 39:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tone and the credibility of the
political
process is under grave
challenge, crucially

39:48.419 --> 39:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just in the U.S., but in my
country in
the U.K. and I would say in
pretty much every

39:53.157 --> 39:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country in the Western world.

39:54.492 --> 39:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Enough
Said."

39:56.394 --> 39:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Thompson, thank you very
much.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK THOMPSON: Thank you.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After all of
these years, it's
hard to believe this next
sentence, but fans

40:01.032 --> 40:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know it's true: The Chicago Cubs
will face
off against the Cleveland
Indians starting

40:01.866 --> 40:03.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomorrow night in the World
Series.

40:03.801 --> 40:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Life is about to change in one
of these cities,
whose fans have long suffered
and waited decades

40:04.469 --> 40:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a baseball championship.

40:05.970 --> 40:06.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang, who has Chicago and
Cleveland roots
of his own, is our guide.

40:06.771 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The Cubs have won the
pennant!

40:08.006 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's a call that
hasn't been made
in 71 years.

40:09.807 --> 40:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chicago Cubs and their
long-suffering
fans are finally going back to
World Series.

40:10.908 --> 40:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Oh, my gosh, I was crying
the whole
game.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm out of tears.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's unbelievable.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, all you think is, are they
really going
to do it and am I going to be
there?

40:14.145 --> 40:14.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we were.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were here to watch them win.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cubs fans have seen
their share
of heartbreak, including losing
101 games

40:17.148 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just four years ago.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last time the Cubs actually
won the World
Series, 1908.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The last time they won a
pennant, a local
tavern owner and his goat were
kicked out

40:21.085 --> 40:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of World Series game four at
Wrigley Field.

40:22.787 --> 40:23.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since, the curse of the
billy goat, and
some notorious blunders on field
and off,

40:23.755 --> 40:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have kept them on the outside
looking in.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Cubs aren't the only
team hoping to
end a World Series drought this
year.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're set to face the
Cleveland Indians,
who haven't won the fall classic
since 1948.

40:29.027 --> 40:29.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have made it three times
since, but lost
each time, most recently in 1995
and 1997.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Just amazing.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're doing great, and I know
they're going
to bring that World Series home.

40:32.897 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Game one is set for
Tuesday in
Cleveland, and the excitement in
both cities

40:33.331 --> 40:34.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is running high.

40:35.033 --> 40:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to tracking site
TicketIQ, standing
room for Tuesday's start at
$860.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And for Friday's game in
Chicago, $2,000.

40:37.735 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More on this moment, the history
and the mood
from a pair of sports reporters
covering these

40:38.036 --> 40:39.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teams.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Al Pawlowski is host of "Indians
Live," the
Cleveland pre- and post-game
shows on Fox

40:40.204 --> 40:41.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SportsTime Ohio.

40:41.706 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Rick Telander is the senior
sports columnist
for The Chicago Sun-Times.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Al, Rick, thanks a lot for
joining us.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rick, let me start with you.

40:45.076 --> 40:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your column this morning, you
said it's still
hard to conceive of the Cubs in
the World

40:45.743 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Series after 71 years away.

40:47.578 --> 40:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were there ever moments you
doubted this or
you questioned Saturday night
that this was

40:48.212 --> 40:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually going to happen?

40:49.414 --> 40:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK TELANDER, The Chicago
Sun-Times: Oh,
absolutely.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You doubt everything all the
way.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, 71 years ago, I wasn't
even born.

40:52.950 --> 40:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so everybody -- you heard in
the setup
piece the young women speaking,
people weeping

40:58.956 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
openly when the Cubs won that
game.

41:01.259 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they got to five outs
-- you know,
five outs is that critical
amount that they

41:05.797 --> 41:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missed in 2003, the notorious
game where Moises
Alou slapped his glove on his
leg because

41:12.036 --> 41:14.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he missed a foul ball because
fan were reaching
for it.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's always been doubt.

41:16.541 --> 41:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's hard even now I think
in Chicago
for people to believe this,
because they -- they

41:21.679 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't anybody alive -- there is
no one alive
who've seen the Cubs win the
World Series,

41:25.550 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there's very few people
alive who saw
them even get into a World
Series.

41:30.188 --> 41:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Al, so much attention
is being
given to the Ind -- to the --
I'm sorry -- to

41:34.158 --> 41:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cubs and about their sort of
reputation as
lovable losers.

41:38.896 --> 41:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's a lot of history
with the Indians
too over the years.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does this mean to
Cleveland?

41:45.069 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL PAWLOWSKI, Fox SportsTime
Ohio: Well, it
goes back to so many
generations, similar

41:48.272 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Chicago.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cubs have been around there
forever, and
same thing here with the
Indians.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They played professional
baseball here since
the late 1800s.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Indians have been around
since 1901.

41:58.383 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, something that the Indians
bring even
more than the Cavaliers that won
the championship

42:03.054 --> 42:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this summer -- and it was
Cleveland's first
major sports championship since
1964 -- baseball

42:08.960 --> 42:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Indians kind of connect
the generations.

42:10.862 --> 42:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember my grandparents
talking about Larry
Doby and Lou Boudreau and some
of those guys,

42:16.367 --> 42:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and my parents talking about
what they saw
when they were kids in the '54
World Series.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there hasn't been a winner
since '48.

42:22.974 --> 42:24.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never seen this team win
a World Series.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen them in it for a
couple of years
in the '90s.

42:27.979 --> 42:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's kind of what this
baseball team
brings to this community.

42:31.949 --> 42:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a sports team that really
connects the
generations over time.

42:35.486 --> 42:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Over the weekend,
Bernie Lincicome,
who writes for The Chicago
Tribune, and grew

42:39.457 --> 42:45.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up an Indians fan, your
cross-river rival
there, Rick, he said: "This
series matchup

42:45.997 --> 42:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invites the question of who has
suffered more,
as if pain decides who is more
deserving,

42:51.836 --> 42:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as if agony is a critical
benefit."

42:54.906 --> 42:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rick, talk about some of that
pain over the
years.

42:57.508 --> 43:03.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned the five-out
championship a
few years back.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But talk about some of that pain
over the
years for Cubs fans.

43:06.284 --> 43:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK TELANDER: Well, it's very
similar to
Cleveland.

43:09.821 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only, I think it's more extreme
because it
goes back farther.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People in Chicago don't hate the
city of Cleveland.

43:16.694 --> 43:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cleveland's been through a lot
of troubles
as a city.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chicago has, too.

43:21.232 --> 43:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got a lot of financial
problems.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing that connects
everybody, and
the suffering is especially for
the Cubs,

43:26.270 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, don't forget, we have a
South Side
team called the White Sox, and
they won the

43:29.841 --> 43:31.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
World Series in 2005.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that appeased a lot of
people who are
Sox fans.

43:34.879 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Cubs fans, you can go back.

43:36.681 --> 43:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, my grandson, well, they
live -- I
go to visit them in Columbus,
and he's being

43:42.353 --> 43:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised, I'm afraid, an Indians
fan by my son-in-law,
Mike Edmonds (ph), and my
daughter, who's

43:46.858 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a die-hard Cubs fan.

43:48.659 --> 43:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at any rate, there are fans
who go back
grandchild, child, father, my
father, and

43:57.235 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then my grandfather.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of us saw the Cubs win the
World Series.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that bonding, that suffering
is always
there.

44:03.174 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you build kind of a hard
shell to prevent
yourself from suffering more.

44:09.146 --> 44:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Cubs get close, people
say, oh, no,
I know they are going to blow
it.

44:12.550 --> 44:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know it's going to happen.

44:14.385 --> 44:17.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they just say that just
because they can't
take their heart and rip it
apart again.

44:17.455 --> 44:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can list the years that I have
been alive
for the heartbreak.

44:20.458 --> 44:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's 1969, those Cubs, the '84
Cubs, when
the ball went through Leon
Durham's legs and

44:25.563 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they lost to the Padres; '89,
they were in
the playoffs and lost, '98; 2003
was perhaps

44:31.836 --> 44:33.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the biggest heartbreaker of them
all.

44:33.738 --> 44:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 2007 and 2008, they had
outstanding teams
and they got swept each year in
the first

44:40.578 --> 44:41.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
round of the playoffs.

44:41.579 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And people were like, what?

44:42.780 --> 44:44.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have no idea.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, believe me, you build up
that defense
system just to protect yourself.

44:47.785 --> 44:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Al, what about Tribe
fans?

44:51.055 --> 44:52.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go back to '97.

44:52.056 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a little fresher, the 1997
World Series.

44:55.726 --> 44:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Talk about some of that pain.

44:56.727 --> 44:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL PAWLOWSKI: Well, I'll tell
you what.

44:58.529 --> 45:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still remember where I was the
moment that
the '97 World Series was
happening, and we're

45:02.366 --> 45:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching game seven, and they're
playing the
Marlins.

45:04.635 --> 45:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Indians have this 3-2
lead heading
into the ninth inning.

45:07.505 --> 45:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I still didn't feel like,
oh, they are
going to win it, it's going to
be fine, because

45:11.375 --> 45:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of what Rick just said, we
have that
here too in Cleveland.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in Chicago, they have
champions.

45:17.448 --> 45:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You mentioned the White Sox.

45:18.449 --> 45:19.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They have them.

45:19.650 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have had the Blackhawks
with what they
have won.

45:20.585 --> 45:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Bulls won all those titles.

45:22.887 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up until the Cavaliers won this
summer, no
Cleveland major professional
sports franchise

45:27.325 --> 45:28.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had won a championship.

45:28.859 --> 45:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, similar to what the Cubs go
through, Indians
go through, too.

45:32.830 --> 45:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that feeling of, boy, is
something going
to go wrong, is something going
to happen

45:36.701 --> 45:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this year like it always has in
years past?

45:38.836 --> 45:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the good news is, and the
big difference,
with the Cavaliers winning a
championship

45:42.807 --> 45:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in June, you really can see a
change in attitude
here in the city, in the fans.

45:48.112 --> 45:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of feeling, boy, how are
the Cubs
going to beat the Indians now in
the World

45:51.315 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Series, now it's more like --
and we saw this
throughout October -- how does
this baseball

45:55.920 --> 45:57.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
team find a way to win?

45:57.088 --> 45:59.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because they always seem to find
a way to
win.

45:59.323 --> 46:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now there is a confidence here
that maybe
wasn't here back in the '90s,
when the Indians

46:03.961 --> 46:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
played the Braves in '95 and
then the Marlins
in '97.

46:07.031 --> 46:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Al, you talk about
the Cavs.

46:08.833 --> 46:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow is not just game one of
the World
Series, the season opener for
the Cavaliers,

46:13.537 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raising the championship banner.

46:15.473 --> 46:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning in The Sun-Times,
Rick wrote
that may be another -- it's
already a lot

46:20.311 --> 46:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of success for Cleveland.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wrote: "Dare I say this?

46:24.081 --> 46:27.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Cleveland, city of solid
Midwestern folks,
take a knee."

46:28.019 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Al, you got Rick here.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to that?

46:30.621 --> 46:32.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:32.456 --> 46:34.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL PAWLOWSKI: Well, there's no
way we're taking
a knee now, because this might
be the only

46:34.125 --> 46:36.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year that Cleveland can win
multiple sports
championships.

46:36.394 --> 46:39.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it hasn't happened since
1948.

46:39.497 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The Browns did.

46:40.498 --> 46:41.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The Indians did.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Cleveland has a chance to win
a couple,
they are going to go for it.

46:44.502 --> 46:45.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I understand what he is
saying.

46:45.936 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hey, the Cubs, it's been a while
for them.

46:48.272 --> 46:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to see this town, and you
talked about
it, right now -- I was just
outside a few

46:52.309 --> 46:54.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moments ago, and all the stages
set up.

46:54.912 --> 46:56.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All the networks are here.

46:56.247 --> 46:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're here to cover the
Cavaliers.

46:58.082 --> 46:59.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're here to cover the
Indians.

46:59.250 --> 47:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had the Republican National
Convention
in July.

47:02.186 --> 47:03.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Same type of deal.

47:04.021 --> 47:07.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suddenly, Cleveland is the big
media center
of the world when it comes to
sports, at least

47:07.591 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Tuesday night for game one,
and then also
for the Cavaliers opening up and
getting their

47:11.962 --> 47:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rings when they take on the
Knicks.

47:13.931 --> 47:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really a magical time.

47:15.766 --> 47:19.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you have been a lifelong
Clevelander,
or at least a Cleveland sports
fan, you never

47:19.603 --> 47:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought you would experience
something like
this.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now that it's here, it's
just truly wonderful
to be a part of it.

47:24.809 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Al, Rick, two great
cities, two
great teams.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's hope for a great series.

47:29.313 --> 47:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks for being with us.

47:30.314 --> 47:35.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL PAWLOWSKI: You got it.

47:36.020 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sounds good.

47:41.258 --> 47:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

47:49.900 --> 47:51.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

47:51.836 --> 47:57.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the Smithsonian
Institution asked
the public for help in saving
Dorothy's ruby

47:57.308 --> 47:58.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slippers.

47:58.476 --> 48:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
has this update.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: It's too
late.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There they are, and there they
will stay.

48:04.615 --> 48:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: For more than 30
years, Dorothy's
ruby slippers from the 1939
classic "The Wizard

48:09.253 --> 48:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Oz" have stayed at the
Smithsonian National
Museum of American History.

48:14.125 --> 48:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Entertainment curator Ryan
Lintelman said
the display is one of the most
popular at

48:18.129 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the museum.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN LINTELMAN, Smithsonian
National Museum
of American History: I see
people's faces

48:21.499 --> 48:24.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
light up the first time they see
the ruby
slippers, and the glimmer of the
sequins,

48:24.602 --> 48:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it always puts a smile on my
face.

48:26.537 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it reminds me of what we do
here at the
museum is connect people to
their shared history.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody loves the ruby
slippers.

48:31.976 --> 48:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: But the slippers,
one of several
pairs crafted almost 80 years
ago by MGM's

48:36.714 --> 48:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prop department, were only meant
to last through
filming, not the test of time,
and the size

48:42.219 --> 48:45.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
five shoes have begun to show
their age.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Threads have come loose.

48:46.924 --> 48:51.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The soles' felt, which muffled
sound as Judy
Garland danced along the Yellow
Brick Road,

48:51.362 --> 48:52.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has degraded.

48:52.797 --> 48:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the famous sequins, once a
deep red hue,
have faded and dulled.

48:57.701 --> 48:59.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Preservation services manager
Richard Barden:

48:59.603 --> 49:01.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BARDEN, Smithsonian
National Museum
of American History: They are
really discolored.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have darkened.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have become really opaque.

49:05.609 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there is cracking.

49:06.710 --> 49:09.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want the sequins to always be
ruby.

49:09.647 --> 49:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to save that color.

49:11.849 --> 49:15.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Now the museum is
now is in
a race against time to clean and
preserve

49:15.619 --> 49:18.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the shoes before it's too late.

49:18.389 --> 49:23.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As it is, the federal government
covers only
funds about 60 percent of the
Smithsonian

49:23.093 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Institution's budget.

49:24.895 --> 49:28.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to conserve the slippers, the
museum has
turned to crowdfunding in hopes
that the public

49:28.766 --> 49:30.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will help foot the bill.

49:30.668 --> 49:35.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week, it launched a
campaign on the Web
site Kickstarter to cover the
estimated $300,000

49:35.706 --> 49:37.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cost.

49:37.141 --> 49:38.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RYAN LINTELMAN: This is
something that everybody
is kind of invested in.

49:38.976 --> 49:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So many people love "The Wizard
of Oz," so
we want to give people the
opportunity through

49:42.179 --> 49:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this platform to contribute
anything from
a dollar to $10,000.

49:46.450 --> 49:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody feels like they own
"The Wizard
of Oz" in a way, because that's
our American

49:49.453 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fairy tale.

49:50.721 --> 49:52.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now they can help us
preserve the ruby
slippers.

49:52.122 --> 49:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: It's the second
such fund hosted
by the Smithsonian.

49:55.259 --> 50:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A similar campaign by the Air
and Space Museum
last summer raised more than
$700,000 to restore

50:01.198 --> 50:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Neil Armstrong's spacesuit.

50:03.334 --> 50:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yesterday, just six days
after the Kickstarter
began, more than 5,000 donors
helped the Smithsonian

50:09.406 --> 50:10.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reach its goal.

50:10.574 --> 50:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY GARLAND, Actress: There's
no place like
home.

50:13.110 --> 50:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Now the ruby
slippers will
also get a new home: a
state-of-the-art display

50:17.581 --> 50:20.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case designed to prevent further
degradation.

50:20.451 --> 50:29.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin
in Washington, D.C.

50:29.360 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And again to our
honor roll
of American service personnel
killed in Iraq

50:39.470 --> 50:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Afghanistan conflict.

50:41.538 --> 50:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We add them as their deaths are
made official
and photographs become
available.

50:49.413 --> 50:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here, in silence, are two more.
