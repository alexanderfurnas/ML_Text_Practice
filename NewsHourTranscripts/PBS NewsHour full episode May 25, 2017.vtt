JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.939 --> 00:06.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.775 --> 00:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Twenty-three of the 28 member
nations are

00:11.011 --> 00:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still not paying what they
should be paying.

00:13.079 --> 00:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
abroad, today
in Brussels, reprimands fellow
NATO leaders

00:19.285 --> 00:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over unpaid dues, but is silent
on NATO's
joint defense pact.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: the Manchester attack.

00:27.127 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain remains on high alert,
as U.S. intelligence-sharing
in the investigation was
temporarily halted,

00:33.466 --> 00:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a casualty of media leaks.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And gender on the job.

00:38.405 --> 00:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is testosterone an indicator of
who takes
risk at work?

00:42.342 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER LERNER, Harvard
University: There's
a systematic relationship there.

00:45.578 --> 00:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all explained through
testosterone
as a kind of social dominance
hormone.

00:50.950 --> 00:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.724 --> 00:59.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.793 --> 01:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A note of some
discord today,
as President Trump addressed his
first meeting

01:12.172 --> 01:13.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of NATO leaders.

01:13.940 --> 01:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He criticized the allies, again,
for falling
short on their share of defense
spending.

01:19.145 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Brussels, special
correspondent Ryan
Chilcote begins our coverage.

01:23.416 --> 01:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Jets blazed over
Brussels and
NATO's gleaming new headquarters
this afternoon,

01:28.555 --> 01:33.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the flags of all 28 member
states making a
show of unity.

01:33.493 --> 01:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a short time earlier, with
his fellow
leaders looking on, President
Trump renewed

01:37.697 --> 01:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his longstanding demand: NATO
allies must
do more.

01:41.301 --> 01:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Member nations are still not
paying what they

01:44.671 --> 01:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be paying and what they
are supposed
to be paying for their defense.

01:51.978 --> 01:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not fair to the people
and taxpayers
of the United States.

01:57.016 --> 02:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of these nations owe
massive amounts
of money from past years.

02:01.421 --> 02:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: The president
noted the bloc
did, however, shell out for a
new home.

02:05.325 --> 02:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I never asked once
what the
new NATO headquarters cost.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I refuse to do that.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it is beautiful.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: German Chancellor
Angela Merkel,
speaking before the president,
struck a different

02:21.174 --> 02:23.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
note in unveiling a memorial to
the Berlin
Wall.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): Our alliance is
united in the

02:26.813 --> 02:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awareness of the importance of
cooperation
to insist on freedom.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not isolation and the
building of walls
that make us successful, but
open societies

02:34.988 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that share the same values.

02:36.856 --> 02:40.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RYAN CHILCOTE: NATO's
secretary-general said
the unveilings of the wall and
wreckage from

02:40.927 --> 02:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the World Trade Center in New
York signify
the importance of the alliance.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General:
We saw the strength of that bond
after the

02:48.434 --> 02:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
9/11 attacks, and for the first
time, NATO
invoked our collective defense
clause, Article

02:57.477 --> 03:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
V, one for all and all for one.

03:01.881 --> 03:07.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Mr. Trump didn't
explicitly
endorse Article V, the first
president who

03:07.220 --> 03:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hasn't since the alliance's
founding in 1949.

03:11.558 --> 03:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After calling NATO obsolete last
year, a comment
he's since walked back, NATO
leaders seemed

03:17.230 --> 03:18.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dismayed.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump did, though,
appear to push
the prime minister of Montenegro
aside as

03:22.635 --> 03:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders moved through a hall,
all of this
in a city that candidate Trump
called a hellhole

03:28.508 --> 03:30.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

03:30.443 --> 03:36.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump has also
criticized the European
Union, the other big institution
headquartered

03:36.115 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Brussels, applauding
Britain's decision
to exit the bloc.

03:40.820 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U.'s two leaders who share
the job of
running the bloc of 28
countries, the president

03:45.458 --> 03:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the European commission,
Jean-Claude Juncker,
and the president of the
European Council,

03:49.729 --> 03:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Tusk, also met President
Trump today.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the meeting, it was clear
that differences
remained.

03:55.535 --> 04:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: Some
issues remain open, like climate
and trade.

04:01.307 --> 04:07.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am not 100 percent sure
that we can
say today -- we means Mr.
President and myself

04:07.680 --> 04:13.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- that we have a common
position, common
opinion about Russia.

04:13.319 --> 04:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: The new American
president
also held his first meeting with
France's

04:17.724 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
newly elected president,
Emmanuel Macron.

04:20.960 --> 04:26.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The handshake lasted six
seconds, and the
39-year-old Frenchman held his
own.

04:26.833 --> 04:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In private, the president of
France urged
Mr. Trump to respect the Paris
climate agreement.

04:32.171 --> 04:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, after a long day in
Brussels, the
president flew on to Sicily for
the G7 summit

04:38.578 --> 04:40.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

04:40.213 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a short time
ago, I spoke
with Ryan Chilcote from
Brussels.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ryan, welcome.

04:46.252 --> 04:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how did the European leaders
react to
President Trump's criticisms
today?

04:51.124 --> 04:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, they have
been very reserved,
very guarded in their response
to President

04:57.030 --> 04:58.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's criticism today.

04:58.898 --> 05:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't forget that a good number
of the leaders,
in fact, those that President
Trump, I think,

05:03.136 --> 05:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been hardest on when it
comes to their
commitments to NATO, are going
to see him

05:08.207 --> 05:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Sicily tomorrow, so they
don't want a spat
with President Trump.

05:12.111 --> 05:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, they will clearly
be very disappointed
by the criticism today.

05:17.550 --> 05:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of them feel that the
place where President
Trump delivered his criticism
was the wrong

05:23.923 --> 05:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place to do it, beside this
memorial that
effectively wasn't just to U.S.
troops, but

05:29.796 --> 05:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also to NATO troops who have
lost their lives
in Afghanistan fighting
alongside the United

05:37.603 --> 05:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States after NATO invoked
Article V.

05:41.107 --> 05:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they don't like where the
comments were
made.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the other issue, of
course, is that
many of them disagree that
they're not doing

05:48.648 --> 05:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough or moving in the right
direction to
support NATO in terms of their
military spending.

05:54.954 --> 06:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president pointed out that
23 out of the
28 NATO members are not spending
2 percent

06:00.360 --> 06:05.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their budgets on the military
at this point
-- of their GDP.

06:05.131 --> 06:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will say that, in fact,
if you look
at the commitment, they have
until 2024 to

06:11.637 --> 06:13.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here at NATO, from the NATO
officials
I have talked to, they believe
that the vast

06:16.242 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority of the NATO countries
are well on
their way with verifiable plans
to do that,

06:21.547 --> 06:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the notable exception of
Germany.

06:24.417 --> 06:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they weren't showing that
because they
want to work with President
Trump, and they

06:29.989 --> 06:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly believe -- and that was
very apparent
in the language, the body
language today -- that

06:34.427 --> 06:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a president that they
need to win
over.

06:37.096 --> 06:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to assure him that
NATO is something
that's in the United States'
interest.

06:42.969 --> 06:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
Ryan, you were
just in Russia.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You covered the Kremlin for,
what, 20 years.

06:49.108 --> 06:52.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think Russia, the
Russian officials
are thinking about today's
meeting?

06:52.812 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, I wouldn't
say that they
would be delighted with today's
meeting, because,

06:56.282 --> 06:59.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of course, they're never
delighted by anything
that NATO does.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They see NATO as a threat to
Russia.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they will be happier about
this meeting
than they were about the meeting
that we saw

07:05.992 --> 07:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last year or the year before.

07:07.860 --> 07:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, it was at those
meetings that NATO
took a very hard line on Russia
in the aftermath

07:14.434 --> 07:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Russia's intervention in
Ukraine.

07:16.636 --> 07:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was those meetings that led
to the deployment
of about 3,000 NATO troops,
troops under NATO's

07:22.375 --> 07:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
command right really at Russia's
border in
the Baltic countries and in
Poland.

07:27.513 --> 07:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that we didn't get
that explicit
expression of support from
Article V from

07:34.420 --> 07:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today, these are
the things
that the Russians will be very
pleased about.

07:38.658 --> 07:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, any
sense of
what the Trump administration,
the Trump delegation

07:44.464 --> 07:45.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thinks about all this?

07:45.765 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, they said
that the meeting
was a success.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer spoke with reporters
after.

07:50.870 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said that, you know, the
president's
hard line, if you will, the
criticism that

07:55.975 --> 08:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has been consistent with for
the last year-and-a-half,
is really paying dividends.

08:01.113 --> 08:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that the meeting, the
dinner meeting,
tonight started with a
discussion about how

08:06.486 --> 08:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the countries can share more of
the burden,
how they can participate in
counterterrorism

08:11.491 --> 08:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along with the United States.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those have been two key demands
from President
Trump.

08:16.128 --> 08:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And really, Sean Spicer, for
one, played down
the idea that President Trump
should have

08:22.668 --> 08:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explicitly supported or endorsed
Article V,
you know, saying, look, he was
there to dedicate

08:31.043 --> 08:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- to read the dedication, to
give a speech
at a memorial that is called
Article V and

08:37.316 --> 08:39.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
9/11.

08:39.118 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, of course, the president
even by just
being here at the NATO meeting
supports Article

08:43.022 --> 08:43.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
V.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he has pushed back on all
that.

08:45.758 --> 08:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see the president's tough
line here at
NATO and in Europe in general as
the right

08:50.129 --> 08:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach, the only way that's
going to get
the goods that they want
delivered.

08:53.466 --> 08:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ryan Chilcote,
covering today's
NATO meeting in Brussels, thank
you.

08:59.739 --> 09:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
federal appeals
court in Richmond, Virginia,
upheld a lower

09:04.210 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court ruling that blocked
President Trump's
revised travel ban.

09:08.614 --> 09:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The appellate judges of the
Fourth Circuit
said the policy, targeting six
mostly Muslim

09:13.519 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nations -- quote -- "drips with
religious
intolerance."

09:17.056 --> 09:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first appeals court to
rule on the
revised ban.

09:20.626 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Justice Department says that
it will appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

09:25.264 --> 09:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon has concluded that
a U.S. airstrike
in Iraq last March led to the
death of at

09:30.870 --> 09:33.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
least 105 civilians.

09:33.472 --> 09:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened in Mosul, where
government forces
are fighting to retake the city
from the Islamic

09:38.611 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
State group.

09:40.446 --> 09:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators say they found
that a U.S. bomb
dropped on a building set off
explosives that

09:45.351 --> 09:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS fighters had planted
inside.

09:47.386 --> 09:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The airstrike was originally
intended to kill
two snipers.

09:52.191 --> 09:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's government is protesting
after a U.S.
warship sailed close to manmade
islands in

09:57.863 --> 09:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the South China Sea today.

09:59.799 --> 10:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guided missile destroyer
Dewey came within
12 nautical miles of Mischief
Reef, which

10:05.938 --> 10:08.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Chinese now claim.

10:08.074 --> 10:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said
the U.S. challenge hurts efforts
to resolve

10:13.279 --> 10:15.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disputes.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): The U.S.'
actions bring

10:17.717 --> 10:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
severe disruptions to the
process of negotiations,
and can only bring harm and not
benefits.

10:23.189 --> 10:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's resolve to protect its
sovereign territory,
security and maritime interests
is resolute.

10:28.494 --> 10:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. disputes
China's claim
and says that it will continue
to conduct

10:32.832 --> 10:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedom of navigation exercises
in the area.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the first one since
President Trump
took office.

10:39.538 --> 10:44.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Government troops in the
Philippines launched
a new operation today to retake
control of

10:44.243 --> 10:47.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a southern city from Islamist
militants.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soldiers arrived in Marawi
backed by tanks
and attack helicopters.

10:51.484 --> 10:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rebels have sealed off much
of the city,
and thousands of people have
fled.

10:57.423 --> 11:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Brazil, President Michel
Temer has canceled
a decree that deployed the
military last night,

11:04.764 --> 11:06.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after violent protests.

11:06.599 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An estimated 45,000 people
marched in the
capital, Brasilia, demanding
that Temer resign

11:13.205 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over corruption allegations.

11:15.474 --> 11:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police fired tear gas and pepper
spray when
some protesters set fires and
vandalized government

11:21.547 --> 11:22.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
buildings.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It
doesn't represent
the people.

11:25.317 --> 11:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a movement created by
unions, because
to protest is correct, but
vandalism is totally

11:30.356 --> 11:31.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrong.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they did is an example of
savagery.

11:33.292 --> 11:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
approve demonstrations,
but I thought it was absurd on
both sides.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Military police also made a
serious mistake
in targeting demonstrators.

11:41.033 --> 11:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Temer initially
said he called
out troops in a bid to restore
order.

11:46.238 --> 11:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He retreated after widespread
criticism that
it was a power grab.

11:51.277 --> 11:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI has declined, for now,
to hand over
to Congress documents on former
Director James

11:57.349 --> 11:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comey's communications with the
president.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The House Oversight Committee
wanted the material.

12:02.755 --> 12:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, former U.S. Senator
Joe Lieberman
withdrew from consideration to
be the next

12:08.394 --> 12:10.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FBI director.

12:10.196 --> 12:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He cited a potential conflict of
interests,
now that one of his law partners
is representing

12:14.633 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president in the probe of
ties between
his campaign and the Russians.

12:20.072 --> 12:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OPEC today extended an agreement
to cut output
for another nine months in an
effort to shore

12:26.312 --> 12:27.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up prices.

12:27.980 --> 12:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agreement includes the 14
members of the
oil cartel, plus 10 other
nations.

12:33.385 --> 12:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the deal, oil prices
fell today back
under $50 a barrel.

12:39.024 --> 12:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And long-term U.S. mortgage
rates fell this
week, to the lowest levels of
the year.

12:43.996 --> 12:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said
that the benchmark
30-year-rate dipped below 4
percent.

12:50.336 --> 12:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street scored new
gains, as big retailers
reported strong earnings.

12:55.074 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 70
points to close near 21083.

12:59.478 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 42, and the S&amp;P
500 added
10, both of those indexes
closing at record

13:08.287 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
highs.

13:10.222 --> 13:15.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Manchester
attack leaks from the
investigation temporarily

13:15.060 --> 13:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pause intelligence-sharing; fear
of Russia
-- Sweden invests in its
military as a precaution

13:22.835 --> 13:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against neighboring Russia; and
much more.

13:36.916 --> 13:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a day for mourning in
Manchester,
England, and for new police
raids in the concert

13:42.688 --> 13:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bombing that killed 22 people.

13:45.724 --> 13:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police say they have very
important clues
to what drove Salman Abedi and
10 other suspects

13:52.398 --> 13:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to potential -- and to other
suspects.

13:54.967 --> 13:59.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ciaran Jenkins of Independent
Television News
has our report.

13:59.104 --> 14:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: At 11:00 a.m. in
the spring
sunshine, Manchester fell
silent, united in

14:10.082 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grief.

14:11.383 --> 14:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a moment, remembrance
outshone the darkness
of terror.

14:17.356 --> 14:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was for the dead, the
injured, their
families and friends.

14:22.561 --> 14:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At dawn, another raid a mile
from the Didsbury
Mosque, where Salman Abedi
worshiped.

14:30.135 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're closing in on his
movements.

14:31.904 --> 14:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the night of the attack, he
was in this
rented property police raided
yesterday.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say they have made
significant arrests,
eight in total.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This man was apprehended
yesterday in Wigan.

14:43.282 --> 14:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A property there is being
searched tonight,
as well as two other properties
in Manchester.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But investigators face an
unwelcomed obstacle.

14:52.024 --> 14:56.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times published
photos of bomb
components from the scene of the
blast, the

14:56.595 --> 14:58.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
latest leak from U.S.
intelligence.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN HOPKINS, Greater Manchester
Chief Constable:
Last night, the family liaison
officer shared

15:01.066 --> 15:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with those families the fact
that intelligence
had been leaked and published in
The New York

15:06.639 --> 15:08.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Times.

15:08.474 --> 15:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is absolutely understandable
the distress
and upset that this caused to
those families,

15:13.646 --> 15:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are already suffering, as
everyone can
imagine.

15:16.882 --> 15:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: The queen today
saw for herself
the children Salman Abedi deemed
terror targets.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, United
Kingdom: And you
had enjoyed the concert?

15:25.224 --> 15:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIRL: Yes, it was really good.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: She spoke with
15-year-old
Millie.

15:29.395 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to 14-year-old Evie, she
made her own
disgust with the attacker known.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUEEN ELIZABETH II: Very wicked.

15:38.904 --> 15:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: But the terror
network who
did this is still being hunted.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The threat level remains at its
highest.

15:47.446 --> 15:53.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And major English hospitals have
been told
to prepare for similar attacks.

15:53.152 --> 15:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As of this afternoon, you will
see armed police
on trains nationwide for the
first time.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Britain remains under imminent
threat.

16:02.561 --> 16:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we
examine the diplomatic
fight that's broken out over the
leaked photos

16:08.267 --> 16:11.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the bomb detonated in
Manchester.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes it from
here.

16:13.038 --> 16:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: U.K. officials
are so incensed
over those photos being shared
that the police

16:17.676 --> 16:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stopped sharing information with
the U.S.
for a time today.

16:21.213 --> 16:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Prime Minister
Theresa May met
with President Trump at the NATO
summit in

16:24.850 --> 16:26.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brussels.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going in, she said she wants to
maintain the
special security partnership
with the U.S.

16:30.089 --> 16:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: That
partnership is built on trust.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of that trust is
knowing that intelligence
can be shared confidently.

16:38.497 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will be making clear to
President Trump
today that intelligence shared
between law

16:43.502 --> 16:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enforcement agencies must remain
secure.

16:45.971 --> 16:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president,
in turn,
issued his own statement
condemning the leaks.

16:49.975 --> 16:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He asked the Justice Department
and other
agencies to launch a -- quote --
"complete

16:54.079 --> 16:55.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation."

16:56.015 --> 17:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, and the
broader investigation
into the bombing, I'm joined now
by Ali Soufan.

17:00.219 --> 17:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former FBI special agent
who handled
several major terrorism
investigations, including

17:05.557 --> 17:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 2001 al-Qaida bombing of the
USS Cole
in Yemen.

17:09.128 --> 17:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now runs a consulting group
and is author
of the book "Anatomy of Terror."

17:12.364 --> 17:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour."

17:13.465 --> 17:15.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALI SOUFAN, Former FBI
Interrogator: Thank
you.

17:15.801 --> 17:20.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From an
investigator's point
of view, help me understand why
the British

17:20.973 --> 17:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be so angry about these
photos of these
bomb-making parts, why those
being out there

17:26.211 --> 17:27.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would bother them so much.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALI SOUFAN: Well, they have an
ongoing investigation.

17:29.081 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this investigation is way
more than an
act that already happened.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an imminent threat
that's unfolding
in the U.K.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You want to protect your
investigative leads,
number one.

17:40.259 --> 17:45.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You need to protect the
integrity of your
evidence and of your
investigation.

17:45.097 --> 17:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you're trying to catch
terrorists
who are still on the loose, you
know, you

17:50.903 --> 17:53.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't want them to know what you
know.

17:53.105 --> 17:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as an investigator, you know
-- and it
happened to me personally -- you
get so frustrated

17:59.278 --> 18:05.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
when you see sometimes,
intentionally or
unintentionally,
people hindering your
investigation.

18:05.684 --> 18:11.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I don't blame the
investigators on the
ground to be really upset about
leaks, about

18:11.757 --> 18:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any investigative leaks that
have been published
either in papers or broadcast on
television.

18:18.363 --> 18:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am just not sure they can put
all the blame
on the United States.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's very unfair.

18:27.239 --> 18:31.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, even in the
pictures in The New
York Times, I believe, in The
New York Times'

18:31.610 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story, they said that they got
access to them
from British law enforcement
sources.

18:36.615 --> 18:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think leaks are really bad in
this situation.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not only reckless.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's dangerous when you have
terrorists still
on the loose.

18:45.157 --> 18:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to blame everything on the
people here
in the United States, I think
it's not fair.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they need to do a
further investigation
to know who's leaking what to
whom.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just so I'm
clear on this,
the concern would be that let's
just say the

18:58.337 --> 19:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspects in this case were to
see those photographs.

19:01.206 --> 19:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would somehow know exactly
what amount
of evidence the police had in
their custody,

19:06.979 --> 19:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that might then lead them to
think, oh,
they're much closer to getting
me than I thought.

19:10.883 --> 19:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI SOUFAN: Well, first of all,
I think the
British were really upset about
leaking the

19:15.754 --> 19:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
name of the suicide bomber.

19:18.357 --> 19:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe, as an investigator, I
don't want the
name to be out, I want them to
know that -- I

19:23.195 --> 19:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want them to think that I'm
still in the dark,
so I can have the advantage in
identifying

19:28.200 --> 19:33.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his friends, his support
network, people who
probably are working with him or
supported

19:33.138 --> 19:34.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him or aid him.

19:34.706 --> 19:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, so I wanted to have
the upper hand
in these kind of things.

19:39.077 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for other evidence that's
collected from
the scene, they will be
watching, and they

19:45.150 --> 19:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be hearing our analysis of
it.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe they will even know
how to do it
better.

19:51.657 --> 19:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember, in some of the
stories, there
was some analytical pieces about
what's wrong

19:59.765 --> 20:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the device, what's wrong
with the detonator.

20:02.668 --> 20:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to be very careful,
especially when
you have an ongoing
investigation unfolding,

20:09.741 --> 20:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so dangerous to our partners in
the U.K.,
that they raised the threat
level in the country

20:15.347 --> 20:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to critical, which is the third
time they
did that in, like, 10 years.

20:20.052 --> 20:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have to be very careful,
and we have
to respect the circumstances on
the ground,

20:26.525 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help them protect the integrity
of their investigation,
but also aid them to arrest and
apprehend

20:35.634 --> 20:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who might be involved in
the attack
in Manchester or probably
another imminent

20:41.673 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack that might be taking
place.

20:43.275 --> 20:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ISIS, as you
know, took
credit for this.

20:46.678 --> 20:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some have theorized that
ISIS will encourage
more and more attacks like this
as they lose

20:52.117 --> 20:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more and more territory and
fighters in Syria
and Iraq.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you believe that assessment?

20:57.356 --> 21:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think that this is a sign
of ISIS'
strength or is this a sign of
its weakness?

21:01.627 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALI SOUFAN: Well, it's
definitely a sign of
both.

21:04.596 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you know, ISIS is losing
territory
in Syria and Iraq.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS is losing the so-called
caliphate.

21:11.970 --> 21:17.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They always bragged it's
(INAUDIBLE) which
means remaining and expanding.

21:17.743 --> 21:22.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now it's definitely not
remaining and absolutely
not expanding.

21:22.881 --> 21:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are trying to inspire
people to do
terrorist attacks around the
world.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have seen that in the
United States.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen that in Europe.

21:31.256 --> 21:40.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what level of support, what
level of
coordination and direction ISIS
had with this

21:40.432 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Manchester bombing yet to be
seen.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of unknowns in
this.

21:45.237 --> 21:52.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for example, as we have
seen in the United
States, ISIS claimed
responsibility for attacks

21:52.044 --> 21:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they had nothing to do with
whatsoever,
just because they believed they
might inspire

21:57.883 --> 21:59.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that attack.

21:59.851 --> 22:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So now we're seeing -- with
these kind of
attacks, we're seeing the
boundaries, organizational

22:05.991 --> 22:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boundaries, becoming more and
more blurry,
and the threat is a message.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that message is the same.

22:13.832 --> 22:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remember, ISIS used to be a
branch of al-Qaida.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS came out of al-Qaida.

22:18.637 --> 22:19.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

22:19.938 --> 22:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI SOUFAN: So, ideologically
speaking, they
are the same.

22:23.075 --> 22:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Ali
Soufan, thank
you very much.

22:27.446 --> 22:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI SOUFAN: Thank you.

22:34.453 --> 22:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:38.657 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
stop the presses
-- does an assault by a
candidate represent

22:43.862 --> 22:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changed attitudes toward the
media?; gender
on the job -- is testosterone an
indicator

22:50.335 --> 22:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who takes risk at work?; and
a Brief But
Spectacular take on artificial
intelligence.

22:56.942 --> 23:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As we reported
earlier, President
Trump was at NATO headquarters
today in Brussels.

23:03.915 --> 23:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The decades-old NATO alliance
has found new
meaning of late.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The main cause?

23:09.521 --> 23:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian muscle-flexing in Europe
and beyond.

23:12.557 --> 23:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several European nations are not
members of
the alliance, including Sweden.

23:17.295 --> 23:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now Swedes are enlarging
their military
in new ways, preparing for an
old threat.

23:23.268 --> 23:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Swedish island of
Gotland in the
Baltic Sea, special
correspondent Malcolm

23:28.173 --> 23:30.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brabant reports.

23:30.142 --> 23:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Twelve years
after Sweden
deemed post-Soviet Russia to be
weak and demilitarized

23:36.515 --> 23:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gotland, the army is back.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Times have changed.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gotland is no longer immune from
danger.

23:44.389 --> 23:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 300-strong battle group,
including a part-time
tank company, will be in place
by July.

23:50.729 --> 23:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until then, the island has
become a stage
for war games, sending a
deterrent message

23:55.634 --> 23:56.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the Kremlin.

23:56.735 --> 23:57.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sergeant Major Henrik Wulff:

23:58.003 --> 23:58.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAJ.

24:00.806 --> 24:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRIK WULFF, Swedish Army
(through translator):
Now, this is part of their basic
military

24:01.740 --> 24:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
training, training as squads and
platoons.

24:04.576 --> 24:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, Gotland is
Swedish, and we
will protect Gotland to any
means necessary.

24:11.183 --> 24:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The recruits
are learning
to protect themselves from a
surprise attack.

24:16.922 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a country that epitomizes
peace, that's
a difficult scenario to grasp.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sweden has not fought a war
since 1814.

24:27.165 --> 24:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has nurtured its neutrality
for over 200
years.

24:30.869 --> 24:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the Cold War, it was
neutral because
it was suspicious of both the
superpowers.

24:35.740 --> 24:40.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now Russian muscle-flexing
is jangling
Swedish nerves.

24:40.245 --> 24:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government is promising to
increase defense
spending by 11 percent over the
next five

24:44.049 --> 24:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years and it is to reintroduce
conscription.

24:48.687 --> 24:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gotland is a popular Nordic
tourist destination.

24:51.523 --> 24:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's main town, Visby, the
best-preserved
fortified commercial city in
Northern Europe,

24:56.328 --> 24:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

24:59.798 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The island, a three-hour ferry
ride from the
Swedish mainland, is vulnerable
because of

25:03.935 --> 25:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its strategic location, close to
Latvia and
the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad, where

25:09.341 --> 25:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a quarter of a million military
personnel
are based.

MATTHIAS ARDIN, Swedish
Military: Gotland
is an area in the middle of the
Baltic Sea.

25:17.816 --> 25:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From this island, it is possible
to influence
both air and sea ways within the
area.

25:23.088 --> 25:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Colonel Ardin

25:27.926 --> 25:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHIAS ARDIN: Russia is
putting a lot of
money into their military force.

25:30.896 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a deteriorating security
situation
within the Baltics.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are trying to enhance our
military capabilities.

25:38.069 --> 25:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But do you
think Russia is
going to look at some of these
exercises and

25:42.207 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just laugh because you are
hopelessly outnumbered?

25:46.978 --> 25:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIAS ARDIN: I think Russia
follows the
developments in the Baltic
region like every

25:49.848 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other nation does.

25:51.716 --> 25:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Last week, the
Swedish defense
minister, Peter Hultqvist, was
at the Pentagon,

25:58.590 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raising concerns with Defense
Secretary James
Mattis.

26:00.992 --> 26:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HULTQVIST, Swedish Defense
Minister:
From my perspective, Russia is
the main challenge.

26:05.697 --> 26:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia challenged the European
security order.

26:08.934 --> 26:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has a destabilizing impact
on Northern
Europe and beyond.

26:14.406 --> 26:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Four years ago,
Russia simulated
a nuclear attack against Sweden
as part of

26:19.244 --> 26:20.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a military exercise.

26:20.979 --> 26:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its submarines and agents have
also reportedly
been probing Swedish defenses.

26:26.017 --> 26:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But political scientist Mi
Lennhag, a former
Foreign Ministry Russia
specialist, believes

26:30.488 --> 26:32.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Kremlin is bluffing.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MI LENNHAG, Political Scientist:
I think that
Putin and Kremlin, Russia, want
a bipolar

26:35.493 --> 26:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world again, where Putin is a
greater man
than Trump, and especially to
destabilize

26:42.467 --> 26:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe, to make sure that Europe
and Sweden
in this case and the Baltics
actually know

26:47.606 --> 26:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Russia is strong and
powerful -- and
it is -- and that the major goal
is to make

26:55.347 --> 26:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people aware of it, not to
really act on it.

26:57.782 --> 27:03.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Russia's
psychological offensive
has forced Sweden to address
defense personnel

27:03.588 --> 27:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shortages caused by young
people's reluctance
to sign up after the draft was
abolished in

27:09.628 --> 27:11.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

27:11.563 --> 27:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government is introducing a
form of targeted
conscription that will compel
4,000 18-year-olds

27:17.268 --> 27:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to undergo military training
every year.

27:19.270 --> 27:20.238 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAJ.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRIK WULFF: Our professional
soldiers are
very, very good.

27:23.675 --> 27:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But quantity is also a quality.

27:26.845 --> 27:29.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need more troops in
Sweden.

27:29.881 --> 27:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the conscript system is an
excellent way
for that.

27:32.951 --> 27:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: High school
student Albin
Gahm is one of 100,000 eligible
Swedes who'll

27:38.556 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be subjected to what is
effectively a draft
lottery.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALBIN GAHM, Student: Many of us
don't want
to fight.

27:42.961 --> 27:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to fight either,
but I know,
if I have to, I will do it.

27:47.465 --> 27:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's really divided.

27:49.334 --> 27:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I prefer to spend my
life as I want
to and die when I want to,
instead of having

27:55.707 --> 28:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the chance of ending when I
don't want to.

28:00.645 --> 28:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This air vent
represents
another impact of the Russian
threat.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's happening underneath places
like this
government-subsidized housing
project on the

28:08.720 --> 28:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outskirts of Gotland's main
town.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Garage 71 has a dual purpose.

28:14.559 --> 28:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Behind its heavy metal gate,
it's not only
a repository for old cars, but
also one of

28:19.330 --> 28:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
60,000 shelters built during the
Cold War,
when Sweden feared being caught
in the crossfire

28:25.470 --> 28:27.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a nuclear conflagration.

28:27.672 --> 28:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were mothballed after the
collapse of
the Soviet Union, but, as a
result of the

28:31.609 --> 28:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
current tensions, the Swedish
Contingency
Agency has ordered that the 350
bunkers on

28:37.215 --> 28:40.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gotland be restocked and
prepared.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This shelter is designed to
protect about
200 people.

28:43.955 --> 28:46.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are about 10 feet
underground.

28:46.091 --> 28:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this reinforced concrete is
supposed to
be able to take a direct hit in
a conventional

28:51.663 --> 28:53.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

28:53.465 --> 28:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In another part of the island at
a Cold War
military bunker, now a museum,
custodian Kjell

28:57.402 --> 29:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pettersson laments the return of
historical
tensions.

29:00.638 --> 29:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KJELL PETTERSSON, Custodian
(through translator):
I really hope that a conflict
won't happen.

29:04.976 --> 29:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in today's world, where so
much is happening
in the world around us, you just
don't know.

29:09.314 --> 29:11.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I am a bit worried.

29:11.116 --> 29:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The medieval
walls that ring
Visby were useless in 1808, when
a Russian

29:16.654 --> 29:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force temporarily took control
of Gotland,
before being expelled by the
Swedes.

29:22.193 --> 29:25.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In such tranquil surroundings,
it's hard for
some residents to comprehend
that this is

29:25.964 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once again a potential front
line.

29:27.799 --> 29:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA JAMES, Planning Official:
I would say,
as a Swede, we're still in the
mind-set that

29:30.635 --> 29:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're a neutral country and war
cannot happen
to us.

29:35.340 --> 29:38.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I guess we have to
reevaluate this.

29:38.343 --> 29:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Maria James is
a planning
official with the local
government.

29:42.413 --> 29:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's married to David James, an
American
security expert who hails from
Virginia.

29:46.317 --> 29:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA JAMES: If they want, they
can take Gotland
in a matter of days, I guess, or
hours even.

29:52.457 --> 29:59.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I would probably more
inclined just to
roll over, because I don't want
any casualties.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't want them to use
force.

30:01.933 --> 30:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The family is
standing besides
a component of Gotland's
defenses.

30:06.437 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This unprepossessing garage also
contains
a bomb shelter.

30:09.874 --> 30:12.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID JAMES, Resident of
Gotland: I'm not
at all positive about the
future, because,

30:12.043 --> 30:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, how can you be positive
with Trump
as president?

30:15.780 --> 30:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's something of a wild card.

30:18.716 --> 30:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the combination of Trump and
Putin and
North Korea and others, it just
really makes

30:27.559 --> 30:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things seem like, well, anything
could happen
really.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Russia's
aggression is creating
a dilemma for the Swedes.

30:34.399 --> 30:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're being pushed ever closer
to NATO,
but are resisting membership, an
act that

30:38.803 --> 30:42.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Putin would regard as
hostile.

30:42.106 --> 30:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gotland's deputy mayor, Meit
Fohlin, reflects
the view of the governing Social
Democratic

30:46.578 --> 30:48.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEIT FOHLIN, Gotland Deputy
Mayor: It is better
to be free and to have our
cooperations where

30:51.883 --> 30:53.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we want them to be.

30:53.685 --> 30:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that neutrality has
served us well
up to this day, and I think it
is the right

30:58.790 --> 31:00.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way even in the future.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Later this
summer, these
training exercises will be
supplanted by a

31:03.995 --> 31:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much bigger war game involving
20,000 Swedish
troops, as well as 1,000 U.S.
personnel.

31:11.002 --> 31:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite Sweden's fears, it's not
about to
join NATO, but Defense Secretary
Mattis gave

31:15.506 --> 31:17.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this pledge:

31:17.442 --> 31:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: America
will not abandon democratic
allies and partners.

31:21.179 --> 31:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will stand with Sweden,
and all democracies
will stand together.

31:25.617 --> 31:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The country's
best defense
may ultimately be the neutrality
upon which

31:30.088 --> 31:31.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's relied.

31:31.089 --> 31:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But being neutral doesn't mean
not being ready.

31:34.525 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Gotland.

31:42.133 --> 31:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today's closely
watched special
election for Montana's lone seat
in the U.S.

31:51.976 --> 31:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House of Representatives took a
bizarre turn
last night when the Republican
candidate was

31:57.248 --> 31:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charged with assaulting a news
reporter.

32:00.018 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The altercation, and other less
extreme incidents
involving journalists, raise
questions about

32:05.323 --> 32:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how attitudes toward the news
media may be
changing.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

32:10.428 --> 32:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The race between
Democrat Rob Quist
and Republican Greg Gianforte
was upended

32:15.633 --> 32:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in its closing hours when
Guardian reporter
Ben Jacobs tried to ask the
Republican about

32:21.172 --> 32:22.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the health care bill.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jacobs was recording the
conversation.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE (R), Montana
Congressional
Candidate: Yes, we'll talk to
you about that

32:26.911 --> 32:28.279 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
later.

32:28.313 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN JACOBS, The Guardian: Yes,
but there's
not going to be time.

32:28.913 --> 32:29.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm just curious...

32:29.914 --> 32:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE: OK, speak with
Shane, please.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm sick and tired of you guys!

32:33.685 --> 32:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN JACOBS: Jesus Christ!

32:35.119 --> 32:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE: The last guy you
came in here,
you did the same thing!

32:37.522 --> 32:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Get the hell out of here!

32:40.358 --> 32:41.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN JACOBS: Jesus!

32:41.759 --> 32:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE: Get the hell out
of here!

32:44.929 --> 32:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The last guy did the same thing!

32:46.297 --> 32:47.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You with The Guardian?

32:47.298 --> 32:48.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BEN JACOBS: Yes!

32:48.299 --> 32:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you just broke my glasses.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE: The last guy did
the same
damn thing.

32:50.735 --> 32:51.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN JACOBS: You just
body-slammed me and broke
my glasses.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE: Get the hell out
of here.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Gianforte's press
secretary said,
"Aggressive behavior from a
liberal journalist

32:56.908 --> 32:58.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
created this scene."

32:58.576 --> 33:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But a FOX News team witnessed
the confrontation.

33:01.179 --> 33:06.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALICIA ACUNA, FOX News:
Gianforte grabbed
him by the neck, both hands,
slid him to the

33:06.551 --> 33:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, body-slammed him, and then
got on top
of him and started punching, and
then yelling

33:11.222 --> 33:12.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at him.

33:12.890 --> 33:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late last night, the
sheriff charged
Gianforte with misdemeanor
assault.

33:17.762 --> 33:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, House Speaker Paul
Ryan said
he was out of line.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: There
is no time where a physical
altercation should

33:24.902 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occur with the press or with --
just between
human beings.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that is wrong and should no
have happened.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should the gentleman apologize?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, I think he should
apologize.

33:36.047 --> 33:41.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi
compared Gianforte to President
Trump.

33:41.819 --> 33:43.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
To see this person who wants to
be the one

33:45.623 --> 33:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
representative into the House of
Representatives
from Montana be sort of a
wannabe Trump, it's

33:52.630 --> 33:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a tactic to attack the press.

33:54.499 --> 34:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really have to say, this
is about the
Constitution of the United
States.

34:00.138 --> 34:06.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump, as
candidate and as
president, has targeted media
with harsh language

34:06.511 --> 34:08.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of his own.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The dishonest media, among the
world's most

34:10.648 --> 34:11.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dishonest people.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

34:13.384 --> 34:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There have been other
incidents
involving public officials and
reporters.

34:16.821 --> 34:20.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A West Virginia public radio
reporter was
arrested trying to question
Health and Human

34:20.625 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Services Secretary Tom Price.

34:22.860 --> 34:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a Congressional Quarterly
reporter was
allegedly manhandled by security
guards when

34:27.532 --> 34:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he tried to ask a question after
an FCC hearing.

34:31.035 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To explore the meaning of these
incidents,
we're joined by Howard Kurtz,
host of "Media

34:35.306 --> 34:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Buzz" on FOX News Channel, and
Tom Rosenstiel,
head of the American Press
Institute and a

34:40.511 --> 34:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.

34:42.647 --> 34:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Howie, Tom, thanks for being
here.

34:44.215 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tom, let me start with you.

34:46.117 --> 34:51.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there a change in the
climate, a change
in attitudes toward the press?

34:51.289 --> 34:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM ROSENSTIEL, Executive
Director, American
Press Institute: Yes.

34:53.124 --> 34:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we're seeing rhetoric,
we're hearing
rhetoric from the White House
that is of a

34:57.528 --> 35:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nature that we really haven't
seen since President
Nixon and the Watergate era, a
demonization

35:03.868 --> 35:05.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the press.

35:05.736 --> 35:10.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's qualitatively different
than simply accusing
the press of liberal bias or
unfairness.

35:10.808 --> 35:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, to say that they are the
enemy of
the people, among the worst
human beings on

35:15.780 --> 35:24.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
earth, it encourages and
legitimizes an anger
towards the press that, you
know, I think,

35:24.088 --> 35:25.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fosters this attitude.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are other elements
that foster
it as well.

35:27.391 --> 35:31.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Internet creates an
environment where
there is less civility and
decorum.

35:31.929 --> 35:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the economics of the country
and the uneasiness
about the country put people on
edge.

35:36.701 --> 35:42.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, there is a climate
that's different,
and that I think it's fair to
say the administration

35:42.440 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has contributed to it.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Howie, a different
climate, with
the administration contributing
to it, what

35:46.911 --> 35:48.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you think?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD KURTZ, FOX News: Well,
there's no question
that President Trump has
escalated his rhetoric

35:51.949 --> 35:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a degree we have never seen
against the
press.

35:53.784 --> 35:58.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think it is a real
mistake, and we have
to be awfully careful here, to
conflate what

35:58.923 --> 36:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he says, using words, attacking
the press,
which a lot of his base likes,
and, in some

36:04.562 --> 36:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases, the press deserves -- and
we can get
into that in a moment -- and,
you know, this

36:08.833 --> 36:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
congressional candidate in
Montana doing something
that's completely unacceptable
and, by the

36:14.972 --> 36:19.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, politically stupid on the
eve of the
election, to physically assault
a reporter

36:19.110 --> 36:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who maybe stuck a type of tape
recorder in
his face.

36:21.579 --> 36:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think -- I used to say
this during the
Obama administration when a
police officer

36:26.150 --> 36:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be shot and some on the
right would
say, well, it's President
Obama's fault because

36:29.420 --> 36:31.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the way he talks about the
police.

36:31.122 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This kind of guilt by
association, I think
we have to be awfully careful
about.

36:34.258 --> 36:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tom, what about that,
that you
heard in the tape spot Nancy
Pelosi comparing

36:40.865 --> 36:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this candidate to President
Trump?

36:43.968 --> 36:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Howie says that the rhetoric
really doesn't
-- he can't directly relate the
rhetoric to

36:49.140 --> 36:50.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the actions.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

36:51.976 --> 36:56.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM ROSENSTIEL: Well, I think
that it's unfair
to say -- to compare what the
reporter did

36:56.414 --> 36:59.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to anything that President Trump
has done.

36:59.350 --> 37:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think to say that words
don't have implications
when you're the president, you
know, that's

37:05.223 --> 37:07.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably letting the president
off too easily.

37:07.758 --> 37:11.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this rhetoric is intense.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a trend.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not seeing, you know,
dozens of reporters
being beaten up.

37:16.434 --> 37:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there may be more attention
to it than
there has been in the past.

37:20.371 --> 37:27.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is important to recognize
that the
democracy depends on reporters
asking people

37:27.445 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in power questions, so that the
general public
has information.

37:31.415 --> 37:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't really self-govern
unless information
is widespread.

37:35.486 --> 37:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, reporters have
to be a little
aggressive.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you know, the reporter
didn't beat
up the politician.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The politician beat up the
reporter.

37:43.961 --> 37:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Howie, you were
saying that
some of these -- some of the
things are self-inflicted

37:48.633 --> 37:50.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the press?

37:50.501 --> 37:57.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD KURTZ: You know, I have
never seen
the level of anger and
frustration and resentment

37:57.275 --> 38:00.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and even disgust among millions
of Americans
toward the media.

38:00.544 --> 38:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there are a lot of
self-inflicted
wounds here, big mistakes that
are not learned

38:05.116 --> 38:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from, but also a lot of it the
byproduct of
a campaign in which the press
appeared to

38:10.087 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be out of touch with the
frustration of the
many millions of Americans who
helped put

38:13.691 --> 38:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump into the White
House and just
the way we botched it.

38:18.429 --> 38:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody woke up on Election
Day and thought
Hillary Clinton was going to be
the next president.

38:22.166 --> 38:27.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is one thing, of
course, for people
who don't like the media to vent
that on Twitter

38:27.305 --> 38:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or social media or even in
conversations.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And another thing -- and we have
to draw a
line between that and the kind
of physical

38:33.944 --> 38:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks that should never be
condoned by anybody.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans ought to speak
out against
what Gianforte did.

38:38.516 --> 38:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But talk about -- you
say that
there are mistakes that the
press hasn't learned

38:43.120 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you mean by that?

38:45.956 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD KURTZ: Well, you can look
at everything
from the -- what turned out to
be the phony

38:49.660 --> 38:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and retracted allegations of
rape in the "Rolling
Stone" case.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been a lot of that.

38:55.366 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, there have been
stories in campaigns
where the press has just gone
too far, been

39:00.571 --> 39:02.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slow to retract, slow to
acknowledge mistakes.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think all of that is a
problem.

39:04.675 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, by the way, while I
certainly don't defend
Donald Trump saying -- calling
journalists

39:08.412 --> 39:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the enemy of the American people
-- he says
that certain quote, fake news
organizations

39:11.982 --> 39:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- this is not a one-way street.

39:14.251 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been an incredible
level of vitriol
directed at the president,
mostly by commentators

39:18.589 --> 39:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and others, calling him names,
everything
from jokes on late-night
television, to just

39:24.028 --> 39:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political commentators calling
him a moron,
an idiot, a racist.

39:27.998 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of people who at least
are favorably
disposed toward this president
resent that.

39:31.769 --> 39:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tom, what do you --
answer, respond
to that.

39:35.539 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM ROSENSTIEL: Trust in the
press has been
declining for a couple of
decades.

39:39.343 --> 39:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's associated with actually
technology
expanding out.

39:42.947 --> 39:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started in the '80s, when we
began to see
cable and our TV dial went from
four to 40

39:47.785 --> 39:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to now 400, and then talk radio,
with the
deregulation of the airwaves.

39:53.424 --> 39:59.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have these organizations
or you have
media outlets marketing
themselves as the

39:59.697 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alternative to.

40:01.532 --> 40:06.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think the rhetoric
toward President
Trump from media sources or
media commentators

40:06.303 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is any worse than what Franklin
Roosevelt
got from a conservative press in
another era.

40:13.110 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Roosevelt was, you know, not
as blunt
as Trump about the press, but,
you know, there

40:20.584 --> 40:25.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an ideological press back
then, when we
had multiple newspapers in town.

40:25.689 --> 40:32.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would say, on balance,
frankly, the mainstream
press, which is decried often by
conservative

40:32.096 --> 40:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as liberal, is more professional
and more
accurate and faster to correct
mistakes than

40:37.768 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably it was in an earlier
era.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD KURTZ: But the mainstream
press...

40:41.806 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM ROSENSTIEL: But there's a --
it's an economic
imperative, if you're
conservative media,

40:45.609 --> 40:50.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to ideologically tar the
mainstream press
as a way of getting audience.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is a commercial
imperative for...

40:52.082 --> 40:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Very quickly, Howie.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're almost out of time.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD KURTZ: OK.

40:55.719 --> 40:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People on the left, a lot of
people on the
left don't like the press
either.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just a conservative vs.
liberal sort
of thing.

40:59.056 --> 41:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the same time, I have
heard commentators
say that President Trump should
be removed

41:02.293 --> 41:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the 25th Amendment.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of this is pretty harsh
stuff.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's got to be the
last word.

41:06.730 --> 41:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Howie Kurtz, Tom Rosenstiel,

JUDY WOODRUFF: There are still
very few companies
run by women these days.

41:21.879 --> 41:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, clearly, there are many
reasons for that,
including what many see as the
role of both

41:26.450 --> 41:29.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unconscious bias and outright
sexism.

41:29.687 --> 41:35.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, our economics
correspondent, Paul
Solman, explores another
potential connection:

41:35.493 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether there's a link between
risk-taking
in leadership, testosterone and
the perceptions

41:40.931 --> 41:42.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around gender.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing weekly
series, Making
Sense, which airs every
Thursday.

MAN: Welcome, everybody, to this
CNBC discussion
on the future of banking at the
World Economic

Forum.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Financial CEOs at
Davos this
year.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, Dow
Chemical: Good morning.

41:58.115 --> 41:59.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. President.

41:59.116 --> 42:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Manufacturing CEOs
at the White
House.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK FIELDS, CEO, Ford Motor
Company: CEO
of Ford.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS OBERHELMAN, CEO,
Caterpillar: Chairman
of Caterpillar.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Some of the great people in the
world of business.

42:07.057 --> 42:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: CEOs now being
mentioned as the
next president.

42:11.161 --> 42:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in 2017, the vast majority
of CEOs, 96
percent of the Fortune 500, are
still men.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER LERNER, Harvard
University: I think
that this is socially
constructed.

42:22.039 --> 42:29.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The differences between males
and females
on a wide variety of things are
smaller than

42:29.480 --> 42:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the differences within males and
within females.

42:31.615 --> 42:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Psychologist
Jennifer Lerner
studies gender and leadership at
Harvard.

42:35.953 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will hear more from her in a
bit.

42:38.155 --> 42:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, let's check in with
economist
Andy Kim, who has made a career
out of studying

42:43.460 --> 42:46.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CEOs in intriguingly quirky
ways.

42:46.764 --> 42:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM, Finance Professor: So,
you're gripping
this horse, right?

42:48.332 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, the reins.

42:50.067 --> 42:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, a few of you might remember
Andy Kim
teaching me two years ago the
equestrian dance

42:54.905 --> 43:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move in the hyper-viral video
sensation "Gangnam
Style," part of his offbeat
research showing

43:02.079 --> 43:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that CEOs who become visible,
for whatever
reason, can see their stock
price rise irrationally.

43:08.352 --> 43:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, he presented his brand-new
research,
not yet published, at this
year's annual Economics

43:15.192 --> 43:16.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Convention.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His latest hypothesis is as
offbeat as ever.

43:19.196 --> 43:24.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY KIM: There is a strong
linkage between
your facial masculinity and your
risk-taking

43:24.868 --> 43:26.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

43:26.670 --> 43:30.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kim is now
exploring a possible
link between CEO risk-taking and
the hormone

43:30.941 --> 43:36.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testosterone, which, starting
with mid-19th
century experiments on roosters,
has been

43:36.914 --> 43:41.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
linked to male dominance and
aggression throughout
the animal kingdom.

43:41.452 --> 43:48.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But how do you measure
testosterone in CEOs
with little time and probably
even less inclination

43:48.592 --> 43:53.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give Korean assistant finance
professors
blood or saliva samples?

43:53.631 --> 43:58.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One possible way, thought Kim,
would be to
study their facial bone
structure.

43:58.202 --> 44:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM: So, this is Mike
Tyson's face, obviously
a high-testosterone guy.

44:02.640 --> 44:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And not just
because he was a
notoriously aggressive
heavyweight champion,

44:07.177 --> 44:12.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claims Kim, but because of the
ratio of his
facial width.

44:12.282 --> 44:16.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Measure the distance
between your
cheekbones, where your ears are
attached to

44:16.720 --> 44:17.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your skull.

44:17.721 --> 44:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To his facial
height.

44:20.057 --> 44:25.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY KIM: From the point where
your skull
is linked to your teeth to the
point between

44:25.562 --> 44:26.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your eyebrows.

44:26.563 --> 44:28.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's the ridge
here?

44:28.365 --> 44:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM: It goes together with
your eye hole
in your skull, right.

44:32.903 --> 44:38.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, the science
here is far
from settled, but facial
width-to-height ratio,

44:38.876 --> 44:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a skull measurement technique
developed by
archaeologists, has been
proposed as a proxy

44:44.381 --> 44:49.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for masculinity, on the theory
that it's influenced
by exposure to testosterone.

44:49.586 --> 44:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM: The idea is, more
masculine, wider
face.

44:52.189 --> 44:57.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The typical ratio
in men, Kim
has found, 1.8.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And mine?

44:58.195 --> 45:00.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Yours was 1.83, which
is..

45:00.264 --> 45:04.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Just average, and
exactly the
same as Justin Bieber's, by the
way.

45:04.134 --> 45:07.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Muy macho Mike Tyson, 2.28.

45:08.005 --> 45:11.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not far behind, at 2.17, Jack
Ma.

45:11.275 --> 45:12.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
According to Kim...

45:12.276 --> 45:14.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Very high-testosterone
CEO.

45:14.278 --> 45:20.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And a very
successful one, as
founder of Alibaba, the Chinese
e-commerce

45:20.284 --> 45:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
firm bigger than Amazon and eBay
combined.

45:24.354 --> 45:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim thinks a man's facial
width-to-height
ratio does correlate with
testosterone, but,

45:31.128 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if it doesn't, he has a
provocative finding:
that the average score for 1,162
CEOs, measured

45:39.703 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by neutral third parties, was a
significantly
higher-than-average 2.0.

45:46.243 --> 45:52.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even more striking, the wider
the face, the
higher the correlation with
risk-taking.

45:52.483 --> 46:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your hypothesis was, the more
masculine, as
revealed by facial
width-to-height ratio,

46:01.158 --> 46:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the more testosterone and,
therefore, the
CEO is going to take more risks
how?

46:05.896 --> 46:07.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Borrowing more.

46:07.431 --> 46:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Borrowing more
money.

46:08.899 --> 46:13.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Another part of it is
mergers and
acquisitions.

46:13.303 --> 46:16.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want to have higher social
status.

46:16.340 --> 46:19.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to take over your
competitor and
become a bigger guy.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And this turns out
to be true?

46:21.512 --> 46:24.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY KIM: Yes, that's what we
find in our
paper.

46:24.348 --> 46:32.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only does the guy more
frequently merge,
but he spends more money on
acquisition every

46:32.689 --> 46:34.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

46:34.525 --> 46:39.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And then there's
testosterone's
well-established connection to
vocal pitch,

46:39.429 --> 46:46.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at any given age, the lower the
pitch, the
higher the testosterone, a
relationship Andy

46:46.804 --> 46:48.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kim has also begun to study.

46:48.438 --> 46:50.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDY KIM: We look at vocal
masculinity.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Vocal?

46:51.375 --> 46:52.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANDY KIM: Yes.

46:52.676 --> 46:55.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is a low
voice, as opposed
to a high voice?

46:55.445 --> 46:56.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDY KIM: Exactly.

46:56.713 --> 47:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The more masculine guys, they
tend to be borrowing
more.

47:00.784 --> 47:01.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All consistent.

47:02.019 --> 47:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: There's a
systematic relationship
there.

47:04.221 --> 47:09.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all explained through
testosterone
as a kind of social dominance
hormone.

47:09.493 --> 47:13.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jennifer Lerner
doesn't study
facial width or vocal pitch.

47:13.931 --> 47:20.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, she measures
testosterone levels
directly of leaders enrolled in
advanced programs

47:20.337 --> 47:22.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the Kennedy School of
Government.

47:22.139 --> 47:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: We do it
through saliva,
and we have them drool, which
can be a little

47:25.876 --> 47:31.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit amusing, because we have,
you know, three-star
admirals and...

47:31.181 --> 47:33.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Drooling three-star
admirals.

47:33.116 --> 47:34.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:34.785 --> 47:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: It turns out
that highly
successful people love to be
studied.

47:38.255 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And one study of 78
men published
last year seems to support the
first part

47:44.394 --> 47:50.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Andy Kim's hypothesis, that
male leaders
have higher-than-average
testosterone.

47:50.767 --> 47:55.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When you take their
testosterone, does it
correlate with their rank?

47:55.706 --> 48:01.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: Yes, it does,
the more testosterone,
the more subordinates you have.

48:01.278 --> 48:05.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, this could
just be because
power begets testosterone,
rather than the

48:05.883 --> 48:07.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other way round.

48:07.651 --> 48:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it fits with the current
view that testosterone
encourages status-seeking in
men.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
How?

48:15.659 --> 48:21.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mainly by decreasing fear and
triggering anger,
says Lerner, both of which
increase risk-taking.

48:21.498 --> 48:26.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: Fear and anger
have opposite
effects when it comes to risk.

48:26.136 --> 48:34.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that men are more likely
to experience
anger and to take more risks as
a result of

48:34.878 --> 48:36.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that anger.

48:36.280 --> 48:41.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, angry
investment managers,
angry CEOs do better?

48:41.818 --> 48:48.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: We human beings
are risk-averse
and just kind of, on average,
leave some money

48:48.659 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the table in investment
situations.

48:50.694 --> 48:52.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

48:52.362 --> 48:58.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: So, to the
extent that risk-taking
is going to lead to benefits...

48:58.568 --> 49:01.838 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: The
testosterone-enriched are
at an advantage.

49:01.872 --> 49:06.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: The male who is
angry is
going to really thrive in that
environment.

49:06.610 --> 49:11.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, if testosterone
can help
explain which men rise to the
top, does it

49:11.581 --> 49:14.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also explain why it's so often
men, instead
of women?

49:14.818 --> 49:16.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, says Lerner.

49:16.653 --> 49:21.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: It's certainly
not inevitable,
because there are places where
you can see

49:21.558 --> 49:25.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
progress in society, but it is
extremely rare.

49:25.529 --> 49:32.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of that is the gender
stereotypes
of what we hold in our minds.

49:32.135 --> 49:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An angry woman is called a
bitch.

49:35.105 --> 49:37.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
An angry man is called powerful.

49:37.274 --> 49:43.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, it does sound
as if the deck
is stacked against women
ascending to the

49:43.647 --> 49:45.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
top of organizations, no?

49:45.482 --> 49:50.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LERNER: It depends, I
think, on what
the patterns of ascension are
going to be.

49:50.053 --> 49:56.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To the extent that leadership
can arise through
building networks, through
building coalitions,

49:56.960 --> 49:58.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a path to the top.

49:58.895 --> 50:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And maybe, in a
corporate age
of network- and
coalition-building, the
so-called

50:04.501 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advantages of being seen as
masculine will
eventually fade.

50:12.175 --> 50:16.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, the chickens came
home to roost
after the financial crisis of
'08.

50:16.747 --> 50:23.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If and when there's another, you
have to wonder
if risk-happy fellows will still
rule the

50:23.120 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roost.

50:24.554 --> 50:32.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
economics correspondent
Paul Solman reporting.

50:32.162 --> 50:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series.

50:44.441 --> 50:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Sebastian
Thrun.

50:47.277 --> 50:54.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's an adjunct professor at
Stanford University
and the founder of Udacity, an
online educational

50:54.384 --> 50:56.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

50:56.186 --> 51:00.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He founded Google X, the
semi-secret research
facility that began development
of Google's

51:00.490 --> 51:02.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
self-driving car.

51:02.359 --> 51:05.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN THRUN, Founder,
Udacity: Artificial
intelligence is to the human
brain what the

51:06.029 --> 51:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
steam engine has been to the
human muscle.

51:09.199 --> 51:14.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Before the agricultural
revolution, most of
us were farmers, and our
distinguishing capabilities

51:14.671 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were our physical strength and
agility.

51:17.140 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we invented machines
that make us
stronger and, all of a sudden,
one farmer

51:20.777 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can make food for 150 people.

51:22.512 --> 51:28.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this has unleashed a flurry
of amazing
innovations, like airplanes,
cell phones,

51:28.285 --> 51:34.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs you never heard of like
software engineer
or TV anchor, all these
wonderful things.

51:34.558 --> 51:36.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is about to change once
again.

51:36.860 --> 51:44.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
I
think we're going to look back
and find that

51:44.434 --> 51:48.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
driving a car is just like the
same way the
Middle Ages look from today's
perspective.

51:48.605 --> 51:54.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We kill over a million people
every year in
this world using traffic
accidents.

51:54.044 --> 51:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's an intolerably high
number.

51:55.879 --> 51:59.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We text, we make phone calls,
we're fatigued,
we're sometimes even drunk when
driving and

51:59.416 --> 52:01.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all this stuff.

52:01.084 --> 52:04.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A self-driving car doesn't text,
it doesn't
fatigue, it looks in all
directions, it's

52:04.921 --> 52:09.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never drunk, and it emerges as a
safe alternative
to human driving.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have a 9-year-old.

52:10.894 --> 52:13.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would love to put him in a
driverless car
and say, go to school on your
own.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would love it, because it
would give
him the ability to go around and
organize

52:16.500 --> 52:18.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his own play dates.

52:18.201 --> 52:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think every technology comes
with its risks
and with its possibility for
abuse.

52:22.172 --> 52:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can take a kitchen
knife, and
you can cut your food, or you
can kill somebody

52:28.178 --> 52:29.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or hurt somebody with the same
knife.

52:29.846 --> 52:32.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the same is true for every
technology
we invent.

52:32.415 --> 52:37.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think what's important is
that we approach
these technologies with
responsibility.

52:38.021 --> 52:41.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The next generation of
technology is going
to be called artificial
intelligence.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to have an I.Q.
of 10,000.

52:42.959 --> 52:46.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be able to solve
every problem
and know everything there is to
know just

52:46.530 --> 52:48.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by using A.I.

52:48.431 --> 52:52.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My students and I recently did
work on artificial
intelligence for detecting skin
cancer, and

52:52.903 --> 52:59.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found that if we train an
artificial intelligence
with about 130,000 images, we
can find skin

52:59.776 --> 53:05.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer basically using an iPhone
as accurately
as the best board-certified
dermatologist.

53:05.048 --> 53:10.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's sensational, because
now we can
take the skill of a Stanford
doctor and bring

53:10.453 --> 53:15.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that skill to the entire world
by a platform
that everybody already has,
which is a smartphone.

53:15.225 --> 53:18.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time I talk through my
phone -- and
it's probably about an hour a
day -- it could

53:18.962 --> 53:24.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analyze my speech and thereby
find things
like Alzheimer's much, much,
much earlier

53:24.734 --> 53:26.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than we find it today.

53:26.603 --> 53:31.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exciting, because it
would mean
we would be able to cure and
treat those diseases

53:31.074 --> 53:33.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a stage when they're often
still curable.

53:33.944 --> 53:37.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you, when I started
working on
self-driving cars more than 10
years ago,

53:37.447 --> 53:42.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of my professor colleagues
told me it's
impossible and I'm wasting my
time and possibly

53:42.118 --> 53:43.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my career.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at the Wright
brothers, 100
years ago, the world's experts
had come together

53:46.923 --> 53:51.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and concluded that it's
impossible, there
will not be such a thing as
flight.

53:51.127 --> 53:54.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when you go forward, why
can't we cure
all of cancer?

53:54.397 --> 53:57.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can't we cure heart failure
and heart
diseases?

53:57.867 --> 53:59.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And why can't cars fly in the
future?

53:59.803 --> 54:01.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do they have to be on the
ground?

54:01.705 --> 54:05.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, all these things, when
you think through
it, the answer might be very
different from

54:05.508 --> 54:07.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what the past tells us.

54:07.310 --> 54:11.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Sebastian Thrun, and
this is my
Brief, But hopefully Spectacular
take on imaging

54:11.281 --> 54:12.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the future.

54:12.882 --> 54:16.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sebastian Thrun.

54:16.453 --> 54:18.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a quick news update before
we go tonight.

54:18.955 --> 54:23.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both NBC News and The Washington
Post are
reporting that the president's
son-in-law

54:23.727 --> 54:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner has come under
scrutiny by the
FBI in its investigation into
Russian meddling

54:30.066 --> 54:31.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the election.

54:31.868 --> 54:35.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators believe that
Kushner, one of
the president's top advisers,
has significant

54:35.905 --> 54:38.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information related to their
probe.

54:38.308 --> 54:42.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kushner has not been accused of
any wrongdoing.

54:42.245 --> 54:43.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:43.980 --> 54:49.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, my interview with Aya
Hijazi on
her imprisonment in Egypt, and a
review of

54:49.519 --> 54:53.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump's overseas trip
with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

54:53.990 --> 54:55.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:55.492 --> 55:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
