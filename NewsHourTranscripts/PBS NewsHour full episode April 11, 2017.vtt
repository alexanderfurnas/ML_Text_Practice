JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.805 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.575 --> 00:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: They
have aligned themselves with an
unreliable

00:10.577 --> 00:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
partner in Bashar al-Assad.

00:12.479 --> 00:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson
talks tough, warning Russia
about backing

00:16.816 --> 00:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Assad regime in the wake of
chemical weapons
attacks.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:22.455 --> 00:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: For
those that continue to seek
improper and illegal

00:25.759 --> 00:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entry into this country, be
forewarned.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new era.

00:31.197 --> 00:36.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Attorney
General Jeff Sessions
tours the U.S.-Mexico border, we
head to Mexico

00:37.003 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
City, where the recently
deported struggle
to survive in unfamiliar
surroundings.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FELIZIO GONZALES, Recently
Deported (through
translator): I had a girlfriend
I was living

00:44.411 --> 00:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with, but now it's all over.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She stayed there, and I came
back to Mexico.

00:49.315 --> 00:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a forgotten
generation.

00:52.052 --> 00:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenges of educating
Syrian children
in the middle of war.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.863 --> 01:06.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.666 --> 01:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
top diplomat
is now in Russia at a moment of
high tension.

01:17.043 --> 01:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It centers on last week's U.S.
military strike
on Syria, after the regime
launched a chemical

01:22.916 --> 01:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons attack against its own
people.

01:25.518 --> 01:29.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports on this day's
events.

01:30.023 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson
arrived in Moscow this evening
on the heels

01:36.129 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of some tough talk about Syria
at the Group
of 7 meeting in Italy.

01:40.133 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Russia
has really aligned itself with
the Assad regime,

01:46.506 --> 01:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Iranians and Hezbollah.

01:50.243 --> 01:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that a long-term alliance
that serves Russia's
interest?

01:55.849 --> 02:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or would Russia prefer to
realign with the
United States, with other
Western countries

02:03.857 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Middle East countries who
are seeking
to resolve the Syrian crisis?

02:07.827 --> 02:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: U.S.-Russian
tensions surged
after last Tuesday's chemical
attack, which

02:12.365 --> 02:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed more than 80 people in
Syria's rebel-held
Idlib province.

02:15.735 --> 02:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. responded with cruise
missile strikes
on a Syrian air base Thursday.

02:22.876 --> 02:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson again today faulted
Russia for failing
to enforce a deal it helped
negotiate in 2013

02:29.716 --> 02:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rid Syria of all chemical
weapons.

02:33.253 --> 02:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In their communique today, the
G7 ministers
said they were shocked and
horrified by the

02:38.691 --> 02:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack, but they decided against
further actions
for now.

02:42.896 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking in Moscow, Russian
President Vladimir
Putin likened the allegations
about Syria

02:48.568 --> 02:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to false U.S. claims in 2003
that Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he expects more such
incidents.

02:56.876 --> 03:00.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): We have
intelligence from various

03:00.513 --> 03:05.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sources that similar
provocations are being
prepared in other regions of
Syria, including

03:05.285 --> 03:09.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the southern suburbs of
Damascus, where they
are planning to plant chemicals
and blame

03:09.355 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian government for using
them.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Hours later,
White House
officials accused Moscow of
attempting to

03:15.061 --> 03:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cover up Syria's culpability
with -- quote
-- "false narratives."

03:19.365 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said satellite and open
source imagery
establishes Syria was
responsible, and disproves

03:25.638 --> 03:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's claims that the gas was
released
by a government strike on a
rebel depot.

03:31.411 --> 03:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A senior U.S. official had said
Monday there's
evidence Russia knew ahead of
time about the

03:36.282 --> 03:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chemical attack, but White House
Press Secretary
Sean Spicer walked that back
today.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
There's no consensus within the
intelligence

03:43.389 --> 03:45.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community that there was
involvement.

03:45.225 --> 03:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: At the same
time, Spicer's
own words proved a distraction
for the White

03:49.395 --> 03:50.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: We didn't use
chemical weapons
in World War II.

03:52.832 --> 03:59.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you had a -- you know,
someone as
despicable of Hitler who didn't
even sink

03:59.339 --> 04:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the -- to using chemical
weapons.

04:02.108 --> 04:06.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: When
challenged, he acknowledged
that Hitler gassed millions of
Jews and others

04:06.846 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in death camps.

04:08.581 --> 04:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Spicer later clarified his
remarks in
a statement, saying he was in no
way trying

04:13.686 --> 04:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to minimize the Holocaust.

04:15.755 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, at the Pentagon,
Defense Secretary
James Mattis and Central
Command's top general,

04:21.694 --> 04:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joseph Votel, reiterated that
the U.S. focus
would be the fight against ISIS.

04:27.967 --> 04:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattis was asked why the U.S.
acted after
the chemical attack, but not
after conventional

04:33.406 --> 04:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strikes that kill Syrian
civilians.

04:35.441 --> 04:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: There
is a limit, I think, to what we
can do.

04:41.714 --> 04:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We knew that we could not stand
passive on
this, but it was not a statement
that we could

04:48.588 --> 04:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enter full-fledged, full-bore
into the most
complex civil war probably
raging on the planet.

04:56.863 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

05:00.066 --> 05:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, North
Korea issued a fiery new warning
to the United

05:05.571 --> 05:07.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

05:07.507 --> 05:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State TV threatened nuclear
strikes on American
military bases in South Korea
and elsewhere,

05:12.478 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the U.S. makes any aggressive
move.

05:15.181 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report noted that a U.S.
aircraft carrier
group is moving toward the
region for military

05:20.653 --> 05:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exercises with the South.

05:22.622 --> 05:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
United States'
dispatching of its nuclear
carrier task group

05:28.161 --> 05:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the waters off the peninsula
proves that
its reckless moves for invading
North Korea

05:32.899 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have reached a serious phase.

05:35.468 --> 05:40.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the U.S. dares opt for
military action,
then North Korea is ready to
react to any

05:40.273 --> 05:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mode of war desired by the U.S.

05:42.775 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
President Trump
used Twitter to send his own
warning to Pyongyang

05:47.947 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to China.

05:49.315 --> 05:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweeted -- quote -- "North
Korea is looking
for trouble.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If China decides to help, that
would be great.

05:55.888 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not, we will solve the
problem without
them."

05:59.892 --> 06:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats were hoping for an
upset today in
the first congressional election
since President

06:04.864 --> 06:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's November victory.

06:06.632 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a race to fill the Kansas
seat vacated
when Representative Mike Pompeo
was named

06:12.238 --> 06:14.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
director of the CIA.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat James Thompson is
challenging Republican
Ron Estes.

06:18.911 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president tweeted his
support for Estes
today.

06:22.815 --> 06:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Texas must decide
how to proceed
after a federal judge ruled for
a second time

06:29.222 --> 06:32.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that a voter I.D. law
discriminates against
minorities.

06:32.992 --> 06:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a previous ruling, the judge
likened the
law to a poll tax.

06:37.029 --> 06:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appeals court asked
her to reexamine
the case, which she did, before
reaffirming

06:42.535 --> 06:44.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her finding on Monday.

06:44.404 --> 06:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A separate court has found that
Texas racially
gerrymandered several
congressional districts.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, stocks
struggled to
make any headway.

06:54.781 --> 07:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gave up six
points to close at 20651.

07:00.787 --> 07:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 14 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped three.

07:05.725 --> 07:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Thailand, they have begun
festivities
to ring in the Buddhist new
year, starting

07:10.696 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with elephants spraying people
with water.

07:13.566 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The animals marched through the
country's
ancient capital today, dousing
revelers and

07:18.838 --> 07:20.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tourists alike.

07:20.640 --> 07:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tradition is said to wash
away bad luck
and usher in prosperity for the
new year.

07:27.146 --> 07:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what happens
to the undocumented immigrants
after deportation;

07:32.985 --> 07:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why doctors now say men should
get screened
for prostate cancer;
corporations vs. consumers,

07:40.126 --> 07:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how airline ticket rules led to
this paying
customer being forced off a
United Airlines

07:46.332 --> 07:59.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
flight; and much more.

07:59.812 --> 08:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
today outlined
the Trump administration's tough
approach

08:04.150 --> 08:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on immigration during a visit to
the U.S.-Mexico
border in Nogales, Arizona.

08:09.789 --> 08:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He credited President Trump with
the decline
in border apprehensions and he
urged federal

08:15.027 --> 08:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prosecutors to focus on
smugglers and immigrants
who reenter the U.S. after
deportation.

08:20.633 --> 08:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: For
those that continue to seek
improper and illegal

08:25.638 --> 08:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entry into this country, be
forewarned.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new era.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is the Trump era.

08:33.513 --> 08:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lawlessness, the abdication
of the duty
to enforce our laws and the
catch-and-release

08:39.118 --> 08:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policies of the past are over.

08:42.522 --> 08:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more on
all of this,
we are joined from Tucson by
Nancy Montoya.

08:50.196 --> 08:55.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's senior reporter on
immigration and border
issues for Arizona Public Media.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nancy Montoya, welcome back to
the program.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been covering border
issues for many
years.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What struck you the most about
what the attorney
general had to say today?

09:03.409 --> 09:08.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA, Arizona Public
Media: I think
it was more what he didn't say,
Judy.

09:08.514 --> 09:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that has been
happening
on a regular basis with the
Trump administration

09:13.019 --> 09:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, officials come into the
border, they spend
a couple of hours, they talk to
CBP, which

09:18.958 --> 09:24.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is Customs and Border
Protection, they talk
to Border Patrol, they talk to
officials,

09:24.330 --> 09:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they never talk to community
members,
to some of the civil rights
groups, to some

09:28.834 --> 09:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the human rights groups who
have really
been protesting a lot of the
strategies and

09:34.440 --> 09:36.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies of the Trump
administration.

09:36.676 --> 09:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that was one of the things
that really
caught me off-guard, is that
there was no

09:41.747 --> 09:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation with those on the
other side
of the controversy.

09:46.218 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you
hearing from this
administration that differs from
Obama administration

09:51.290 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy?

09:53.025 --> 10:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: I think it is the
types of
people who they are targeting
for deportation.

10:00.299 --> 10:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the Obama administration,
yes, it was
true he was dubbed the deporter
in chief for

10:05.504 --> 10:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deporting more people than the
past three
administrations put together,
but there was

10:11.077 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also a targeted group they were
deporting,
Obama administration was
deporting.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those were people with
felonies.

10:18.784 --> 10:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were people who were
involved in drug
trafficking, dangerous people,
people who

10:24.690 --> 10:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had committed murder or assault.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those were the people who were
being targeted.

10:29.895 --> 10:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's different here is that
you are now
considered illegal if you cross
the border

10:37.570 --> 10:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once, and you're considered to
have broken
the law.

10:41.407 --> 10:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, one time will get you a
possible prosecution.

10:46.979 --> 10:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two times where you're caught
crossing the
border illegally will get you a
felony.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's one of the biggest
differences.

10:54.687 --> 11:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, anybody who is caught up
in a net in
any kind of a raid are eligible
for deportation

11:02.428 --> 11:04.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immediately.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there was
also -- we noticed
the march today seemed to be
addressed to

11:07.967 --> 11:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parents of children, parents who
had come
across the border, had children
born in the

11:13.239 --> 11:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S., but the vulnerability that
those parents
still find themselves in.

11:17.743 --> 11:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: Yes, that was
also one of the
things that struck me as
difficult to hear,

11:25.051 --> 11:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as someone who has lived and
worked along
the border for 30 years, is
that, in many

11:29.955 --> 11:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, you have people have
crossed the border
20, 30 years ago.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They had their children here.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have grandchildren.

11:39.598 --> 11:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now they, too, if they are
not citizens
and didn't cross into this
country legally,

11:44.970 --> 11:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they are subject to deportation.

11:47.239 --> 11:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has already happened,
where U.S.-born
children are being separated
from their parents.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Parents are being deported.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no safety net anymore.

11:58.184 --> 12:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you are -- if you are here
and you cross
the border illegally, the Trump
administration

12:04.290 --> 12:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is putting you on warning that
you could be
next.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things
the attorney
general, Nancy Montoya, referred
to was the

12:11.030 --> 12:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration's plan to hire, I
think he
said 50 more immigration judges
this year,

12:16.202 --> 12:18.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
75 more next year.

12:18.070 --> 12:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of a difference could
that make in
the processing of immigration
cases?

12:24.110 --> 12:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: That's very
unclear.

12:27.012 --> 12:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's actually two things
to consider
here.

12:30.216 --> 12:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the backlog with
immigration
court cases is about 500,000
people, half-a-million

12:38.758 --> 12:42.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people backlogged in the
immigration system.

12:42.695 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unclear whether these 25 to
50 to 75
new judges will be handling only
the new cases

12:51.003 --> 12:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming in, or will they be
spread out throughout
the entire system?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's still unclear.

12:58.110 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is also a lot of worry
that you won't
get these judges up to speed.

13:03.549 --> 13:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that Attorney General
Sessions said
we're going to streamline the
process, we're

13:08.521 --> 13:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to push people through,
but it still
takes up to a year to get a new
judge in place.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we still have no evidence
that streamlining
is going to mean faster.

13:20.032 --> 13:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the meantime, you will be
arresting
more people and putting more
people into the

13:26.338 --> 13:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, more people into private
prisons and
some of the public prisons, and
further overloading

13:32.444 --> 13:36.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an already overwhelmed
immigration court system.

13:36.916 --> 13:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just in a
couple seconds,
the status of the border wall
that we have

13:41.086 --> 13:42.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heard so much about?

13:42.521 --> 13:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: Border wall, no
go.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mexico will not pay for it.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Congress needs to
appropriate the money.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, they don't appear to be
willing to
do that.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
certainly see
about it.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy Montoya with Arizona
Public Media, thank
you.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: Thank you, Judy.

14:00.406 --> 14:06.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, part of what
the attorney
general called the Trump era
includes speeding

14:06.145 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up the deportation process, but
what happens
to those who are deported?

14:11.083 --> 14:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin traveled
to Mexico to try to answer that
question.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He begins in Mexico City.

14:16.922 --> 14:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Mexico City's
airport, the
recently deported arrive by the
planeload.

14:21.660 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the country of their
birth, but most
have been gone so long, it feels
foreign.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FELIZIO GONZALES, Recently
Deported (through
translator): You come back here
knowing nothing

14:29.134 --> 14:30.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about your future.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.672 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Fifty-two-year-old Felizio
Gonzales was arrested last year
in Seattle

14:33.706 --> 14:35.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for running a stop sign.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been living in the U.S. as
an undocumented
immigrant installing carpets for
the last

14:39.712 --> 14:41.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 years.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FELIZIO GONZALES (through
translator): I had
a girlfriend I was living with,
but now it's

14:44.383 --> 14:45.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all over.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She stayed there, and I came
back to Mexico.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Gonzales and
every deportee
arriving from the U.S. is
greeted by city

14:51.523 --> 14:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government workers and local aid
groups.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUDY LOPEZ, Immigration
Activist: When you're
coming here, you're coming
broken.

14:56.028 --> 15:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Rudy Lopez leads
an organization
that provides basic immediate
assistance.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He says he feels recent
arrivals' pain.

15:03.135 --> 15:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was deported for traffic
tickets and getting
in a fight a year-and-a-half
ago.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His two American children still
live in Las
Vegas.

15:09.508 --> 15:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUDY LOPEZ: I fight because I
don't like families
being destroyed, you know?

15:14.013 --> 15:15.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I miss my boy.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I miss my daughter.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Is the government
helping recent
deportees?

15:20.386 --> 15:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUDY LOPEZ: Really, really, it's
a little
bit, the help.

15:23.589 --> 15:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our government is -- I'm sorry
for the word
-- it's (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

15:29.228 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexico got a lot of money, but
not for everybody,
only for the government.

15:33.966 --> 15:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today, Lopez is
the deportees'
only source of help.

15:38.437 --> 15:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He hands Gonzales a little
spending cash and
leads him outside the airport.

15:43.442 --> 15:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gonzales carries only what U.S.
immigration
allowed him to take: a mesh bag,
the clothes

15:47.780 --> 15:48.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his back.

15:49.014 --> 15:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They lead him into Mexico City's
sprawling
metro system.

15:53.052 --> 15:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gonzales is almost immediately
lost.

15:59.591 --> 16:00.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He gets off the metro.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He hopes it's the right stop.

16:04.930 --> 16:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He looks for a bus to take him
an hour out
of town to his ex-wife's House,
but he hasn't

16:09.068 --> 16:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talked to her in four years.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He decides that she's a long
shot, and there
is only one remaining sanctuary.

16:15.908 --> 16:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FELIZIO GONZALES (through
translator): All
I can do is ask God to make it a
little easier.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why can't you
help these people
more?

16:23.082 --> 16:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS SADA SOLANA, Mexican
Deputy Foreign
Minister: It's a huge challenge,
I would say.

16:26.719 --> 16:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Carlos Sada
Solana is Mexico's
deputy foreign minister.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He admits the government is
overwhelmed by
the recent arrivals.

16:33.258 --> 16:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS SADA SOLANA: We still
have to make
it better, so that people feel
really welcome

16:38.697 --> 16:45.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and protected by the
institutions of Mexico,
and also offering some
alternatives for jobs.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what we are trying
to improve.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Many people here
blame President
Trump.

16:50.743 --> 16:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his predecessor, President
Barack Obama,
was dubbed by his pro-immigrant
rights critics

16:55.214 --> 16:57.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the deporter-in-chief.

16:57.082 --> 17:01.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And according to Mexican
statistics, the Trump
administration deported slightly
fewer Mexicans

17:01.620 --> 17:05.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in February compared to last
year.

17:05.357 --> 17:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico says what has changed is
that the Trump
administration is moving
undocumented Mexicans

17:09.962 --> 17:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the deportation steps
faster, and
is deporting more undocumented
Mexicans from

17:14.566 --> 17:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cities far from the Mexican
border.

17:16.402 --> 17:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS SADA SOLANA: We are very
concerned,
because it has extended the
expedited removal,

17:21.473 --> 17:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only from the border area,
to the whole
territory of the United States,
including

17:26.812 --> 17:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alaska, and that this could
provoke also violations
of human rights, not giving the
due process

17:34.353 --> 17:36.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the people.

17:36.188 --> 17:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Eleven hundred
miles north,
on the Arizona-Mexico border,
the two towns

17:40.159 --> 17:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
divided by a fence are both
called Nogales.

17:43.762 --> 17:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deportees in Nogales,
Mexico, arrive from
the U.S. by the busload.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. and Mexico coordinates
their arrival.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have just a few days to
plan their next
steps.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE MESA, Recently Deported:
This is my first
day over here in Mexico.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel, like, weird, because I
don't know
nothing about over here.

17:58.210 --> 18:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the last 15
years, 29-year-old
Jose Mesa lived in Phoenix and
worked as a

18:02.548 --> 18:04.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
caregiver.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he was arrested for
driving under
the influence, and then
deported.

18:07.419 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a lot of fear in
immigrant communities
in the United States about
getting deported

18:12.424 --> 18:13.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOSE MESA: Yes.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, yes, they got a lot
of fear.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Because the
administration
doesn't want you?

18:17.129 --> 18:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE MESA: Yes, administration
of Trump is
getting more worse, yes.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He says, since
the inauguration,
immigration agents are more
aggressive, and

18:22.835 --> 18:24.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his neighbors are more
prejudiced.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSE MESA: They don't give you
respect.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they treat me like
trash.

18:27.773 --> 18:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nearby, the
deported find sanctuary
at the San Juan Bosco shelter.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has been housing recent
arrivals for
more than 30 years.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some will try and cross again.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But others are preparing to
travel south to
their homes in Mexico.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say the border has gotten
too difficult
to cross.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jorge Rivera Uribe is only 19.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His American dream was to
provide money for
his two sisters, his wife, his
daughter, and

18:50.829 --> 18:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his mother, who has diabetes.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA URIBE, Recently
Deported (through
translator): I don't have money
to take care

18:55.968 --> 18:57.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of them.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wanted to see if I could
earn more money
to give them all a better life,
so they don't

19:01.006 --> 19:02.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to suffer.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In the U.S., he
was building
homes, making in one day what it
takes a week

19:06.111 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make in Mexico.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the border is now much more
dangerous.

19:09.982 --> 19:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, he tried to sneak
into the U.S.
without paying the $500 charged
by local drug

19:14.253 --> 19:15.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cartels.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They almost beat him to death.

19:17.222 --> 19:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA URIBE (through
translator): They
told me, if they find me
crossing again, they

19:20.859 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will blow my head off.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't know I'm alive.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they did, they would have
come for me.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why I want to leave here.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I won't let them kill me.

19:29.134 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Uribe and the
others are allowed
to spend three nights here.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's comfortable, but they know
they need
to move on soon.

19:36.008 --> 19:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next morning, they wait to
be transported
to other locations that offer
help.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty-two-year-old Sergio
Guererro has four
American children in California.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's changed for you since
Donald Trump
was elected president?

19:48.987 --> 19:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO GUERERRO, Recently
Deported (through
translator): It's gotten more
difficult.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If you go nowadays, it's
scarier.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Their reticence
reflects a
recent trend.

19:57.329 --> 20:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Border Patrol says, in
March, compared
to last year, the number of
people apprehended

20:01.833 --> 20:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or turned away at the border
dropped by 64
percent.

20:05.504 --> 20:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Homeland Security Secretary John
Kelly takes
credit for that decrease, and
says the administration's

20:10.075 --> 20:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policies discourage would-be
crossers.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
What we're doing on the border,
what we intend

20:14.780 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do on the border has added to
that deterrent
effect.

20:17.382 --> 20:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But that has left
some of the
deported in no man's land, too
scared to try

20:21.353 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cross back to their American
lives, forsaken
by their birth country that
feels alien.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Martin Lopez is 48.

20:29.962 --> 20:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was born in Tijuana, but
spent 44 years
in California.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He worked in restaurants and
says he paid
taxes.

20:35.934 --> 20:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was deported three months ago
after he
says he took the rap for his
American wife's

20:39.972 --> 20:41.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
welfare fraud.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ, Recently Deported:
I had to,
because I didn't want my kids
taken away from

20:43.508 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He left Mexico
when he was
4, and doesn't have his birth
certificate.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He never got any American
documentation.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He feels like a John Doe.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's run out of money and hope.

20:53.352 --> 20:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ: It's difficult,
very difficult.

20:57.256 --> 21:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I never suffered this much like
I have in
a month, two months.

21:03.862 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it comes down to the
point where you
just don't want to live no more.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all it is.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very difficult.

21:15.007 --> 21:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have to survive, you know?

21:19.544 --> 21:26.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's not much to say.

21:26.685 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My kids hold me up.

21:27.886 --> 21:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: You talk to them?

21:28.987 --> 21:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ: Oh, yes, I talk to
them.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What do they tell
you?

21:32.190 --> 21:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ: Oh, they say just
not to lose
hope, not to lose hope, and hang
in there.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they're kids.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't -- there's not much
they can say.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: When he first
arrived, he could
sleep and eat in local shelters.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's a time limit on
their assistance.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, today, he's on his own.

21:48.307 --> 21:53.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tried to cross back into the
U.S., but
fell and hurt his back.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He too turns to God.

21:55.113 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He feels trapped between two
countries, neither
of which offers help.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ: Well, this is my
sleeping area.

22:00.419 --> 22:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is where I sleep ever since
I got deported.

22:06.058 --> 22:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I'm not working, I
mean, this is
where I'm at right here, as you
can see my

22:10.762 --> 22:11.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
blankets here.

22:11.763 --> 22:12.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not much of a comfort.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very sad, sleeping like
this.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You go through a lot of
thinking.

22:17.102 --> 22:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have that support where
I can pay
and get across.

22:22.974 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think, for the next
day, how am
I going to make it, how am I
going to live,

22:28.413 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what am I going to do?

22:29.781 --> 22:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Going to sleep with an empty
stomach, waking
up very sad.

22:36.054 --> 22:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He sleeps now
among the dead.

22:40.459 --> 22:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are his neighbors of
necessity, and,
from them, despite everything
he's been through,

22:45.530 --> 22:46.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he takes resilience.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LOPEZ: I will overcome
this.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have to.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no life here, no life.

22:51.336 --> 22:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Nogales,
Mexico.

23:00.011 --> 23:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Each year, 26,000
men in the
United States die from prostate
cancer.

23:10.122 --> 23:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Each year, 26,000
men in the
United States die from prostate
cancer.

23:15.827 --> 23:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is confusion over
conflicting advice
about whom should get tested for
the disease.

23:21.767 --> 23:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is new guidance out today
from an influential
task force.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our William Brangham has that
story.

23:27.539 --> 23:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Here's where
some of the
confusion started.

23:30.609 --> 23:36.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Five years ago, the U.S.
Preventive Services
Task Force told men aged 55 and
over not to

23:36.181 --> 23:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undergo the common PSA test for
prostate cancer,
citing fears of overtreatment or
false positives.

23:42.387 --> 23:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, that panel reversed
course, saying
that men 55 to 69 should
consider the test,

23:48.727 --> 23:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that men 70 and over should
still skip
it.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined now by the doctor who
chairs that
task force.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo is
an general
internist at U.C.

23:57.936 --> 23:58.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
San Francisco.

23:58.970 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

23:59.971 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO, U.S.
Preventive Services
Task Force: Thank you for having
me.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, forgive my
sense of
whiplash here, but help me
understand, what

24:06.244 --> 24:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the task force recommending
today?

24:08.413 --> 24:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the evidence behind your
recommendation?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: The
task force is
recommending that men between
the ages of

24:13.852 --> 24:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
55 and 69 have a conversation
with their doctor
about prostate cancer screening.

24:18.824 --> 24:21.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want men to know about the
benefits of
screening.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want them to also be aware of
the harms
that might occur along the along
the way during

24:25.630 --> 24:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the process of screening.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The key here is that men should
have this
discussion.

24:29.868 --> 24:34.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They should be aware the
benefits and harms
and then make the right decision
that's right

24:34.539 --> 24:35.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, what
would be the
harms?

24:37.242 --> 24:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can understand the benefits.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can find out whether you
have cancer
or not, but what are the harms
involved?

24:41.847 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: The
challenge with
prostate cancer screening is the
test that

24:45.917 --> 24:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we use, the PSA test, is not
that good for
distinguishing the types of
cancers that are

24:51.056 --> 24:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to cause problems, the
aggressive cancers,
distinguishing those from those
that are slow-growing

24:56.261 --> 24:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and may not cause a man a
problem during his
lifetime.

24:59.564 --> 25:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since most men who get
diagnosed end up
getting treated, those men are
then subjected

25:05.170 --> 25:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the harms of treatment, which
are important,
and include impotence and
incontinence, harms

25:10.242 --> 25:12.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that happen in most men.

25:12.444 --> 25:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're fortunate that the task
force has new
evidence.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have new evidence that led to
the change
in our grade.

25:19.451 --> 25:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the new evidence is both
about the benefits,
but also about approaches that
can be used

25:24.155 --> 25:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow some men to reduce some
of these
harms.

25:27.792 --> 25:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's just
say I'm one
of these men, I get the test,
and the PSA

25:32.597 --> 25:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test indicates that I have
cancer.

25:35.667 --> 25:36.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's next?

25:36.668 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: So,
after the PSA
test, you would have to have a
prostate biopsy.

25:40.438 --> 25:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what would be important
for us to really
determine whether you have
cancer.

25:45.343 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The strategy called active
surveillance was
one of those new strategies that
we reviewed

25:50.515 --> 25:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evidence for in the update.

25:52.884 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have low-risk prostate
cancer, this
might allow you to -- active
surveillance

25:58.723 --> 26:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might allow you to avoid or
delay treatment,
because we watch you over time
to see if the

26:05.931 --> 26:10.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cancer is progressing, and only
treat those
men whose cancer is progressing.

26:10.235 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that was what allowed us
to say that,
for some men, the harms might be
reduced.

26:15.073 --> 26:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if I
understand correctly,
the new evidence that has helped
you change

26:19.311 --> 26:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your minds was that this testing
saves more
lives than it hurts in these
ancillary side

26:26.851 --> 26:27.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effects?

26:27.852 --> 26:29.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: Well, I
think the
most important thing to say is
that there

26:31.323 --> 26:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are benefits and there are
harms, and what
that balance looks like for any
given man

26:37.062 --> 26:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
depends on how he values those
benefits and
harms.

26:39.898 --> 26:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, some men might say, I want
to reduce my
chance of dying of prostate
cancer no matter

26:45.170 --> 26:46.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
what.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't care about the risks
that you're talking
about.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's go ahead.

26:50.675 --> 26:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other men who might
say, the likelihood
of benefiting from screening is
so small.

26:54.813 --> 27:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only about one or two men
in 1,000 screened
who actually are prevented from
dying.

27:01.686 --> 27:07.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That man might say, that
likelihood is too
low, and I'm not willing to be
-- to subject

27:07.892 --> 27:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
myself to the potential risks
associated with
screening.

27:10.862 --> 27:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And there's a
lot of urologists
-- and I know the American
cancer society

27:14.232 --> 27:15.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has come out.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are very happy with your
new guidelines.

27:17.035 --> 27:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other doctors who have
said this
is a complicated conversation
that you're

27:20.805 --> 27:24.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking people to have with their
doctors,
doctors don't have a lot of time
to talk their

27:24.376 --> 27:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patients, and that they worry
that these guidelines
will be blanket everybody get a
PSA test,

27:30.115 --> 27:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that then we will see all of
these negative
side effects.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you weigh that concern?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: Well,
it's definitely
true that these are complex
discussions.

27:39.557 --> 27:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are complex decisions.

27:41.693 --> 27:47.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do think that every man
deserves to really
understand what the science is
telling them.

27:47.265 --> 27:52.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's why we really
emphasize that these
discussions are important ones
to be had between

27:52.504 --> 27:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doctors and patients to really
understand,
for any given man, what is the
right choice

27:56.641 --> 27:58.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him?

27:58.143 --> 28:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are happy that many have
engaged in the
conversation.

28:02.047 --> 28:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's rally important that we
get the right
input and have the discussion
about our draft

28:07.318 --> 28:09.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recommendation.

28:09.120 --> 28:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, the most
important thing
for a given man is that he is
aware that the

28:13.692 --> 28:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science is telling us about
benefits and harms,
and that he uses that together
to make the

28:17.996 --> 28:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right decision for himself.

28:19.731 --> 28:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the
recommendations
are, 55 to 69, strongly consider
the test,

28:25.470 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk to your doctor about it,
men over 70,
not necessary.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about younger men under 55?

28:31.342 --> 28:32.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: So,
there are definite
gaps in our evidence right now.

28:35.580 --> 28:40.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We'd like to have better
research about the
types of tests that we could use
to screen

28:40.085 --> 28:41.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for prostate cancer.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told you PSA test is not a
great test.

28:43.988 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'd like to have more research
on high-risk
men.

28:46.791 --> 28:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that African-American
men have higher
risks of prostate cancer.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So do men with a family history.

28:52.464 --> 28:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of times, these are the
types of cancer
that occur in men earlier in
life.

28:56.968 --> 29:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just don't have enough
evidence about how
we can screen those men
effectively, what's

29:02.507 --> 29:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best age to start, how often
to screen.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We really need evidence for
these men.

29:08.513 --> 29:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the absence of that evidence,
I would say
that our recommendations
definitely apply

29:12.117 --> 29:13.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these high-risk men.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's important to get out
there.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we also need more research.

29:16.287 --> 29:21.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.
Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo,
thank you very much.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:23.228 --> 29:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIRSTEN BIBBINS-DOMINGO: Thank
you.

29:29.134 --> 29:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:32.904 --> 29:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
generation
torn out of school by the Syrian
civil war;

29:38.443 --> 29:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bat-killing disease that's
spread across
the entire country; and making
art out of

29:44.949 --> 29:46.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
breaking news.

29:46.751 --> 29:52.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The international
uproar continued
over the forced removal of a
passenger from

29:52.223 --> 29:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a United Airlines flight.

29:54.092 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the airline's CEO, Oscar
Munoz, issued
an apology, saying -- quote --
"No one should

30:00.398 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ever be mistreated this way.

30:02.500 --> 30:07.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want you to know that we take
full responsibility,
and we will work to make it
right."

30:07.839 --> 30:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along with the outrage, many
were asking,
how could this happen?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Jeffrey Brown picks up the
story.

30:13.344 --> 30:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, by now, the
video has
been watched hundreds of
millions of times,

30:17.982 --> 30:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including more than 270 million
on social
media in China, where many
wondered if the

30:22.887 --> 30:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passenger had been singled out
because he
is of Asian descent.

30:26.858 --> 30:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cell phone video shows a
bloodied man
identified as Dr. David Dao
being pulled from

30:32.831 --> 30:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his seat on a plane set to
depart from Chicago
on Sunday night.

30:37.035 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flight was sold out, and
passengers were
first offered vouchers to take
another flight,

30:42.240 --> 30:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so members of a United crew
could board.

30:44.709 --> 30:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When that didn't work, Dao and
three other
passengers were asked to leave.

30:49.047 --> 30:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Questions remain about what
happened, and
what's supposed to happen in a
situation like

30:53.151 --> 30:54.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

30:54.519 --> 30:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ben Mutzabaugh is covering it
for USA Today,
and joins me now.

30:58.122 --> 30:59.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH, USA Today:
Thanks for having
me.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One thing that
was clarified
today was that the flight was
actually not

31:03.361 --> 31:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overbooked, but oversold, right,
sold out?

31:06.865 --> 31:07.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: Right.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's correct.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it won't move the needle a
whole lot,
given the video that we saw, but
what technically

31:12.036 --> 31:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened was, the plane was
full.

31:14.339 --> 31:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United had four employees of
their affiliate
Republic Airlines that needed to
make it to

31:18.543 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louisville so more flights
didn't end up getting
canceled down the line.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They had to make space for them.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They needed four volunteers.

31:24.816 --> 31:29.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Three were OK with being
voluntarily kicked
off the plane.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One wasn't, and here we are.

31:31.522 --> 31:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, as we heard,
the CEO,
Munoz, gave an apology today,
after huge criticism

31:37.161 --> 31:40.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for not apologizing sufficiently
up to this
point.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a -- this is a mess for
United, right?

31:42.734 --> 31:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: This has really,
really spiraled
out of control.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the apology today
was probably
helpful.

31:48.473 --> 31:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly sounded more
sincere than the
one that we got yesterday.

31:52.277 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also came after the
internal memo that
pretty much said employees had
done things

31:56.447 --> 31:58.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the right way.

31:58.216 --> 32:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if that's true, you
can't see that
video and have that go over well
with what

32:01.719 --> 32:03.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you hear.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are facing a full-fledged,
all-out public
relations crisis at a time when
they're really

32:07.292 --> 32:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to change the perception
of the airline.

32:09.093 --> 32:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, everybody
watching this,
everybody who flies is
wondering, what kind

32:13.932 --> 32:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of rules apply or should apply
in a case like
this?

32:17.969 --> 32:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's very common these days
that flights
are overbooked, right?

32:21.673 --> 32:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the way the airlines
operate.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What rules apply?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: So, the
government says airlines
can overbook flights.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can sell more seats than
there are on
the plane.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to inform you of your
rights, and
then they have the call for
volunteers.

32:33.451 --> 32:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if that doesn't happen, the
airlines
can remove passengers based on a
list of criteria.

32:39.557 --> 32:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing the government
really requires
in the scenario is for the
airlines to inform

32:43.328 --> 32:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passengers of their rights and
to get a written
copy of the rules, which
basically list the

32:47.932 --> 32:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criteria that they will use to
choose people
to leave the flight.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they set compensation levels
that pretty
much top out, if you get to a
domestic destination

32:55.907 --> 33:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than two hours late, you
will get 400
percent of your one-way ticket
for that flight

33:00.445 --> 33:02.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or a maximum of $1,350.

33:02.280 --> 33:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, but it if
comes to that,
where they really need -- first
of all, they

33:06.651 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer the vouchers we're all
familiar with,
right, try to lure people to
take...

33:10.855 --> 33:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: Right, yes,
start at $200,
go to $300, and keep raising.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

33:14.325 --> 33:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this case, I understand
United was
offering up to $1,000 to get
people to...

33:18.329 --> 33:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: Definitely $800.

33:20.098 --> 33:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen some reports --
there are so
many -- watching this spiral out
of control,

33:23.101 --> 33:26.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's amazing to see all the
stories that have
surfaced on social media, which
is probably

33:26.604 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the problem for United.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, yes, they offered $800,
$1,000.

33:30.441 --> 33:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No takers, until they got to the
last four.

33:33.478 --> 33:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they just couldn't --
should have
raised it more perhaps.

33:36.781 --> 33:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, when it
gets to this
next stage where they are asking
people to

33:41.853 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave, do we know -- you're
saying every airline
has its own criteria?

33:46.624 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do they decide on who
they're going to
ask to get up and go?

33:50.261 --> 33:54.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: It's generally a
combination
of frequent flyer status, the
fare paid, lowest

33:54.732 --> 33:56.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fare paid.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cynics will say that if you
boot the person
who paid the lowest fare, that
the least amount

34:00.104 --> 34:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of compensation you will owe
them under the
federal regulations on dumping
about what

34:05.209 --> 34:06.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you would owe them.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it stands to reason you might
bump passengers
who have paid the lowest fare.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other things can include the
last ones to
check in.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is really a list of
factors.

34:13.918 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But perhaps -- perhaps what
makes this so
troubling for the airlines, and
especially

34:18.022 --> 34:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a situation like this, is
that, although
it's somewhat transparent, it's
not completely

34:22.460 --> 34:23.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transparent.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You get a list of factors, but
not a hard-and-fast
checklist.

34:25.129 --> 34:26.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

34:26.964 --> 34:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then if you want to -- if
you want to
say no, as Dr. Dao does -- did,
do passengers

34:32.136 --> 34:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have any rights to say no?

34:33.471 --> 34:35.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: They do not.

34:35.173 --> 34:39.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this is where this
particular situation,
I think, really went off the
rails.

34:39.410 --> 34:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, United probably, in my
opinion, should
have done more to entice him or
someone else

34:44.649 --> 34:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get off the plane, because,
once you turn
this situation over to the
authorities, you

34:49.987 --> 34:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have got an airline that says
you have to
get off the plane, you have got
a passenger

34:52.857 --> 34:54.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who says, I'm not getting off
the plane.

34:54.792 --> 34:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you call authorities then,
there is pretty
much only one way that turns
out.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we saw in the
video.

34:59.797 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, admittedly, that video
turned out probably
much worse than anyone would
have anticipated.

35:04.702 --> 35:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they could have done
anything and got
Mr. Dao off the plane, this
becomes a local

35:09.240 --> 35:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- not even a local story in
Louisville, and
we're not talking about it
today.

35:11.843 --> 35:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, just in our
last 30 seconds
here, I mean, people still book
mostly based

35:17.014 --> 35:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on price and convenience, right?

35:18.449 --> 35:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: That's right.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How much brand
loyalty is there?

35:21.752 --> 35:24.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much lasting impact would
you expect this
to have?

35:24.055 --> 35:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: There are
frequent flyers
who will stick with an airline
no matter what.

35:27.191 --> 35:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we have seen for the
public at large,
people who are infrequent
flyers, no matter

35:31.295 --> 35:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how big the scandal, no matter
how big the
crisis, no matter how poor the
reputation,

35:35.700 --> 35:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passengers have shown time and
time again
they will book the fare that's
$199, instead

35:40.204 --> 35:42.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of $200, no matter what.

35:42.173 --> 35:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it remains to be -- this
has turned into
a pretty big situation for
United.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, this is
unusual, right?

35:47.512 --> 35:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not good attention for
United.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: This will test
that.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This will test that.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the precedent says people
will come back
if the fares are lower.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will be watching carefully.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: Exactly.

35:56.821 --> 36:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Ben
Mutzabaugh of
USA Today, thank you very much.

36:00.491 --> 36:08.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN MUTZABAUGH: Thank you.

36:08.099 --> 36:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White-nose
syndrome is a disease
that has been killing millions
of bats across

36:15.773 --> 36:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Northeastern U.S. since
2006.

36:19.410 --> 36:23.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last year, the disease
mysteriously appeared
in the Seattle area.

36:23.347 --> 36:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Michael Werner from Public
Media's EarthFix
desk reports, researchers are
racing to learn

36:28.986 --> 36:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what West Coast bats are in for.

36:34.959 --> 36:45.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL WERNER: Wildlife
veterinarian John
Huckabee is on the lookout for
symptoms of

36:45.036 --> 36:49.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a deadly and contagious disease,
a disease
that kills bats by the millions.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:51.776 --> 36:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HUCKABEE, PAWS Wildlife
Center: There
are a few small deep pigmented
areas of scarring,

36:53.578 --> 36:56.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, overall, looks like he's in
very good
shape.

36:56.414 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL WERNER: This
silver-haired bat doesn't
seem to be a carrier.

36:59.750 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, a few months ago, a little
brown bat
arrived at his office outside
Seattle.

37:04.288 --> 37:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HUCKABEE: I saw that one of
the wings
had a lot of contracture and
some wounds,

37:11.028 --> 37:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some lesions on the wing, and it
had an appearance
that it may have a fungal
infection.

37:16.367 --> 37:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: The odd scarring
was a possible
sign of white-nose syndrome, one
of the deadliest

37:21.172 --> 37:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wildlife diseases in modern
times.

37:24.642 --> 37:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First discovered in New York
state in 2006,
white-nose syndrome has killed
more than 5.5

37:29.780 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
million bats and counting.

37:31.749 --> 37:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The disease, which is spread
primarily by
bat-to-bat contact, has wreaked
havoc on the

37:37.421 --> 37:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
large colonies of the East
Coast.

37:39.290 --> 37:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY COLEMAN, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service:
We have seen populations of bats
in eastern

37:42.627 --> 37:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
colonies decline, in some cases,
to 100 percent.

37:46.330 --> 37:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: Until recently,
it wasn't
known how the disease killed its
victims,

37:50.768 --> 37:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but new research suggests that
bats with white-nose
wake up more often during
hibernation.

37:56.641 --> 38:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This causes them to burn through
fat reserves
that would usually sustain them
through the

38:00.244 --> 38:02.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winter.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Starvation and death soon
follow.

38:04.348 --> 38:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In just a few short years, the
epidemic raced
across the country, spreading
from the Northeast

38:10.621 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the way to Nebraska and
Oklahoma.

38:12.623 --> 38:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then it hit an enormous
natural barrier.

38:17.662 --> 38:23.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Rocky Mountains kept the
disease from
reaching Western bats, or so
scientists thought,

38:24.001 --> 38:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
until Huckabee's discovery.

38:26.270 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some speculate that an infected
bat may have
hitched a ride on a freight
truck.

38:31.075 --> 38:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others think hikers or cavers
may have unwittingly
carried the fungus on their
clothes or equipment.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the first infected bat was
found in
the forests east of Seattle, the
white-nose

38:41.018 --> 38:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fungus has been found twice more
in Washington
state, both near the original
site around

38:46.023 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Bend.

38:47.024 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We have bats in the net.

38:52.029 --> 38:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: Fear of a
white-nose outbreak
has jump-started research, not
just in Washington,

38:57.802 --> 39:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but around the Northwest.

39:01.105 --> 39:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Central Oregon, ecologist Tom
Rodhouse
and a team of researchers are
collecting data

39:05.409 --> 39:06.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on local bats.

39:06.811 --> 39:08.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM RODHOUSE, National Park
Service: Bats
hang out in the dark.

39:08.279 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They hang out in these big
cliffs and crevices
that we can't access.

39:11.215 --> 39:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have gone for decades
without really
understanding what's happening
with bats.

39:15.986 --> 39:20.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: They're trying
to assess the
health and population size of
Oregon's 15

39:20.958 --> 39:22.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
species of bats.

39:22.727 --> 39:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM RODHOUSE: There's really no
way for us
to ascertain what's happening
with our bat

39:26.163 --> 39:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
populations without this kind of
a coordinated
large-scale survey effort.

39:32.002 --> 39:40.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL WERNER: Back in
Washington, researchers
such as Abby Tobin are trying to
learn how

39:40.978 --> 39:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bats spend their winters.

39:42.780 --> 39:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBY TOBIN, Researcher: We're
trying to figure
out what type of habitats
they're roosting

39:46.484 --> 39:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, if they're hibernating
through the winter,
or if they are kind of active
throughout,

39:51.455 --> 39:57.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also looking at those
habitats they're
using, and whether the
environment there is

39:57.061 --> 39:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conducive for the fungus to
thrive.

39:58.796 --> 40:10.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why don't we kind of go down a
little bit
and see away from the trail?

40:10.074 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: She's setting up
bat detectors,
specialized microphones that can
pick up bats'

40:18.449 --> 40:20.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
high-frequency calls.

40:20.384 --> 40:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBY TOBIN: Each bat has a
unique echolocation
call, and so we're able to
identify them based

40:26.657 --> 40:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on that call from those acoustic
detectors.

40:31.529 --> 40:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From this, I could tell this is
canyon bat.

40:38.702 --> 40:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have this typical kind
of hockey
stick shape look to their claw.

40:44.108 --> 40:51.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WERNER: In the lab,
Tobin looks for
small signs the disease is
taking hold in

40:51.749 --> 40:52.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

40:53.017 --> 40:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABBY TOBIN: And there's a couple
little tiny
little holes.

40:56.153 --> 41:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am looking right now to see if
there is
any damage to the wing
membranes, which would

41:01.725 --> 41:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a sign that it had white-nose
syndrome.

41:04.895 --> 41:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's important to detect
white-nose syndrome
early because it allows us to
get a sense

41:09.433 --> 41:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of where it is, and so we might
be able to
do some sort of containment or
treatment with

41:14.104 --> 41:15.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the animals.

41:15.873 --> 41:20.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL WERNER: Despite
white-nose's deadly
effects on bats, it poses no
known threat

41:20.744 --> 41:21.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to people.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But many questions remain.

41:24.014 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it could be years before
definitive answers
emerge.

41:28.352 --> 41:32.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Michael Werner
in Seattle.

41:32.523 --> 41:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a postscript:
High school
students at our Student
Reporting Lab outside

41:37.294 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Louisville, Kentucky,
produced a story
on the effect of white-nose
syndrome on bats

41:42.266 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at Mammoth Cave National Park.

41:44.668 --> 41:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that report on
studentreportinglabs.org.

41:54.712 --> 41:59.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that report on
studentreportinglabs.org.

41:59.783 --> 42:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's return to the war in
Syria, and focus
on the effect it is having on
children.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The schools have been
devastated.

42:07.057 --> 42:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than a third have closed
since the war
began.

42:10.661 --> 42:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a recent report by the
International Rescue
Committee found more than 1.7
million children

42:16.433 --> 42:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and youth are not attending
classes.

42:19.303 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the focus of our weekly
segment Making
the Grade.

42:22.606 --> 42:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're joined by David
Miliband the president
of the International Rescue
Committee.

42:26.911 --> 42:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He recently visited the region
and refugee
children in Lebanon.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Miliband, welcome back to
the program.

42:34.151 --> 42:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know this war has taken a
terrible toll
on lives in so many ways, but
what is the

42:39.423 --> 42:43.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main finding of your report on
the effect
on children and their ability to
learn?

42:43.360 --> 42:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, President,
International Rescue
Committee: Thank you, Judy.

42:45.663 --> 42:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the situation inside Syria
is obviously
top of the news because of the
crushing and

42:50.868 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appalling chemical weapons
attacks last week.

42:54.338 --> 43:00.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the long-term impact of six
years of war
on about 1.7 million children
inside the country

43:00.744 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are being denied education
is obviously
very grave indeed.

43:04.081 --> 43:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is the fundamental stress,
what is called
the toxic stress, of being
involved in a war.

43:09.386 --> 43:13.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for those inside the
country, they're
denied the most basic access to
education.

43:13.190 --> 43:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, that problem is
doubled by the
experience of the refugees who
are out of

43:18.028 --> 43:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the country, 5.5 million
refugees out of the
country, half of them kids,
probably half

43:22.666 --> 43:24.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of those not getting an
education at all.

43:24.501 --> 43:29.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is true to talk about a
generation
of Syrian schoolchildren being
denied the

43:29.206 --> 43:31.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most basic elements of an
education.

43:31.241 --> 43:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, that stands in
stark contrast
to the fact that they would have
expected,

43:36.513 --> 43:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a middle-income country,
which Syria was
before 2011, to get a decent
education.

43:41.151 --> 43:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does this
mean?

43:43.053 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Based on this report that the
International
Rescue Committee has put
together, what does

43:47.391 --> 43:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this mean specifically in terms
of children's
literacy, their ability to read,
their ability

43:52.162 --> 43:53.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do basic math?

43:54.031 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, we found
that children
in grades six, seven, eight, so
children almost

44:00.671 --> 44:06.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approaching teenage years, were
unable to
do the kind of sums or spelling
that you would

44:06.543 --> 44:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expect from a grade one student.

44:08.345 --> 44:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's what six years of
education being
lost means, never mind the huge
blow to the

44:14.451 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children's understanding and
self-esteem that
comes from seeing their country
blown apart,

44:19.156 --> 44:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and often their families blown
apart as well.

44:22.359 --> 44:27.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that the message
I would get
across to your viewers is that
the toll on

44:27.297 --> 44:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children is almost greater than
on any other
group.

44:30.134 --> 44:34.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, secondly, never
underestimate the resilience
of the children and the ability
of them, when

44:34.972 --> 44:38.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
given proper educational
provision, to bounce
back.

44:38.475 --> 44:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We, the International Rescue
Committee, offer
education in the north of Syria
to children

44:42.713 --> 44:43.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside the country.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also offer education in the
neighboring
states.

44:46.350 --> 44:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we find is that,
however hard the
children have been hit, there's
a remarkable

44:51.221 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capacity to bounce back, if
they're given
proper help.

44:53.657 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that makes international
humanitarian
aid especially important.

44:57.094 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is
proper help?

44:59.096 --> 45:00.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that consist of?

45:00.864 --> 45:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what can be done about this?

45:02.666 --> 45:07.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because people are certainly
looking for ways
out of this war, but, if
anything, that looks

45:07.204 --> 45:09.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harder than ever today.

45:09.039 --> 45:14.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: You're right
about the huge
diplomatic effort that's going
to be necessary.

45:14.111 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the humanitarian front,
and especially
the educational front, there are
two things

45:18.582 --> 45:20.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are essential.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, there's no point
in pretending
that kids who have been through
a war are

45:23.020 --> 45:26.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like any other first grader or
fifth grader
turning up for school.

45:26.657 --> 45:30.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need proper attention to
their social
and emotional resources.

45:30.994 --> 45:35.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's called the toxic stress
that they have
suffered is effectively brain
damage and/or

45:35.566 --> 45:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what would be called amongst
adults PTSD.

45:38.235 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these children need to have
that addressed
before they're able to access
learning.

45:41.605 --> 45:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, in addition to those
social and emotional
skills and resources that they
need to build

45:46.276 --> 45:49.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, they also need the basic
elements of an
education.

45:50.013 --> 45:55.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our argument is that, at a
time when the
overall humanitarian budget is
under huge

45:55.586 --> 46:00.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stress, at a time when less than
2 percent
of the global humanitarian
budget is spent

46:00.491 --> 46:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on education, that is the worst
possible time
for the administration in
Washington to be

46:05.996 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about one-third cuts, 31
percent cuts
in America's contribution to
humanitarian

46:11.268 --> 46:15.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid, because America has often
marked itself
out for its commitment on the
humanitarian

46:15.739 --> 46:17.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
front.

46:17.207 --> 46:19.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those children in Syria who
we surveyed,
they need America's help.

46:19.610 --> 46:23.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
there's a
direct link between what the
U.S. does in

46:23.213 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms of foreign aid and the
long-term repercussions,
survival of these children, and
their ability

46:29.486 --> 46:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be functioning human beings?

46:32.556 --> 46:35.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, you don't
need to just
take my word for it.

46:35.592 --> 46:39.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I lead a humanitarian
organization, so you
might expect me to say that
humanitarian aid

46:39.696 --> 46:41.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is important.

46:41.098 --> 46:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just listen to the U.S.
defense secretary,
Secretary Mattis.

46:43.934 --> 46:48.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's very clear, as a military
man, that military
effort on its own, it needs to
be -- is not

46:48.505 --> 46:50.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enough on its own.

46:50.374 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It needs to be allied obviously
to diplomatic
effort, but also to humanitarian
and development

46:54.344 --> 46:56.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
efforts as well.

46:56.146 --> 46:59.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those three aspects of
American foreign
policy, the military, the
diplomacy and the

46:59.817 --> 47:02.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
humanitarian development, need
to go together.

47:02.719 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the suggestion from the
administration
that now is the time to slash
America's leadership

47:09.426 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on humanitarian aid seems
extremely misguided.

47:11.962 --> 47:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're living through the world's
-- certainly
this century's worst civil war
in Syria.

47:16.800 --> 47:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know there are four famines
that are hitting
parts of Africa.

47:20.871 --> 47:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The global refugee crisis is at
its height.

47:23.874 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Humanitarian aid is an essential
commitment
to the future of those children,
but it's

47:27.811 --> 47:30.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also a stabilizer of the
societies from which
they come.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned the defense
secretary, James Mattis.

47:32.883 --> 47:37.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, he said at his news
conference today
that the U.S. -- it sounded as
if what he

47:37.654 --> 47:42.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was saying was that, unless
there is another
chemical weapons attack by the
Assad regime,

47:42.526 --> 47:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point, the U.S. has no
further plan
to intervene militarily.

47:47.197 --> 47:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that mean for the
efforts of groups
like the International Rescue
Committee?

47:50.701 --> 47:56.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, we can
report from the
ground that our staff -- I have
got about

47:56.540 --> 48:01.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1,400 staff working for the
International
Rescue Committee inside Syria.

48:01.178 --> 48:04.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They rushed towards that
chemical weapons
attack in an ambulance.

48:04.281 --> 48:09.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They rescued 10 people, took
them to a hospital
in Idlib, and saved their lives.

48:09.519 --> 48:13.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, obviously, they are in fear
not just
of chemical weapons attacks, but
conventional

48:13.557 --> 48:15.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weapons attacks as well.

48:15.392 --> 48:20.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so my message from the
ground would be
that we -- it's incumbent on
American political

48:20.998 --> 48:26.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership to make stop the
killing the central
demand that is made of all the
actors in the

48:26.603 --> 48:28.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

48:28.405 --> 48:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until we stop the killing, then
not only will
the humanitarian situation get
worse, but

48:32.142 --> 48:36.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prospects for any kind of
durable peace
evaporate as well.

48:36.613 --> 48:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my fear from the ground is
that, in the
few days since the chemical
weapons attacks,

48:41.785 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there's actually been an
intensification of
the conventional weapons
warfare.

48:47.057 --> 48:51.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's obviously cold
comfort to anyone
on the ground trying to live
their life inside

48:51.495 --> 48:53.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

48:53.430 --> 48:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it was clear
today, again,
just quickly, in listening to
Secretary Mattis,

48:56.300 --> 49:00.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the administration is right
now drawing
a line between responding if
there is a chemical

49:00.804 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons attack, but something
very different
if it's short of, even if it's
barrel bombs

49:06.710 --> 49:08.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on civilians.

49:08.512 --> 49:12.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, obviously,
as a leader
of a humanitarian organization,
it's not for

49:12.049 --> 49:15.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me to advocate one military
tactic or another.

49:15.319 --> 49:20.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I can say is that the
situation on the
ground is grave and getting
worse, that the

49:20.657 --> 49:26.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fires that are being
proclaimed at various
points haven't held at all, and
that, with

49:26.430 --> 49:34.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
500,000 dead, 5.5 million
refugees, it's well
past the time when Syria wasn't
just a humanitarian

49:34.538 --> 49:36.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
emergency, but it was a
political emergency
as well.

49:36.940 --> 49:41.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a source of massive
instability across
the Middle East and into Europe.

49:41.578 --> 49:44.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that calls for the highest
levels of diplomatic
and political engagement.

49:44.614 --> 49:48.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Miliband,
the president
of the International Rescue
Committee, thank

49:48.418 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

49:49.419 --> 49:55.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Thank you so
much.

49:55.258 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
A museum exhibition
explores a different way of
covering the news

50:04.801 --> 50:06.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through art.

50:06.370 --> 50:09.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with the
story from
a recent trip to Los Angeles.

50:09.806 --> 50:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Twenty-four-hour
news channels,
digital news feeds, the latest
tweet, it's

50:17.247 --> 50:23.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the now-familiar, nonstop,
sometimes overwhelming
world of news and information we
live in.

50:23.620 --> 50:28.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that sense of news
bombardment isn't really
new, and an exhibition at the
Getty Museum

50:28.959 --> 50:34.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Los Angeles shows how artists
have often
commented on, wrestled and
played with it.

50:34.931 --> 50:36.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Curator Arpad Kovacs:

50:36.800 --> 50:38.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARPAD KOVACS, Curator, J. Paul
Getty Museum:
Most of us just don't know how
to make sense

50:38.735 --> 50:40.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

50:40.504 --> 50:44.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's where artists
step in and
are able to kind of make
something fruitful

50:44.608 --> 50:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sort of thoughtful, and take
the images,
take the text, take the
information as source

50:50.814 --> 50:56.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
material to make something that
looks critically
at the information that we
receive every single

50:56.286 --> 50:58.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

50:58.155 --> 51:01.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The exhibition,
titled Breaking
News, takes us to a pre-Internet
era, featuring

51:01.758 --> 51:07.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work by artists often seeking
political, as
well as aesthetic expression.

51:07.064 --> 51:12.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Martha Rosler, the starting
point was
"LIFE" magazine as a guide to
the American

51:12.269 --> 51:13.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
psyche.

51:13.770 --> 51:17.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the Vietnam War raged, the
magazine captured
the war in photographs.

51:17.974 --> 51:20.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But turn the page to sumptuous
home interiors.

51:20.944 --> 51:26.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosler put the two together, in
one photo,
Pat Nixon in the White House,
with the image

51:26.983 --> 51:29.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of a war victim over the
fireplace.

51:29.086 --> 51:34.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARPAD KOVACS: She's making this
juxtaposition,
bringing these two disparate
images together,

51:34.424 --> 51:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an effort to show how we can
sometimes
be oblivious to what's happening
in this world.

51:42.232 --> 51:44.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD BLUMBERG, Artist: This
stuff is from
'70-'72.

51:44.234 --> 51:50.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Artist Donald
Blumberg also
sought to transform a news
medium into a work

51:50.073 --> 51:53.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of art, one that says something
about the
times.

51:53.944 --> 51:58.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took images from newspaper
stories about
slain soldiers or war
atrocities.

51:58.648 --> 52:06.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD BLUMBERG: And I
re-photographed them,
and I wanted to enlarge them to
a size that

52:06.556 --> 52:10.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was inescapable for the viewer
to pass.

52:10.560 --> 52:14.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was intended to be a
direct political
act against the war in Vietnam.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what it was intended to
do.

52:16.366 --> 52:19.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: By saying, look
hard at these
photographs that sort of appear.

52:19.603 --> 52:20.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD BLUMBERG: Look hard.

52:20.604 --> 52:22.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can't escape it.

52:22.372 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He also began
photographing
his television set, freezing in
time major

52:25.742 --> 52:27.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historical events.

52:27.744 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His first work captured images
from the funeral
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

52:32.315 --> 52:39.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD BLUMBERG: It was a way of
creating
a reportage to photograph off
the television

52:39.723 --> 52:46.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and translate it into a mosaic,
a mosaic in
which a person could look at the
whole story

52:46.963 --> 52:56.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and break it up into little
fragments, one
cell, two cell, horizontally,
diagonally.

52:56.139 --> 53:03.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Then there's a
kind of strange
news poem created by Omer Fast
in the wake

53:03.346 --> 53:05.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the 9/11 attacks.

53:05.615 --> 53:09.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He took single words spoken by
CNN anchors
and reporters.

53:09.519 --> 53:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will certainly recognize one
of them.

53:11.421 --> 53:12.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The standard of
reporting.

53:12.756 --> 53:16.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To fashion a
piece about fear
and anxiety.

53:16.960 --> 53:21.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Heinecken played with
news anchors
in a different way, as a kind of
commodity,

53:21.798 --> 53:26.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his piece, Case Study in
Finding An Appropriate
Newswoman.

53:26.403 --> 53:30.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He used photos of newscasters
and combined
them into an idealized
co-anchor.

53:30.874 --> 53:37.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARPAD KOVACS: I think what he
was interested
in is trying to reveal all of
the complex

53:37.714 --> 53:44.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions that go into making
such a choice
that the general public is not
aware of.

53:44.521 --> 53:51.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, we have five panels in
which he's reproduced
issues of "LIFE" magazine.

53:51.161 --> 53:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For some artists,
the subject
was what's left out, what's not
there.

53:56.866 --> 54:03.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar
created this large-scale
five-panel piece with every
cover of "LIFE"

54:03.707 --> 54:04.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
magazine.

54:04.708 --> 54:06.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In a kind of "Where's Waldo?"

54:06.276 --> 54:09.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
style, he called it Searching
for Africa in
Life.

54:09.446 --> 54:14.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARPAD KOVACS: When you look at
this work,
you realize that there are very
few instances

54:14.784 --> 54:17.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the continent of Africa is
represented.

54:17.921 --> 54:23.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in many of those instances,
it's actually
rather ambiguous whether the
cover pertains

54:23.526 --> 54:26.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a story that deals with
Africa.

54:26.663 --> 54:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The news as art,
the art of
the news.

54:30.267 --> 54:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The exhibition Breaking News is
at the Getty
through April.

54:34.037 --> 54:37.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Los Angeles, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

54:37.307 --> 54:42.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for the
record, the Getty
Foundation helps to underwrite
the "NewsHour."

54:42.545 --> 54:43.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:45.148 --> 54:47.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:47.350 --> 54:57.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:57.394 --> 55:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
