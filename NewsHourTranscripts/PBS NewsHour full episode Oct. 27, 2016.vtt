00:23.190 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: why the
United States'
prosperity could be its downfall
-- a look

00:29.029 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the history of empires
to explore
the true cost of wealth.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ, Author, "The
Price of Prosperity:
Why Rich Nations Fail and How to
Renew Them":

00:34.902 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They undermine themselves, and
they do that
by racking up more debt, by
having fewer babies

00:41.208 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
born, by more regulation.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's difficult to keep up
patriotism as
time goes by.

00:47.247 --> 00:52.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
guiding grace of
food -- TV chef Anthony Bourdain
gives his

00:52.519 --> 00:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take on the power of food in his
own life
and in how we connect with
others.

00:57.024 --> 01:00.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BOURDAIN, Chef: Food may
not be the
answer to world peace, but it's
a start.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think I was thinking of Ted
Nugent.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find just about everything
that comes out
of his mouth violently
offensive, but we both

01:06.633 --> 01:08.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like barbecue.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is some kind of common
ground for a discussion.

01:11.071 --> 01:19.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's

are gearing up for one final
push.

01:34.294 --> 01:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This day found them hard at it
in two crucial
states.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:39.866 --> 01:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump's
race to 270
electoral votes, at least today,
meant hopscotching

01:46.239 --> 01:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across battleground Ohio, first
stop, Springfield,
the nominee greeted by
supporters, brimming

01:52.512 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with confidence:

01:54.314 --> 01:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If we win on November 8, when --
OK, OK -- when

01:55.082 --> 01:57.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we win on November 8.

01:57.517 --> 02:02.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:02.522 --> 02:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump hit on
familiar themes,
protecting borders, improving
the economy,

02:11.465 --> 02:16.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then he touched on the
latest Clinton
news: e-mails about corporations
that donated

02:16.403 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Clinton Foundation and
paid Bill Clinton
to speak as well.

02:20.640 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If the Clinton's
were willing
to play this fast and loose with
their enterprise

02:27.014 --> 02:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they weren't in the White
House, just
imagine what they will do, given
the chance

02:32.352 --> 02:35.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to once again control the Oval
Office.

02:35.622 --> 02:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Separately, in
an ABC interview,
Trump faced a question about
after the election,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how he'd handle his sharp
divide with
Hillary Clinton.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC News:
If she wins,
are you prepared to work with
her?

02:46.466 --> 02:48.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I just want to
make that decision
at a later date.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not saying I'm not or I am.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hopefully, I won't have to make
that decision.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really believe we're going to
win.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Similarly, on
her campaign
plane last night, Clinton was
asked if she

02:57.778 --> 03:00.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would meet with Trump after it's
over.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She also demurred.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I certainly intend to reach out
to Republicans

03:03.784 --> 03:06.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and independents and the elected
leadership
of the Congress.

03:06.853 --> 03:13.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton's day
today wasn't
about hopscotching.

03:13.093 --> 03:18.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was just one big event, in
critical
North Carolina with one of her
biggest surrogates

03:18.298 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on stage with her.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton pushed her new plan to
fight bullies.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The
young woman I
met in Iowa who told me she was
bullied because

03:25.639 --> 03:27.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of her asthma.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This has got to stop.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't think of anything
more important
than making sure every single
one of our children

03:34.247 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knows they are loved just as
they are.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michelle Obama!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:40.821 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And then the
candidate introduced
the first lady.

03:44.758 --> 03:49.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: So,
when you hear
folks talking about a global
conspiracy, and

03:49.963 --> 03:55.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that this election is
rigged, understand
that they are trying to get you
to stay home.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Make no mistake about it.

03:58.672 --> 04:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Casting our vote is the ultimate
way we go
high when they go low.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Voting is our high.

04:04.945 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's not the
final week,
but, in stump speeches and in
campaign ads,

04:10.217 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the final arguments are
beginning.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attack on a school.

05:24.191 --> 05:28.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The statute for the
International Criminal
Court makes that absolutely
clear that this

05:28.828 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, under their view, a war
crime when a school
is targeted.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House blamed Russia
and Syria for the attack, but
the Kremlin

05:37.137 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

that netted
more than $300 million.

06:11.838 --> 06:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

payments of allegedly
outstanding taxes or
other fees.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Many of the victims in this case

successful, and law-abiding
people.

06:30.690 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These scammers in this case, and
in so many
cases like this, are convincing.

06:34.894 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are menacing and they are
ruthless in
their pursuit of their victims.

06:39.799 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They convey authority and a

to leave voluntarily.

07:04.791 --> 07:09.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

and much more.

07:55.408 --> 08:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you just
heard, there are
new allegations coming out today
of sexual

08:02.949 --> 08:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assault aimed at Supreme Court
Justice Clarence
Thomas.

08:07.087 --> 08:11.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, who is the chief
Washington
correspondent for "The National
Law Journal"

08:11.591 --> 08:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a "NewsHour" regular, she
broke the story,
and she joins us now.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marcia, welcome to the program.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Thanks, Judy.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you cover the
Supreme Court.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did this come
to your attention?

08:22.068 --> 08:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, the evening
of the day
that all of us were reading
about Donald Trump's

08:26.773 --> 08:34.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audiotape in which he talked
about how he
treated women, Moira Smith, who
is a lawyer

08:34.147 --> 08:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and executive at a natural gas
company in
Alaska, put a post on her
Facebook page in

08:42.622 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which she recounted three
instances of inappropriate
touching, even sexual assault,
in her life.

08:50.730 --> 08:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the incidents that
she mentioned
involved Justice Clarence
Thomas.

08:56.136 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in 1999, when she was just
shy of her
24th birthday, she was a Truman
Foundation

09:03.243 --> 09:08.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scholar here in Washington,
D.C., and she
was at a dinner party hosted by
her boss at

09:08.915 --> 09:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time at the foundation, and
Justice Thomas
was there with some other
guests.

09:14.521 --> 09:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She claimed that he groped her
at that dinner.

09:18.291 --> 09:25.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A friend of hers sent a copy of
the Facebook
post to me in a private Twitter
message.

09:25.932 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after discussing it with my
editors, we
felt we should open the line of
communication

09:31.638 --> 09:33.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with her.

09:33.306 --> 09:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I called her, with no commitment
to publish
anything, to see if she wanted
to talk.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She didn't seek us out, and we
didn't go hunting
for her.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you say this
was a dinner
party.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It involved the group that she
was part of.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her employer was having the
dinner.

09:49.689 --> 09:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did she happen to be next
to, be adjacent
to the justice?

09:55.061 --> 09:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: She was called a
resident scholar.

09:57.564 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was spending a year in which
she basically
helped the foundation with its
activities.

10:03.470 --> 10:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of her unofficial
duties was to be
at these dinner parties that the
director

10:10.577 --> 10:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the foundation used to
network.

10:12.679 --> 10:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a special dinner in
which the foundation
was planning to give an award to
a Kansas

10:18.952 --> 10:20.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state legislator.

10:20.753 --> 10:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Justice Thomas was invited
because he
was going to give the award the
next day at

10:25.124 --> 10:27.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Supreme Court.

10:27.060 --> 10:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She claims that she was there
doing preparations
and doing final setting of the
table for the

10:34.334 --> 10:36.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dinner.

10:36.169 --> 10:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the guests, she said,
were in the
kitchen with her boss, who was a
gourmet chef.

10:41.307 --> 10:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she was setting the table
next to the
justice is when she claims that
he reached

10:46.579 --> 10:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out and grabbed her with his
right arm about
five to six inches below the
waste and squeezed

10:54.754 --> 10:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her several times while asking
her where was
she going to sit.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thought she should sit next
to him.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She eventually broke away.

11:03.596 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, that night,
she didn't
say anything to anyone at the
party.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: No.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she did
later?

11:10.970 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, based on my
conversations
that we had almost daily, I --
while listening

11:15.608 --> 11:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to her, I also began to report
out to see
if there was any corroboration.

11:20.246 --> 11:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I so found that she had had
three roommates,
housemates that summer, in D.C.,
and I found

11:26.653 --> 11:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them and interviewed each of
them individually.

11:29.789 --> 11:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though they were fuzzy
-- I mean,
it's been a long time on the
actual details

11:34.594 --> 11:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what she said -- they all
remembered her
telling them about inappropriate
behavior

11:39.432 --> 11:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the justice and how they
really just didn't
know what to do.

11:43.269 --> 11:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also found a fourth person who
was a scholar
that summer who also remembered
her telling

11:48.274 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him about the incident shortly
afterwards.

11:50.843 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Marcia, you
have asked
the justice about this.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I approached the
-- my editors
and I thought we had enough to
approach him

12:00.019 --> 12:01.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Tuesday.

12:01.788 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I walked the letter over to
the court
public information office, in
which I told

12:06.292 --> 12:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him specifically what she was
claiming in
her own words.

12:11.030 --> 12:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then later that evening, I
followed up
with a series of questions.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He finally did get back to us
late Wednesday
afternoon.

12:18.972 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at that point, he had just
one sentence
in response.

12:23.376 --> 12:27.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said, "The claim is
preposterous and it
never happened."

12:27.313 --> 12:32.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are you
aware, Marcia,
of any other allegations
involving Justice

12:32.752 --> 12:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas, other than the Anita
Hill original...

12:35.655 --> 12:36.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:36.656 --> 12:38.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: No.

12:38.458 --> 12:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said in the story, there
have been no
other public allegations against
the justice

12:42.228 --> 12:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the Anita Hill hearings in
1991.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does
this go from
here?

12:46.733 --> 12:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I think people
should read the
story.

12:50.670 --> 12:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I often say here on the
"NewsHour" when
I talk about decisions, I try to
give as much

12:55.408 --> 13:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information as possible, so that
people can
make up their own minds about
what the court

13:00.313 --> 13:01.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has done.

13:01.748 --> 13:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a thoroughly reported
and carefully
edited story.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just suggest they read it
and make their
own decision.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we will see.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There has been some reaction.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The justice has very loyal
supporters.

13:14.060 --> 13:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have come -- some of them
have come forward
with very skeptical comments
about the story.

13:19.732 --> 13:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle with
"The National
Law Journal," thank you for
coming to talk

13:24.003 --> 13:25.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to us about it.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Thank you, Judy.

13:27.206 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to the allegations
that Donald Trump, and some of
his surrogates,

13:32.345 --> 13:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have not only alienated, but
declared war
on women this election cycle,
this on a day

13:37.684 --> 13:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when another woman has come
forward to accuse
Trump of groping her, bringing
the total number

13:43.322 --> 13:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of accusers now to at least 12.

13:45.725 --> 13:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The former Miss Finland in the
2006 Miss Universe
Pageant charges that he grabbed
her from behind

13:52.498 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as they were being photographed
together.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
What we want to do is to
replenish the Social

13:57.870 --> 13:59.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Security Trust Fund...

13:59.205 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Such a nasty woman.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The "nasty woman"
interjection
at the last debate, Donald Trump
standing

14:03.876 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right behind Hillary Clinton
during the second
debate, the "Access Hollywood"
audiotape from

14:09.982 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2005 in which he boasted of
groping women.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And when you're a
star they
let you do it.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILLY BUSH, "Access Hollywood":
Whatever you
want.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Grab them by the
(WORD DELETED).

14:19.425 --> 14:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And subsequent
allegations
by women who say Trump grabbed
or inappropriately

14:23.896 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kissed them in the past.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all taking a toll.

14:28.067 --> 14:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A poll by the Public Religion
Research Institute
found evangelical Christian
women, in particular,

14:34.474 --> 14:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are breaking away; 58 percent
support Trump,
compared to 77 percent who voted
for Mitt

14:41.047 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Romney in 2012.

14:42.682 --> 14:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, a third of Republican
women in Congress
have defected from Trump.

14:48.588 --> 14:52.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the nominee's male
surrogates are on the
offensive.

14:52.125 --> 14:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich
scolded FOX News anchor Megyn
Kelly.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
You are fascinated with sex, and
you don't

14:59.866 --> 15:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care about public policy.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY, FOX News: Me,
really?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH: That's what I get
out of watching
you tonight.

15:04.337 --> 15:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY: You know what, Mr.
Speaker, I
am not fascinated by sex, but I
am fascinated

15:09.442 --> 15:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the protection of women and
understanding
what we're getting in the Oval
Office.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEWT GINGRICH: OK.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY: And I think the
American voters
would like to know...

15:17.517 --> 15:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH: And, therefore,
we are going
to send Bill Clinton back to the
East Wing,

15:19.418 --> 15:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, after all, you are
worried about
sexual predators.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The exchange
elicited praise
from Trump yesterday.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We don't play
games, Newt, right?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't play games.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the Clinton
campaign is
hoping to capitalize.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I would look her
right in that
fat ugly face of hers.

15:34.367 --> 15:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Using Trump's own
language
about women in ads that show
young girls looking

15:39.572 --> 15:40.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the mirror.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, in North Carolina,
the candidate
had this to say:

15:44.744 --> 15:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I wish I
didn't have
to say this, but, indeed,
dignity and respect

15:52.852 --> 15:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for women and girls is also on
the ballot
in this election.

15:58.257 --> 16:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, less than
two weeks from
Election Day, several polls show
Clinton leading

16:03.896 --> 16:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among women by even more than
President Obama's
11-point margin four years ago.

16:11.370 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To explore what's behind some of
those numbers
and the fears from some
Republicans that their

16:16.342 --> 16:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party may be alienating female
voters for
years to come, we are joined by
Missy Shorey,

16:22.782 --> 16:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
executive director of Maggie's
List.

16:24.717 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a political action group
that works to
elect conservative women to
Congress.

16:29.255 --> 16:35.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Christine Matthews, she is a
Republican
pollster and president of
Bellwether Research.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

16:37.463 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Christine
Matthews.

16:39.799 --> 16:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone you know, I'm sure,
Nicolle Wallace,
tweeted this week -- and I'm
quoting -- she

16:43.903 --> 16:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said: "Republicans are engaged
in a hot war,"
her words, "against women that
will end badly

16:50.409 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the party."

16:52.011 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you see what's going on
right now?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS, President,
Bellwether
Research: I agree.

16:56.082 --> 17:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole tenor and tone of this
campaign
has been one in which women
voters have been

17:01.921 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
casualties.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, you know, we have
really turned off
women.

17:04.824 --> 17:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the gains that we made
as a party
in 2014 sort of on the heels of
recovering

17:10.563 --> 17:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 2012, where two Senate
candidates unfortunately
used rape analogies in very
unfortunate ways,

17:17.403 --> 17:19.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have made progress.

17:19.272 --> 17:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this election cycle, we
have completely
regressed, and we're going to --
I think we're

17:23.910 --> 17:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to see a historic gender
gap in the
lines of 20-plus points.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say "we
have regressed,"
what are you referring to?

17:31.384 --> 17:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: What I mean,
is, you know,
the -- basically, the Democrats
have always

17:36.155 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, you know, Republicans are
waging a war
on women.

17:39.792 --> 17:44.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that we started in
2014 to have
conversations that moved us past
that.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, we had the unfortunate
comments in
2012 about rape.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: And, in
2014, I think
we had some constructive
conversations.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won Senate races in most of
our battleground
state.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we had sort of moved beyond
that.

17:57.443 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now not only are we seen as
not sort of
modern or with the era.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're seen as completely
regressive cavemen,
actually.

18:07.386 --> 18:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean because
of comments
by Donald Trump, by other
Republican men supporting

18:13.726 --> 18:15.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him?

18:15.061 --> 18:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: I think
because of Donald
Trump primarily.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He set the tone for this.

18:18.264 --> 18:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He set it in the primary when he
attacked
Carly Fiorina's face and said,
you know, "Look

18:22.501 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at that face.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that presidential?"

18:24.503 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it went downhill from there.

18:26.305 --> 18:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that we have
seen a lot
of Republican men stepping up
and saying this

18:30.876 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- they have said it's
unacceptable.

18:32.878 --> 18:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem is, and the rub,
is, in many
cases, they're still supporting
Donald Trump.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the women in the
party feel very,
I have to say betrayed, yes.

18:41.721 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Missy Shorey, as
a woman in
the Republican Party, how do you
see all this?

18:47.693 --> 18:49.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MISSY SHOREY, Executive
Director, Maggie's
List: Well, thank you, Judy.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a very important
conversation.

18:51.831 --> 18:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way that we really need
to look at
it is, this is a raw moment in
politics.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't have a perfect
candidate.

18:57.937 --> 19:02.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the end of the day, this
election is
really going to come down to our
future.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a pocketbook issue.

19:04.377 --> 19:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an issue where families
and women and
children deserve to have more
opportunity

19:09.482 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, quite frankly, much more
responsible
government.

19:12.651 --> 19:17.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in many ways, the
conversation, the dialogue
we're having today is so
distracting, because

19:17.690 --> 19:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the real issues at hand are
being utterly
ignored.

19:20.292 --> 19:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
that you
don't take seriously the
concerns about what

19:26.599 --> 19:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump said in that
audiotape, the "Access
Hollywood" tape, and the
accusations by the

19:31.604 --> 19:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women who have come forward?

19:32.905 --> 19:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: Absolutely, Judy,
everyone takes
it seriously.

19:37.009 --> 19:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone is concerned, and
everyone knows
that that behavior is not
acceptable.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump has apologized, and I
have accepted
his apology.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as a result, many people
do.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is a tough year.

19:50.156 --> 19:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are going to have to
look and say,
where do they want the future of
the party

19:53.459 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be?

19:54.927 --> 19:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they want our values of less
government
and opportunity to go away?

19:58.130 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we want issues of security to
be taken
off the table?

20:01.367 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, essentially, we're
doing -- we're
looking at a terrible personal
behavior, as

20:07.473 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposed to really looking at the
policies
taking us forward.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what's going to keep
the party
going.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Christine is absolutely
right.

20:13.612 --> 20:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very tough time for
us, but it's
very important we stand up for
our own values.

20:19.185 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Matthews, what she's
saying is, the pocketbook
economic issues

20:23.456 --> 20:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are more important than any of
this.

20:25.157 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: I don't
think -- well,
I would respectfully disagree.

20:30.696 --> 20:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what Donald Trump
has done, the
tone that he has set for this
campaign has

20:35.568 --> 20:41.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been so damaging, that it's very
difficult
to have a conversation about
pocketbook issues.

20:41.941 --> 20:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so over the top, it's so
distracting,
it's so disrespectful.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I, for one, am not beyond that.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For me -- and I think every
woman has to struggle
with this.

20:51.817 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every Republican consultant that
I know, every
woman, this is all we talk
about, how difficult

20:57.423 --> 21:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is, how stressful this is,
how, you know
-- with two other women
consultants, I started

21:04.697 --> 21:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a firm that was supposed to help
us talk to
Republican women, or all women,
really.

21:09.935 --> 21:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we feel like we have been
almost slapped
in the face by this kind of
conversation that

21:14.240 --> 21:15.441 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're having.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, I'm not going to be
supporting
Donald Trump.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I never was and I never will.

21:19.812 --> 21:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question for myself and
other Republican
consultants, other women voters
is, then what?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you do?

21:26.886 --> 21:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not like there's a full
embrace of Hillary
Clinton on the Republican side.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Republican women don't
like her
either.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So then the question is, what do
you do?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me come
back to Missy
Shorey.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You hear what she is -- you hear
what Christine
is saying, that when Republican
women get

21:41.367 --> 21:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together, they can't get past
what has happened
in this campaign.

21:45.504 --> 21:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: Well, maybe some
people, that's
their case, and maybe that's
kind of a mind-set

21:49.842 --> 21:51.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a consultant.

21:51.510 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for those of us who are
grassroots activists,
we have to respect democracy.

21:55.514 --> 21:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Millions of people came out and
voted in the
primaries on a level they never
have before.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as a result, there is
something there.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a chord that Donald
Trump has touched
on.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, do I share her concerns on
many levels?

22:08.127 --> 22:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I do, and I think every
woman does.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is not going to be the
only issue
that's here.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We really need to look at the
bigger picture.

22:16.068 --> 22:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to look at -- and I also
say, let's
elect more women to office, so
we have more

22:20.806 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
options going forward.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's look at the future of
what's there.

22:24.577 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will tell you that when I
speak with
my other Republican women, yes,
this comes

22:28.147 --> 22:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, but it's not the only thing
we're talking
about.

22:30.916 --> 22:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about many things,
in terms
of, do we want a culture of
corruption going

22:34.853 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward that we have seen with
the Clinton
White House and we will see in
the next one?

22:38.857 --> 22:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do we want a situation where
we can have
opportunity, we can have
economic prosperity

22:43.829 --> 22:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we can have security?

22:45.664 --> 22:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are things that are
important, and that
we can get the kind of Supreme
Court that

22:48.934 --> 22:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need for this country to
protect our constitutional
rights that just have not been
brought there.

22:54.473 --> 22:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are things that people are
having a
hard time getting into and past
because of

22:59.111 --> 23:00.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the issues at hand.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are serious, but they're
not the only
issues.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Matthews, what about
her comment that, well,
consultants may feel

23:05.584 --> 23:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this way, but we're out here in
the trenches?

23:07.653 --> 23:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: Well, OK,
so, I am a consultant,
but I also do research among
women voters.

23:11.690 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to say that women
voters are expressing
despair.

23:15.928 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican women voters,
independent women
voters, I'm seeing words used
like despair,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agony.

23:22.167 --> 23:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are very unhappy with what
they have
seen in terms of how Donald
Trump has talked

23:26.505 --> 23:28.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about women.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not just like the
professional class
in D.C. that is concerned about
this.

23:31.644 --> 23:32.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My friends here are, but so are
the voters.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So are women that I talk to as
part of my
research every day.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this getting
resolved?

23:40.452 --> 23:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to ask both of you this
question.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: Yes.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I am concerned,
actually.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the Republican roster is
going to
shrink.

23:46.859 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a number of women who
worked in this
field, who have worked in this
field for decades

23:50.262 --> 23:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to declare themselves
free agents.

23:52.364 --> 23:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going to say, a
party that basically
rejected other qualified
candidates and is

23:58.270 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporting Donald Trump, a party
who, you
know, we're seeing, because of
Donald Trump,

24:02.941 --> 24:09.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, Vladimir Putin's
favorability is
rising, Paul Ryan's shrinking.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where is my role in this?

24:11.450 --> 24:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think you are going to
see a number
of women say, my time and talent
are worth

24:15.287 --> 24:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something, and I'm not sure this
is something
I'm going to continue to do.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Missy Shorey, how
do you see
this getting resolved?

24:20.426 --> 24:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: I think the
ultimate resolution
is for us to really look and
say, what do

24:24.196 --> 24:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we stand for as individuals, as
Americans,
and where do we see the future
of this country,

24:30.202 --> 24:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really standing up for
policies and programs,
for example, the better way that
Paul Ryan

24:34.840 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has put forward, and the first
100 days of
what Donald Trump has said.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is he a perfect candidate?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the reality is, we have to
weigh the future
of our country with this.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think we have a lot of
soul-searching
to do as a party.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christine is absolutely right.

24:49.788 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the issue is, do we let
other people define
who we are as a party, or do we
embrace our

24:55.461 --> 24:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
principles, move forward and
relentlessly
advocate for them?

24:59.865 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we -- I
know that both
of you are going to be
continuing to think

25:03.402 --> 25:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about this hard until Election
Day and beyond.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Missy Shorey, we thank you.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christine Matthews, thank you
for joining
us.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE MATTHEWS: Thank you.

25:11.076 --> 25:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To another
political story
today.

25:15.080 --> 25:21.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hacked Clinton campaign
e-mails published
by the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks
are providing

25:21.186 --> 25:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new details on an issue that's
been dogging
Hillary Clinton for some time,
and that is

25:25.958 --> 25:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the relationship between the
charitable Clinton
Foundation and the Clinton's
personal wealth.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To put it in all context, here's
John Yang.

25:33.799 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton has
said job one
after she and her husband left
the White House

25:38.504 --> 25:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 1997 was making money.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She talked about it in a 2014
ABC News interview.

25:43.742 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We had no money when we got
there, and we

25:48.247 --> 25:54.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggled to, you know, piece
together the
resources for mortgages for
houses, for Chelsea's

25:54.686 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it wasn't easy.

25:57.589 --> 26:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, we had to pay off
all our debts,
which was -- you know, you had
to make double

26:00.893 --> 26:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money because of, obviously,
taxes, and
pay off the debt and get us
houses and take

26:05.898 --> 26:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care of family members.

26:07.766 --> 26:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now documents and
messages in stolen
Clinton campaign e-mails suggest
the Clinton

26:12.304 --> 26:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foundation may have been part of
that.

26:15.140 --> 26:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're written by Doug Band, a
White House
aide to Bill Clinton, a central
figure at

26:20.078 --> 26:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Clinton Foundation and
creator of the
annual Clinton Global Initiative
meetings.

26:25.551 --> 26:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In November 2011, he wrote a
memo describing
the intersection of his
foundation fund-raising

26:30.956 --> 26:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts and his management of
President Clinton's
for-profit business
opportunities, which Band

26:37.129 --> 26:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called Bill Clinton, Inc.

26:39.965 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the for-profit
Laureate International
Universities, which gave the
foundation more

26:45.204 --> 26:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than $1 million, Band called it
a foundation
relationship that evolved into a
personal

26:51.043 --> 26:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisory services business
relationship for
President Clinton.

26:55.247 --> 27:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton made more than $17
million over five
years as a consultant and
honorary chancellor.

27:01.353 --> 27:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UBS Wealth Management gave the
foundation
more than a half-million
dollars.

27:05.991 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Band said his firm encouraged
UBS to invite
President Clinton to give
several paid speeches,

27:11.663 --> 27:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which he has done, Clinton's
fees, $900,000,
or GEMS Education, which gave
$780,000.

27:21.340 --> 27:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Band said the relationship has
grown into
a business relationship for
President Clinton.

27:26.078 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Band wrote the memo as part of
an internal
audit which began after Chelsea
Clinton accused

27:31.450 --> 27:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him of hustling business at CGI
meetings.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It appears to have triggered
some personal
hostility.

27:38.490 --> 27:44.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In November 2011, Band
complained that she
was acting like a spoiled brat
kid who has

27:44.062 --> 27:46.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing else to do.

27:46.131 --> 27:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also evidence that the
Clinton campaign
was concerned about the
foundation's activities.

27:51.303 --> 27:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In June 2015, campaign manager
Robby Mook
wrote campaign chairman John
Podesta: "Do

27:57.142 --> 27:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they plan to do big events next
year?

27:59.678 --> 28:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Possible for those to be smaller
and lower-key
in '16?"

28:03.315 --> 28:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a Clinton campaign
spokesman wouldn't
confirm the authenticity of the
e-mails, which

28:08.587 --> 28:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said were hacked by the
Russian government
to influence the election by
weaponizing WikiLeaks.

28:14.693 --> 28:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

28:19.898 --> 28:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: new rules
for broadband
providers when it comes to
collecting and

28:31.577 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sharing customer data.

28:33.412 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Federal Communications
Commission voted
for the first time today to
create protections

28:37.115 --> 28:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the transmission of personal
information
from broadband providers.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tom Wheeler is the chairman of
the FCC.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he joins me now.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is a provider going to have
to do under
these new rules?

28:47.025 --> 28:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER, Chairman, Federal
Communications
Commission: Well, the key thing
is that it

28:49.728 --> 28:51.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the consumers' information.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not the network's
information.

28:53.665 --> 29:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the consumer now has the
choice to say
how they want that information
to be used

29:00.572 --> 29:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and if they want it to be used.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there are really three key
things.

29:05.177 --> 29:10.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One, there has to be
transparency, that the
consumers have to be told,
here's what we're

29:10.749 --> 29:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing with your information.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Two, they have to have choice.

29:14.486 --> 29:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, do you want to opt in or opt
out of this
kind of service?

29:18.523 --> 29:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, three, that data, when it's
stored someplace,
has to be stored securely and
consumers have

29:24.396 --> 29:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to know if there is some kind of
data breach.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you have
also expanded
the definition of what is
sensitive data.

29:29.701 --> 29:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some businesses have pushed
back, saying,
the browsing history, the app
usage, Internet

29:34.906 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies like Facebook and
Google, they already
have all that, and you're
placing undue burdens

29:39.311 --> 29:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on companies like Verizon, AT&amp;T,
et cetera.

29:42.114 --> 29:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER: But what we're
talking about
is not the fact that you may go
to a dozen

29:47.919 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sites that each will get a
little bit of information.

29:51.590 --> 29:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about the network
that takes
you to every site and knows
everything you're

29:57.229 --> 29:58.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's the big difference.

29:59.931 --> 30:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hire the network to deliver
you to those
sites.

30:05.537 --> 30:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't hire the network to
take your information
without your permission and turn
around and

30:11.677 --> 30:13.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
resell it.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, businesses
are also
saying, listen, this is part of
our marketing.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our -- how we actually make
money is off of
this consumer data.

30:20.452 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you do this, if the FCC
does this,
what about if the consumer gets
charged more,

30:27.059 --> 30:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost a privacy fee, a tax, if
I want to
stay private?

30:30.495 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER: Well, let's go back
to the fact
that nothing says that they
can't use this

30:34.566 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information, just that they have
to ask permission,
OK?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's step one.

30:39.504 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Step two is that pay for privacy
-- we don't
want privacy to become some kind
of a luxury

30:46.511 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
item, but we ought to look at
that on a case-by-case
basis in terms of, how does any
policies that

30:55.687 --> 31:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affect pricing, what are the
specifics of
those, rather than looking at
them on some

31:00.292 --> 31:01.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of a broad basis.

31:01.993 --> 31:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, right
now, this is
limited to kind of broadband
providers.

31:05.630 --> 31:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of companies now
who are more
than just a broadband provider.

31:09.634 --> 31:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also own content creators,
so they do
both the distribution and the
creation.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:15.974 --> 31:18.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what about the fact that if
I'm with AT&amp;T,
there is also the satellite,
there is also

31:18.477 --> 31:23.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cell phone, there is also
all kinds of
things where my data could be
stored, transmitted?

31:24.015 --> 31:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This just seems to just cover a
small sliver.

31:25.951 --> 31:34.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM WHEELER: So, if your
communications company
is engaged -- has other
communications activities,

31:34.459 --> 31:36.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they can share the information.

31:36.328 --> 31:42.234 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
But if they have
non-communications activities,
such as their own Web site and
-- or they're

31:42.267 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking you to other Web sites,
that information
is your information, and it's
not information

31:48.807 --> 31:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have the ability to
turn around
and sell without your
permission.

31:52.410 --> 32:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What have you
learned now,
looking back five years ago, the
merger of

32:00.152 --> 32:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comcast or the acquisition of
NBC by Comcast?

32:03.622 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not on your desk yet, but
more likely
than not AT&amp;T is trying to buy
Time Warner,

32:08.894 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's going to show up in the
FCC.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What have you learned in those
past five years
of what worked and what didn't
work?

32:13.899 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what would you differently?

32:14.900 --> 32:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER: Well, you're right.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not on our desk yet.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't know what the
parameters are.

32:19.704 --> 32:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what our job is, is to
develop the
facts of the case, and to make a
decision

32:25.877 --> 32:28.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based on those facts.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think what's more
important is to say,
five years is a long tame.

32:31.750 --> 32:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at specifically
what's happening
today, what the marketplace
looks like today.

32:37.155 --> 32:41.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's make a decision based
on that, if,
in fact, this ends up on our
plate.

32:41.359 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, is there
something that
you can say that, you know what,
these kind

32:46.364 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of restrictions didn't pan out,
or these restrictions
that are only going to be in
place until,

32:51.403 --> 32:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's say, 2018, if that's what
the structure
of that deal was, they need to
be changed

32:55.607 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because the market has changed
so much already?

32:57.542 --> 33:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER: Well, first, you
have to say,
what are the specific
circumstances in the

33:04.583 --> 33:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
item that you're looking at
right then, and
then go from there.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't have that basis
yet.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

33:11.323 --> 33:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, you have had a lot come
on your plate,
reclassifying broadband as a
utility, net

33:15.093 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neutrality.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you came in, you came
from the cable
industry.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people said, well, look at
this, he's
going to give them a free pass.

33:21.433 --> 33:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has being on this job changed
how you think
about these things, especially
considering

33:26.371 --> 33:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the public comments that you
see and hear?

33:27.939 --> 33:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM WHEELER: Well, that is a
really interesting
question, Hari.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think I'm always -- I'm
the same person
that I always was.

33:33.011 --> 33:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My career has been representing
the insurgents
against the incumbents.

33:40.185 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was always for the folks who
were bringing
more competition.

33:44.155 --> 33:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the mantra of my term at the
FCC has been
competition, competition,
competition.

33:48.293 --> 33:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Tom
Wheeler,
chairman of the FCC, thanks for
joining us.

33:56.067 --> 34:00.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM WHEELER: Thank you.

34:00.438 --> 34:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

34:03.508 --> 34:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
young Minnesota
boy chosen to become a great
Buddhist leader;

34:09.581 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and chef Anthony Bourdain
explains his hunger
for new adventures.

34:14.052 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Much of this election
campaign
has focused on worries over
stagnation and

34:19.991 --> 34:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether the country is heading
in the right
direction.

34:22.327 --> 34:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, a conversation that
takes a much
longer view about the price, and
paradox of

34:28.066 --> 34:30.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the country's historical
prosperity.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman has
our look.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ, Author, "The
Price of Prosperity:
Why Rich Nations Fail and How to
Renew Them":

34:37.509 --> 34:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, D.C., is a beautiful
city, Greek,
Roman architecture.

34:42.047 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our society is based on those
empires, but
they're gone.

34:45.517 --> 34:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why do we think that our
country is going
to defy all of human history?

34:51.189 --> 34:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because empires,
asserts Republican
economist Todd Buchholz, are so
often forced

34:57.028 --> 34:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to pay the price of prosperity.

34:59.564 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: They undermine
themselves,
and they do that by racking up
more debt,

35:06.104 --> 35:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by having fewer babies born, by
more regulation.

35:10.075 --> 35:13.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's difficult to keep up
patriotism as
time goes by.

35:13.511 --> 35:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: "The Price of
Prosperity" is
Buchholz's downbeat new book, a
dissonant

35:18.650 --> 35:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contrast to its upbeat author.

35:22.354 --> 35:29.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Buchholz was an original
investor in the musical
mega-hit "Jersey Boys," author
of the bestselling

35:29.894 --> 35:34.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"New Ideas From Dead
Economists," director
of economic policy under
President George

35:34.833 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
H.W. Bush, pushing economic
growth optimistically.

35:38.737 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he rails at what we have
become, a people
that want everything, but won't
pay for it

35:46.344 --> 35:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves, and, thus, in the
first of his
symptoms of prosperity malaise,
have run up

35:52.784 --> 35:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a $19 trillion national debt.

35:56.554 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And how exactly?

35:57.655 --> 36:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: Because people
will lend to
us.

36:00.692 --> 36:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the U.S. is a rich
country, we don't
seem to have the need yet to
discipline ourselves.

36:05.897 --> 36:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But in the future,
there will
be fewer Americans to cough up
the taxes to

36:10.669 --> 36:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay the debt, our fertility
having fallen
below the replacement rate for
the first time

36:16.841 --> 36:18.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our history.

36:18.076 --> 36:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Low fertility is Buchholz's
symptom number
two.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: This was a
hospital.

36:24.315 --> 36:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is where my kids were born.

36:25.717 --> 36:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lots of D.C. kids were born
here, but it's
not a hospital anymore.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's condos.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, throughout the world,
throughout
history, when countries get
rich, they stop

36:35.293 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
having kids.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because Who needs
them?

36:38.363 --> 36:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: Rich countries
don't need as
many children.

36:41.533 --> 36:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used to need kids to work in
the fields
as farm hands, to crawl on their
bellies into

36:46.438 --> 36:47.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coal mines.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, kids are more like luxury
objects now.

36:50.909 --> 36:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the richer we
get, the fewer
kids we have, but is that a bad
thing?

36:57.015 --> 37:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: You need somebody
to support
the retirees.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need to pay into the pension
plans.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need people to work at the
hospitals,
at the nursing homes.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you haven't produced enough
babies to do
that...

37:10.528 --> 37:16.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You need
immigration, supposed
symptom number three.

37:16.468 --> 37:21.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: It was a
tremendous advantage
for the United States for most
of the 20th

37:21.406 --> 37:23.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
century.

37:23.141 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if you have waves of
immigration, you
better figure out a way to turn
those immigrants

37:26.544 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into red-blooded Americans, or
else you end
up splintering the society.

37:31.749 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Look at today's
anti-immigrant
backlash, says Buchholz, against
those who

37:36.821 --> 37:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn very little English,
practice a different
religion, come here illegally,
like, we were

37:43.695 --> 37:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told, some of these day laborers
from Mexico
and Central America.

37:48.666 --> 37:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They shape up at the parking lot
next to our
"NewsHour" headquarters in
Arlington, Virginia,

37:55.073 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hoping for the most basic work.

37:57.442 --> 38:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luis Hernandez gets hired two to
three days
a week, he says, at $15 an hour
and up.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LUIS HERNANDEZ, Day Laborer:
Renovation.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Renovation.

38:07.685 --> 38:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUIS HERNANDEZ: Renovation.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Renovation, yes, kitchen,
bathroom, the floors.

38:11.389 --> 38:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hernandez sends
money back to
his family in Guatemala.

38:16.794 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jose Reyes sends money back to
Honduras to
support his wife and three kids.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much do you send back?

38:23.501 --> 38:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSE REYES, Day Laborer: Maybe
$500 or $600.

38:25.570 --> 38:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: I admire these
men for working
so hard on behalf of their wives
and their

38:30.141 --> 38:31.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when they're doing the work
and then sending
the money back home, we do have
to ask, does

38:35.213 --> 38:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that really contribute as much
to the American
economy as if they were devoted
to actually

38:40.185 --> 38:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being here and staying here?

38:42.153 --> 38:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But there are
immigrants serving
as doctors in hospitals,
professors at universities.

38:50.995 --> 38:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They come, they stay, they
contribute, no?

38:55.433 --> 39:00.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: It's a good thing
we have immigrant
doctors and immigrant engineers,
because if

39:00.438 --> 39:04.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you or I get sick this
afternoon, we're going
to go to the hospital, and we're
going to

39:04.475 --> 39:06.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hope someone serves us.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But these workers
are doing work
almost anyone could do,
illustrating a fourth

39:10.848 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
price of prosperity: As a
country gets richer,
claims Buchholz, its work ethic
tends to erode.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tony Barajas is the site's
coordinator.

39:20.959 --> 39:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why wouldn't Americans, many of
whom are still
out of work, not take jobs like
this, where

39:27.131 --> 39:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can show up and make, what,
700 bucks
a week, something like that?

39:31.102 --> 39:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY BARAJAS, Site Coordinator:
It's -- nobody
wants to do those jobs.

39:34.138 --> 39:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know it's kind of cliche
to even say
that, but that is the fact.

39:38.409 --> 39:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSE REYES: Maybe for pay is too
cheap.

39:42.046 --> 39:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it may be the job is
too hard, too,
you know?

39:48.453 --> 39:54.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And while these
guys wait for
work, many legal Americans their
age can afford

39:54.058 --> 39:55.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do otherwise.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: We're prosperous
enough that
we can afford to have one in six
able-bodied

39:59.831 --> 40:03.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men of working age sitting at
home playing
video games.

40:03.368 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Last stop on "Price
of Prosperity"
tour: Theodore Roosevelt Island,
splitting

40:09.807 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Potomac between Virginia and
D.C., and
a backdrop for Buchholz's
conclusion.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: When Teddy
Roosevelt was around,
there was an Ottoman Empire.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a Habsburg empire.

40:20.652 --> 40:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They controlled millions of
people across
Africa, the Middle East and
Europe.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're gone.

40:26.557 --> 40:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosperity killed them, because
they didn't
have a way to hold the people
together.

40:30.561 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't have the rituals and
the holidays
and the pride in their country.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what we need if we're
going to
hold ourselves together during
periods of

40:39.304 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prosperity.

40:41.139 --> 40:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Buchholz has
remedies, big
tax credits for having more
kids, bonuses

40:46.644 --> 40:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for starting to work young and
for getting
off unemployment insurance,
making immigrants

40:52.717 --> 40:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and students applying for
federal loans visit
patriotic sites like this one.

40:58.790 --> 41:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: I would require
them to get
their passport stamped, not just
at JFK or

41:04.128 --> 41:06.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whatever airport they arrive at.

41:06.064 --> 41:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would require them to go to at
least five
national monuments or museums,
maybe here

41:12.170 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Teddy Roosevelt Island, or
the Smithsonian,
or the Museum of Tolerance, to
demonstrate

41:17.375 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are trying to learn
something about
American history.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you know what?

41:22.580 --> 41:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would require the same thing
of American
students.

41:25.783 --> 41:30.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I had one final
question.

41:30.655 --> 41:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think the rancor of this
election is
symptomatic of the kind of
dissolution of

41:38.062 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America you're talking about?

41:39.664 --> 41:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD BUCHHOLZ: I think this is a
corrosive
election.

41:44.202 --> 41:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it does reflect deep
divisions
and distrust of our fellow
countrymen.

41:50.708 --> 41:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Half of Americans look at the
other half and
say, they're too lazy or they're
not willing

41:55.313 --> 41:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get up and go to school.

41:57.448 --> 42:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other half looks and
sees a bunch
of fat cats and talks about
income inequality.

42:02.253 --> 42:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hardly a new theme
in often contentious
America, but it sure seems at
odds with hopeful

42:09.260 --> 42:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctuaries of the past, like
Teddy Roosevelt
Island.

42:13.364 --> 42:18.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting from

42:18.836 --> 42:24.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington, D.C.

42:24.976 --> 42:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The tradition
of rebirth
is a central Tenet in the
Buddhist religion.

42:34.118 --> 42:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when spiritual leaders, or
lamas, die,
there's an elaborate process of
identifying

42:39.390 --> 42:41.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their reincarnation.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's usually an infant.

42:42.794 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One such young lama was
identified a few years
ago far away from his Himalayan
roots.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
from Minnesota.

42:50.701 --> 42:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They are
chants more likely
heard in a Himalayan monastery
than a working-class

42:58.676 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Minneapolis suburb.

43:02.613 --> 43:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's here in Columbia
Heights, Minnesota,
that 9-year-old Jalue Dorje
begins the day

43:07.852 --> 43:14.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a routine of Tibetan Buddhist
mantras,
coached by his father.

43:14.292 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A bit later, there are house
calls from volunteer
teachers in modern Tibetan, in
the calligraphy

43:21.866 --> 43:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the ancient scriptures.

43:23.768 --> 43:30.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THINLY WORSER, Teacher: He has
really motivation
to learn and especially -- even
I know him,

43:30.408 --> 43:33.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's tired, but he says, no, I'm
not tired.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to continue, you know?

43:35.880 --> 43:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that also motivated me also
to teach him.

43:39.217 --> 43:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's a
fitting trait,
because Jalue Dorje has been
recognized as

43:44.155 --> 43:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a reincarnation of Takshem Karma
Yongdu Choekyi
Nima, an eminent senior lama, or
spiritual

43:51.128 --> 43:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leader, who died nine years ago.

43:53.664 --> 44:00.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He would be the eighth
reincarnation of the
first Takshem lama, who lived in
the 16th

44:00.037 --> 44:02.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
century.

44:02.039 --> 44:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tibetan tradition, the
process of recognizing
a reincarnate varies, depending
on circumstances.

44:08.946 --> 44:12.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spiritual masters divine from a
variety of
signals.

44:12.350 --> 44:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of Jalue Dorje, it
was the dream
of a senior monk who had visited
Jalue's home

44:17.321 --> 44:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Minnesota, which is home to
some 3,000
Tibetan-Americans, the second in
size only

44:22.860 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to New York.

44:24.795 --> 44:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that dream, tigers roamed in
every room
of Jalue's house.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a critical clue in the
search for the
Takshem Lama's reincarnation.

44:32.937 --> 44:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THINLY WORSER: The Takshem
lamas, they used
to wear skirts of the tiger
skin.

44:39.076 --> 44:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I also thought, oh, it
might be, you
know, because Takshem lama was
passed away

44:45.349 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year before, and everybody was
trying to find
out his reincarnation.

44:50.121 --> 44:55.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The question
of whether
that reincarnation is indeed
Jalue Dorje went

44:55.393 --> 44:59.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the way up to the Dalai
Lama, spiritual
head of Tibetan Buddhism.

44:59.463 --> 45:07.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THINLY WORSER: Then His
Holiness' prediction
was the same, and many other
high lamas, and

45:07.805 --> 45:09.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so he was confirmed.

45:09.607 --> 45:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In the old
days, the boy
would be moved to a monastery in
Tibet, or

45:13.544 --> 45:19.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now in India, where the Dalai
Lama and thousands
of followers have lived in exile
since 1959.

45:19.684 --> 45:25.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, the Dalai Lama
suggested that Jalue's
monastic education be deferred
until he's

45:25.122 --> 45:27.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bit older.

45:27.058 --> 45:32.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The spiritual leader has
emphasized that Tibetans
or all Buddhists must reconcile
their traditional

45:32.163 --> 45:33.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belief system with the modern
world.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DALAI LAMA, Exiled Tibetan
Spiritual Leader:
I always appealing we Buddhists
should be

45:38.803 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
21st century Buddhists.

45:40.571 --> 45:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For Jalue
Dorje, that
means immersion in ceremony and
scripture,

45:46.143 --> 45:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on one hand, and, on the other,
a fairly typical
21st century Minnesota
upbringing.

45:51.482 --> 45:59.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soccer and swimming are favorite
pastimes,
as are more sedentary ones,
isolated in headphones

45:59.190 --> 46:02.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a laptop computer.

46:02.393 --> 46:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this will soon change
drastically in a
Himalayan monastery perhaps in a
couple of

46:07.064 --> 46:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, though an exact date has
not yet been
determined.

46:11.502 --> 46:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After about 10 years in India,
he is to return
to Minnesota as a spiritual
leader.

46:16.907 --> 46:22.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you grow older and you've
completed your
studies, what do you think
you'll be doing

46:22.847 --> 46:23.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for people?

46:24.015 --> 46:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JALUE DORJE, 9 Years Old: I will
be praying
for them.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will be chanting for them.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: When I asked
what those
chants mean, he responded after
consulting

46:32.556 --> 46:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with his dad, who sat in on our
conversation.

46:34.925 --> 46:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JALUE DORJE: It's like meanings
of how to
help, how your body works, to be
nice, to

46:44.969 --> 46:51.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JALUE DORJE: It's like meanings
of how to
help, how your body works, to be
nice, to

46:51.976 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be -- have peace.

46:53.778 --> 47:01.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Not every
young lama fully
embraces the rigorous,
altruistic calling

47:01.352 --> 47:04.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of meditation and service to
others.

47:04.255 --> 47:07.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The modern world can be filled
with distraction.

47:07.525 --> 47:12.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this adds pressure on
Jalue's parents,
who labor long hours doing
janitorial jobs

47:12.663 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Minneapolis.

47:14.465 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Devout Buddhists, they say they
were honored
and a bit awed when they learned
of the boy's

47:19.203 --> 47:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognition, something that has
even brought
them into close quarters with
the Dalai Lama.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DECHEN WANGMO, Mother of Jalue
Dorje (through
translator): It was the first
time in my 40

47:26.377 --> 47:28.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years I got to see His Holiness,
the Dalai
Lama.

47:28.813 --> 47:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is overwhelming for me,
because ordinary
people don't normally have the
opportunity

47:33.417 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to meet him.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DORJE TSEGYAL, Father of Jalue
Dorje (through
translator): I'm happy that he
has the chance

47:37.088 --> 47:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to learn about the modern world,
as well as
the Eastern spiritual wisdom,
both combined

47:41.525 --> 47:42.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right from childhood.

47:42.927 --> 47:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's going to be good.

47:44.762 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But like
every other parent
of a 9-year-old, he has
strategies, mainly

47:49.233 --> 47:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an incentive system to keep his
son on task.

47:53.270 --> 47:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time you memorize a set of
scriptures,
you get a toy at Target, like a
set of Pokemon

47:58.509 --> 47:59.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cards or something?

47:59.510 --> 48:01.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JALUE DORJE: Yes, mostly that.

48:01.378 --> 48:05.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He's
learning to strike
a balance in life, even as
ceremonial obligations

48:05.850 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are being added to his routine.

48:08.219 --> 48:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this gathering celebrating
the birthday
of the Karmapa Lama, a major
spiritual leader,

48:13.891 --> 48:17.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dorje came prepared with a book
that's popular
with grade school readers.

48:17.928 --> 48:19.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what did you bring to read
today?

48:19.930 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JALUE DORJE: "The Diary of a
Wimpy Kid: Old
School."

48:22.266 --> 48:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Did you
bring Pokemon
cards?

48:24.368 --> 48:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JALUE DORJE: I snuck them.

48:26.103 --> 48:29.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Does dad
know that?

48:29.874 --> 48:31.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JALUE DORJE: No.

48:31.609 --> 48:35.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, we
agreed to keep
it a secret between him and the
television

48:35.246 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
audience.

48:37.047 --> 48:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the record, the Pokemon
cards remained
out of sight, and Jalue Dorje
remained as

48:41.419 --> 48:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attentive as any adult through
the three-hour
ceremony.

48:45.122 --> 48:49.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Columbia Heights,
Minnesota.

48:49.894 --> 48:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

48:55.299 --> 48:57.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

48:57.067 --> 49:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a version of this report
aired on the
PBS program "Religion &amp; Ethics
Newsweekly."

49:00.838 --> 49:06.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Anthony Bourdain

49:06.377 --> 49:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

49:16.053 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people to share their passions.

49:17.855 --> 49:22.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Anthony
Bourdain, who
sheds light on kitchens around
the planet

49:22.893 --> 49:28.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for his CNN series "Parts
Unknown," and whose
book "Appetites" was released
just this week.

49:28.833 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BOURDAIN, Chef: How did
I get from,
you know, dunking breaded clams
in hot grease

49:33.804 --> 49:36.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to where I am today?

49:36.106 --> 49:43.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(EXPLETIVE DELETED) if I know.

49:44.014 --> 49:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the kind of angry,
extremely unpleasant
person I was in college.

49:50.187 --> 49:55.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually walked around campus
with nunchucks,
and I would show up at the
occasional social

49:55.492 --> 49:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
function bearing a samurai
sword.

49:57.361 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look back on that now with
some embarrassment,
but, then again, what were you
wearing in

50:02.032 --> 50:03.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the '70s?

50:03.033 --> 50:04.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wanted to become a heroin
addict.

50:04.134 --> 50:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was very proud of myself when
I first shot
up.

50:06.103 --> 50:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a vulnerable, goofy,
awkward guy whose
only success socially was to be
the baddest

50:11.508 --> 50:12.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
guy in the room.

50:12.943 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, ultimately, however, you
end up a whiny,
pathetic, needy person.

50:15.813 --> 50:22.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I learned every important lesson
that I ever
really needed in the rest of my
life as a

50:22.319 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dishwasher.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first time in my life
that I went
home respecting myself.

50:26.790 --> 50:31.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the good old, bad days, it
was definitely
a hazing period, in the European
tradition

50:31.629 --> 50:32.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyway.

50:32.796 --> 50:34.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a part of me that
kind of misses
that.

50:34.698 --> 50:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, hitting
people in the workplace
is probably not, on balance, a
good thing.

50:39.970 --> 50:44.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like food where the guiding
principle is,
you have three or four good
ingredients, and

50:44.541 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most important thing is to
just not screw
them up.

50:47.211 --> 50:49.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Treat them with a little
respect.

50:49.079 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All America who cook in their
backyard insist
on ruining a perfectly good hunk
of meat again

50:53.751 --> 50:54.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and again and again.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just leave the thing alone.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let it rest.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, food may not be the answer
to world peace,
but it's a start.

51:00.991 --> 51:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think I was thinking of Ted
Nugent.

51:03.427 --> 51:07.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find just about everything
that comes out
of his mouth violently
offensive, but we both

51:07.231 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like barbecue.

51:08.799 --> 51:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is some kind of common
ground for a discussion.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, surely, that's not a bad
thing.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The grandma rule is this.

51:16.840 --> 51:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if I'm going to grandma's house,
I will eat
what grandma puts on the plate,
and I will

51:20.978 --> 51:23.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smile and ask for seconds and
say, thank you,
grandma.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's really my problem with
vegetarians.

51:25.983 --> 51:29.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I admire, I respect your
personal lifestyle
choice.

51:29.219 --> 51:30.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Actually, I don't.

51:30.220 --> 51:31.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Screw you.

51:31.221 --> 51:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let's pretend that I do.

51:33.023 --> 51:35.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of my relationships with
people around
the world begin when I express
an interest

51:35.159 --> 51:39.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a willingness to respect
their traditions
behind what they put on my
plate.

51:39.830 --> 51:46.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if I were to sit there and
say, I don't
know, I can't -- do you have a
spinach salad,

51:46.170 --> 51:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would be interpreted as
insulting in
most cultures.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a -- both a blessing and a
curse to
me that, no matter what happens
in my life,

51:52.509 --> 51:54.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can always go back to brunch.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody wants to cook brunch.

51:57.014 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Society apparently needs people
to cook brunch,
in spite of its ridiculousness.

52:01.285 --> 52:04.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This TV thing doesn't work out,
there's always
a brunch gig.

52:04.588 --> 52:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Anthony Bourdain, and
this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on my
hunger.

52:11.495 --> 52:14.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

know him in
college.

HARI SREENIVASAN: He lost one
vegetarian viewer
right there.

52:16.767 --> 52:17.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:17.768 --> 52:19.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

On the "NewsHour" online right
now: A new
study finds that perceptions
that boys do

52:30.514 --> 52:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better than girls in math starts
in kindergarten,
despite efforts to close the
culture by encouraging

52:37.087 --> 52:39.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
greater confidence in girls.

52:39.289 --> 52:45.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, areas afflicted by
violence from Boko
Haram are now suffering a new
nightmare.

52:45.195 --> 52:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can find a photo essay of
children and
their mothers who are victims of

HARI SREENIVASAN: On Charlie
Rose tonight:
the cast of "The Crown," a new
Netflix series

52:59.143 --> 53:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the life of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II.
