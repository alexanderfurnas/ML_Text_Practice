JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We bring you the
"NewsHour"
tonight from the Wells Fargo
Center in Philadelphia,

00:11.578 --> 00:14.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
site of this week's Democratic
National Convention.

00:14.481 --> 00:19.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It's the
convention's final day,
the climax of a week of
friction, politics

00:19.386 --> 00:26.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and excitement, as Democrats
prepare to hear
tonight from their nominee,
Hillary Clinton.

00:26.159 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: as the
glass ceiling
shatters, a look at the ways
hidden sexism

00:31.231 --> 00:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is playing out this election
among some male
voters.

00:34.534 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: Benevolent sexism,
which, from
a male point of view, encourages
men to be

00:40.274 --> 00:44.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supportive of women who are in
traditional
roles, traditional gender roles,
but when

00:44.411 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women step out of that, men tend
to look at
them worse.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington.

00:49.483 --> 00:54.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will have all the
non-convention news of
the days, a shocking update on
what began

00:54.121 --> 00:57.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as an economic Cinderella story
in a depressed
corner of Vermont.

00:58.025 --> 01:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Job growth funded by a green
card program
ends in large-scale fraud.

01:01.995 --> 01:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.835 --> 01:10.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.938 --> 01:22.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's the night the
Democrats have
been building toward all week.

01:22.816 --> 01:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In just a few hours, Hillary
Clinton takes
center stage, picking up the
baton handed

01:28.121 --> 01:31.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to her last night by President
Obama.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent John Yang begins
our coverage.

01:34.027 --> 01:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Inside the Wells
Fargo Center in
Philadelphia, the stage is set
for tonight's

01:39.266 --> 01:43.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big moment, Hillary Clinton's
acceptance speech.

01:43.370 --> 01:47.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaign officials say she will
highlight
the gathering's theme: stronger
together.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER PALMIERI, Clinton
Campaign Communications
Director: This is a moment of
reckoning for

01:50.777 --> 01:55.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, and we have two paths
that we can
take, one that seeks division,
one that gives

01:55.782 --> 02:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into forces that we are facing,
whether they
are economic or social, that
could divide

02:01.922 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, vs. a path that, in working
together,
is going to make America
stronger.

02:07.694 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even though Clinton's
been in the
public eye for more than two
decades, her

02:12.032 --> 02:16.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign considers this her
introduction to
the American people.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They call her the most famous
unknown person
in America.

02:19.639 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will be preceded on the
stage by her daughter,
Chelsea.

02:25.212 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It won't be the nominee's first
time on the
convention stage this week.

02:31.551 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, she made a surprise
appearance
after President Obama's rousing
45-minute

02:36.990 --> 02:38.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
endorsement.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
That's why I can say with
confidence there

02:40.560 --> 02:49.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has never been a man or a woman,
not me, not
Bill, nobody, more qualified
than Hillary

02:49.169 --> 02:51.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton to serve as president of
the United
States of America.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:52.806 --> 02:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I hope you don't
mind, Bill,
but I was just telling the
truth, man.

02:58.578 --> 03:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Clinton's
running mate,
Virginia Senator Tim Kaine,
spoke to delegates

03:04.384 --> 03:06.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from his childhood home of
Missouri.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
We have a chance to make
history.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Hillary Clinton is
elected, that's
going to be historic.

03:11.858 --> 03:16.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's really going to be
historic is,
it's going to open up the
possibly of a whole

03:16.296 --> 03:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different class of successors,
just like when
President Obama was elected.

03:21.501 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, Republican
Donald Trump
continues to campaign, holding
rallies in

03:26.273 --> 03:28.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iowa.

03:28.075 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Earlier, in a FOX News
interview, he was in
damage control, after he
suggested yesterday

03:32.345 --> 03:37.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that Russia find tens of
thousands of e-mails
missing from Clinton's private
server.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When I'm being sarcastic with
something.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Were you being
sarcastic?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Of course I'm
being sarcastic.

03:42.189 --> 03:45.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have 33,000 e-mails
deleted.

03:45.192 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the real problem is what was
said on those
e-mails from the Democratic
National Committee.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You take a look at what was said
on those
e-mails, it's disgraceful.

03:52.332 --> 03:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Philadelphia, as
the convention
reaches its climax, police
remain on alert.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protests have been mostly
peaceful, with only
a small number of arrests.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Philadelphia.

04:05.479 --> 04:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One thing that
has been clear
this week in Philadelphia is
that this has

04:11.017 --> 04:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a week of criticism of
Donald Trump.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's take a look at that.

04:15.555 --> 04:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady:
Don't let anyone
ever tell you that this country
isn't great,

04:21.428 --> 04:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that somehow we need to make it
great again,
because this, right now, is the
greatest country

04:28.235 --> 04:29.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Earth.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
If you don't believe that this
election is

04:33.807 --> 04:41.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important, if you think you can
sit it out,
take a moment to think about the
Supreme Court

04:41.915 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justices that Donald Trump would
nominate.

04:44.351 --> 04:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (I), Former
Mayor of New
York: Bottom line is, Trump is a
risky, reckless

04:49.222 --> 04:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and radical choice, and we can't
afford to
make that choice.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:54.361 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Folks, you cannot
believe one word
that comes out of Donald Trump's
mouth.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: His cynicism is
unbounded.

05:05.005 --> 05:10.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His lack of empathy and
compassion can be
summed up in the phrase I
suspect he's most

05:10.877 --> 05:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proud of having made famous,
"You're fired."

05:14.381 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can there be pleasure in
saying, "You're
fired"?

05:19.219 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is trying to tell us he cares
about the
middle class?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Give me a break.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a bunch of malarkey.

05:27.527 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Our power doesn't
come from
some self-declared savior
promising that he

05:32.465 --> 05:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone can restore order as long
as we do things
his way.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't look to be ruled.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:41.508 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Our power -- our
power comes
from those immortal declarations
first put

05:50.917 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to paper right here in
Philadelphia all those
years ago: We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

05:56.623 --> 06:04.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that all men are created equal,
that we the
people can form a more perfect
union.

06:04.264 --> 06:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we turn to
Hillary Clinton's
strategist and pollster Joel
Benenson.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Joel joins us now.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us about that -- now that
this campaign,
this convention is almost over,
as you launch

06:16.876 --> 06:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the general election, tell
us what the
key expectations are.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON, Clinton Campaign
Adviser: For
tonight or going forward?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Going forward.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Look, I think
that we're in
the homestretch here, really.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have about 100 days to go.

06:28.255 --> 06:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The convention is the last time
you get four
days to deliver your message
unfiltered without

06:33.793 --> 06:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interference largely from your
opponent, although
Trump kind of tried a little bit
yesterday.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Interference.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: I think he
created for interference
for himself.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you want going
forward is, tonight,
you are going to see Hillary
Clinton lay out

06:44.904 --> 06:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very clear choice of two
visions for America,
one that is optimistic, one that
is rooted

06:49.676 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the beliefs that we have
always been stronger
together as a country, from the
time our founders

06:53.847 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggled to come together in
Philadelphia,
in this city, to create this
nation up and

06:58.251 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through today.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the challenges we face,
that's how
we will live up to our values
and be at our

07:03.156 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best, vs. a very dark divisive
-- divisive
vision that Donald Trump laid
out.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you have got to
drive that every
day.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you have got to talk
about how you're
going to create an economy that
works for

07:13.300 --> 07:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone, not just those at the
top, draw
a clear contrast on who can keep
America safe.

07:18.305 --> 07:23.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mr. Trump, Donald Trump,
proved this
week he can't do that with
erratic statements,

07:23.476 --> 07:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like inviting Russia to start
hacking computers.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think you drive that every
day.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what you have to do that
from here
on out, consistently show people
the differences

07:31.985 --> 07:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about where you are going to
take the country,
what your values are that are
driving you

07:35.722 --> 07:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and will shape your presidency.

07:37.590 --> 07:41.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Joel
Benenson, are you
describing an effort to be just
about as negative

07:41.094 --> 07:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
toward Donald Trump as the
Republicans are
toward Hillary Clinton?

07:43.930 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOEL BENENSON: No.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what I said is, you have
got to lay
out a choice and you have got to
do some contrast.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're doing only contrast.

07:49.836 --> 07:54.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, as you heard
President Obama
say last night, has one answer:
I alone can

07:54.107 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fix it.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got no prescriptions, no
real plans
that will create a single job,
no real plans

07:59.379 --> 08:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will raise wages in America
or educate
a single child.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Hillary Clinton has to do,
on balance,
is show people the positive,
affirmative,

08:06.886 --> 08:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uplifting vision she has, her
belief in the
way we solve our problems is by
working together,

08:12.359 --> 08:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by having each other's backs,
lifting each
other up, not tearing each other
apart.

08:16.529 --> 08:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you lean very heavily
towards the
positive, but you have to call
out your differences,

08:21.501 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly when you have got
someone, as
you're hearing at this
convention, whom even

08:25.772 --> 08:30.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats are calling a
demagogue, who are
turning away from their party,
who say -- people

08:30.477 --> 08:32.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Michael Bloomberg.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, you will hear from
another one saying
it's -- we have to put our
country ahead of

08:34.748 --> 08:35.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our party.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But here's the
thing.

08:37.584 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're banking on the idea that
talking about
the positive and personalizing
this toward

08:42.489 --> 08:48.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump will somehow
outbalance this
nervousness among a lot of
individual Americans

08:48.361 --> 08:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're not listening, that
their lives
are not doing so well.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Oh, I don't think
I said that
at all, Gwen.

08:52.699 --> 08:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in fact, what I said
is, you have
to have an affirmative vision of
how you're

08:56.469 --> 08:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to create an economy that
works for
everyone.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not being personal about
Donald Trump.

09:01.641 --> 09:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Donald Trump says to
Americans, wages
are too high, you're not going
to create an

09:06.112 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy that works for everyone
when you believe
that.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to do things that are
going to help
people get ahead in their lives.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the bulk of what we have
been talking
about throughout our primaries
is how to put

09:15.288 --> 09:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the plans in place to do that.

09:17.424 --> 09:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that Hillary Clinton
will be doing
in part in this speech and going
forward is

09:21.561 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
laying out very specific plans.

09:23.496 --> 09:27.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said in one of the speeches
she gave a
couple of weeks ago, I have got
this old-fashioned

09:27.934 --> 09:29.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you're running for
president, you have
got to tell people what you're
going to do,

09:32.138 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how you're going to get it done
and how you're
going to pay for it.

09:34.374 --> 09:39.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you back to the
Republican Convention,
I don't think it's personal to
say that, if

09:39.078 --> 09:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you ask yourself right now, what
specific
policy idea did Donald Trump put
on the table

09:44.017 --> 09:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the American people, other
than he was
going to build a wall?

09:46.653 --> 09:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you reach
-- we keep
hearing that Hillary Clinton's
biggest problem

09:51.357 --> 09:56.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- or one of her biggest
problems are white
male voters who have had not had
a college

09:56.696 --> 09:57.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education?

09:57.697 --> 09:59.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you reach them?

09:59.365 --> 10:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Look, I think the
number one
way you reach them is by showing
that you

10:01.868 --> 10:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand the lives, the
struggles that they
have been feeling, that, in
parts of this

10:05.104 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, many of those voters
feel they are
being left out of a new and
changing economy.

10:08.975 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, by the same token, we put
together a
coalition, Democrats in general.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has been part of a stronger
bloc for
Republicans for quite a while.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have never given up on them.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have talked about them.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Clinton talks about
them and has
talked about addressing their
economic concerns

10:25.358 --> 10:27.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and how they can have
good-paying jobs in
the future.

10:27.994 --> 10:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton is the only
candidate
here in this race, you have to
remember, who

10:32.098 --> 10:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really talking about creating
good-paying
jobs, and doing it not just the
old ways we

10:36.669 --> 10:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did it, by making investments in
things that
will help our country grow, and
grow together

10:41.975 --> 10:43.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and grow fairer.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, when you talk about
infrastructure, it's
not just about rebuilding roads.

10:46.379 --> 10:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about modernizing our
schools, modernizing
our power grid, investing in
clean energy

10:52.519 --> 10:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the future, which is where
we're going
to create the jobs of the
future, using technology

10:56.890 --> 10:59.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be the clean energy
superpower of the 21st
century.

10:59.826 --> 11:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joel Benenson, thank
you for -- congratulations
on your big night tonight.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Thank you.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you for
joining us.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: It's not my big
night.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the country's big night.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got Hillary Clinton as
a nominee
for president, a pioneering
woman, breaking

11:11.337 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some barriers, like the two
women I'm sitting
here with.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I like the way you
got that in.

11:14.707 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, we do.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:18.678 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Thank you.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Great.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, next, we head down to the
convention
floor, back to our own John
Yang.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John, you have been talking to
the Clinton
campaign.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are they telling you they
want to get
done tonight, besides what we
just heard from

11:27.287 --> 11:29.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Joel?

11:29.088 --> 11:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, essentially, I
have been
-- in the words of one aide I
spoke to today,

11:30.924 --> 11:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're trying to get her to
answer the question
what she's all about.

11:34.827 --> 11:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She realizes, or the campaign
realizes, that
a lot of people don't understand
what motivates

11:39.899 --> 11:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her, what's behind the causes
and issues she
cares about.

11:43.903 --> 11:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also going to be their way
to talk about
the trust issue, although they
say they're

11:48.575 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to explicitly talk
about it in that
way.

11:51.611 --> 11:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is also going to make an
appeal to independent
voters, to people who are not
Democrats, to

11:57.684 --> 12:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to come over and support her
in this fall's
election.

12:00.787 --> 12:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to do all this by
trying to
build on everything these
delegates have seen

12:06.225 --> 12:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and heard over the past three
nights, some
of the real people who came here
and gave

12:11.898 --> 12:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testimony and support of Hillary
Clinton,
talking about the things she has
done for

12:16.836 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them in her career as a senator,
in her career
as first lady and as secretary
of state.

12:23.276 --> 12:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's going to talk about those
people, and
some of them will actually be
here in the

12:27.213 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hall tonight.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joel, we know that
you're on the
-- you're -- I mean, John, you
know -- we

12:33.419 --> 12:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were just talking to someone
named John.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know you have been on the
floor.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The floor looks a little bit
different tonight.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm curious about how different
-- why that
might be.

12:42.929 --> 12:43.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we seeing?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Exactly, Gwen.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't see it quite behind
me.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they have built out the
stage a little
bit.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have cleared out an
area.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm led to believe -- I
don't know for
sure, but I'm led to believe
that there will

12:56.609 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be special guests in that area,
perhaps even
the Clinton family, perhaps even
the Kaine

13:02.348 --> 13:04.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We even saw them
rehearsing something
they called a stunt for later
tonight.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess we will just have to
sit at the
edge of our seats and see what
that's going

13:09.555 --> 13:10.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang, thank you very much.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we love
suspense.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, we go to our team of
analysts
right here in our sky booth who
will be with

13:17.130 --> 13:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us all evening, as they have
been for this
entire convention, David Brooks
of The New

13:21.601 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times, Mark Shields,
syndicated columnist,
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy, I'm going to start with
you.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't know if you were
able to hear
some of what the Clinton people
want to get

13:32.478 --> 13:34.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think they need to
get done tonight
with -- especially with Hillary
Clinton's

13:36.149 --> 13:37.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
this is her chance to -- she got
it all teed

13:39.719 --> 13:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up basically these last few
days.

13:41.454 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They set the table for her, and
now it's time
for her to finish what they
started.

13:46.659 --> 13:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's got to make the case for
herself that
nobody else can make, and for
voters to see

13:51.964 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
somebody who looks more
three-dimensional,
that's not simply a caricature
that had been

13:56.235 --> 14:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of a part of the American
dialogue for
the last 25 years, to fill in
some of the

14:00.773 --> 14:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meat we have been talking about
for these
last few days on specific
policies.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't need to be deep and
it doesn't
need to be a 65-point plan, but
just to give

14:10.550 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some concrete examples of how
this economy
is going to work for the people
that feel

14:15.888 --> 14:20.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now it's not working for
them, and then
finally to get to central
tension of this

14:20.593 --> 14:22.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a campaign where you
have Americans
now who want to see change.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she is the status quo.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can she be both status quo
and change?

14:29.435 --> 14:30.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
what do you think?

14:30.970 --> 14:32.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does she have to do
tonight?

14:32.672 --> 14:36.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think she --
first of all,
it's a great victory,
acknowledge it.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has made history.

14:38.411 --> 14:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The single worst campaign slogan
I have ever
heard, "I'm with her," it means
nothing.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It absolutely means nothing to
anybody.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Maybe if you say
like, "I'm with
her."

14:46.753 --> 14:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm with her.

14:47.820 --> 14:48.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

14:48.821 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, like, get
over it.

14:50.723 --> 14:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's about appealing --
and it says
nothing about anybody's life,
about the country.

14:57.630 --> 15:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just thinking tonight of
great speeches
given by presidents on such
occasions, and

15:04.437 --> 15:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the measure of our progress is
not whether
we add more to the abundance of
those who

15:07.540 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have much, whether we provide
enough for those
who have too little, Franklin
Roosevelt.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That really is what Joel
Benenson was kind
of coming down to, that there
had to be some

15:16.649 --> 15:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economic message and some
economic hope for
those who have been left out of
this prosperity

15:23.923 --> 15:25.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the Democrats have
celebrated.

15:25.892 --> 15:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think it's got be --
you have got
to come out of here with a sense
of, this

15:29.762 --> 15:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the difference she's going to
make in her
presidency.

15:33.232 --> 15:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you don't come out of
that with that
tonight, you're never going to
have a chance

15:37.904 --> 15:40.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again in the campaign, but for
the debates.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, you
and Mark
have, I think, basically agreed
for most of

15:43.976 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this campaign that you haven't
heard from
Hillary Clinton the rationale
for her candidacy.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all these months, do you
agree with
Mark it's still not there?

15:53.085 --> 15:55.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I agree the
"I'm with her."

15:55.054 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about I, though.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The great god of Narcissus...

15:57.790 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:59.091 --> 15:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I actually
thought it was "Stronger
Together."

15:59.792 --> 16:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, now it is.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:02.128 --> 16:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would like to
see an animating
passion.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Kaine actually had a good
line.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What animated you before you got
into politics?

16:08.601 --> 16:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she actually does have a
story there to
tell about children.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so drawing that animating
passion will
do good.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has got to hit the safety
point.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really have neglected, as
Amy keeps saying,
the ISIS point.

16:19.011 --> 16:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there is a drumbeat of
ISIS attacks
for the next few months, she has
to establish

16:23.049 --> 16:24.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
herself on that issue.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then, finally, the
emotionality.

16:26.452 --> 16:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the 65-point policy
points, to the
extent that they exist, but is
she willing

16:30.957 --> 16:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be vulnerable, is she willing
to be funny,
is she willing to be both
authoritative, but

16:36.629 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also real?

16:38.231 --> 16:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so less what she says than
the emotional
tone she sets.

16:42.068 --> 16:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it takes a lot of confidence
to be a vulnerable
speaker on this stage.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sometimes she hasn't always
projected
the confidence it takes to be in
some ways

16:50.710 --> 16:52.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weak.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's what I think people
were looking
for, that moment of human
connection.

16:54.347 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's take
this beyond this
arena tonight, because they
leave echoes of

17:00.019 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1992, on a bus tour, the running
mates, tomorrow,
and try to drive through Ohio
and Pennsylvania,

17:06.125 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just because we're in
Pennsylvania, but
because this is a good place to
drive through.

17:09.795 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of -- what are they
setting themselves
up for now as they go forward?

17:13.599 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, it is
interesting that they
are going to all kinds of places
in these

17:18.170 --> 17:19.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two states.

17:19.972 --> 17:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to Columbus, Ohio,
your sort
of quintessential suburban mom
battleground.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they're also going to
Western Pennsylvania.

17:26.145 --> 17:30.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're not ceding that
territory to Donald
Trump.

17:30.616 --> 17:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, I think that the
arc of this
entire convention has been, not
only are we

17:35.254 --> 17:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to cede a certain
vote.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to diversify it, and
then we're
going to reach out and grab some
of those

17:40.960 --> 17:42.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, this is what didn't
happen at the
Republican Convention.

17:45.264 --> 17:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican Convention was
about, we're
just going to double and triple
down on people

17:49.302 --> 17:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are already part of our
party, and we're
going to just rile them up to
get them to

17:53.072 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turn out.

17:54.807 --> 17:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is about, yes, encouraging
the Obama
coalition, but also there was so
much time

17:59.779 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent yesterday and I think too
to those disaffected,
independent Republicans to come
over.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have got to make the
case that they're
worthy of their vote.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark Shields,
does that
mean they can count on their
base, including

18:13.793 --> 18:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bernie supporters, to be on
board enthusiastically
for Hillary Clinton?

18:17.630 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Well,
enthusiastically -- Richard
Nixon said it best, Judy.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It makes no difference whether
they hold your
nose or whether they go would
through a wall

18:24.670 --> 18:25.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to vote for you.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It counts the same with the X.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think some of the
Bernie Sanders
are not enthusiastic.

18:30.876 --> 18:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they are -- they will
vote for Hillary
Clinton.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a few die-hards, no
question about
it.

18:37.149 --> 18:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think it's that base
she's got
to worry about.

18:41.554 --> 18:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea of going to Franklin
County, Ohio,
which is Columbus, that is
surrounded by satellite

18:48.594 --> 18:53.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counties, all of which have been
very Republican,
very upscale, where John Kasich
ran well and

18:53.833 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump ran third in the
primary, as
opposed to Northeastern Ohio,
the real blue-collar,

19:01.774 --> 19:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Youngstown, Mahoning County,
where Donald
Trump rolled up the score and
crushed John

19:08.748 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kasich, and where Democrats are
nervous.

19:11.183 --> 19:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you are fighting for
Ohio, it's really
a message, in Western
Pennsylvania as well,

19:16.756 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you have got a problem with
blue-collar
workers.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about it.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's made inroads.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's an appeal.

19:24.063 --> 19:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's seen as the guy who's going
to take on
the people who got you.

19:28.501 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether that's fair or -- we can
argue about
it, but that is -- he's the
first candidate

19:33.539 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has done that really in
memory, since
the collapse of the steel
industry in this

19:38.611 --> 19:40.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

19:40.446 --> 19:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that's her job, is
that she's got
to try and get those disaffected
Republicans,

19:44.350 --> 19:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the Republicans who are not
-- don't feel
comfortable with Donald Trump.

19:49.155 --> 19:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As we sit here,
there's a sing-along
happening on the convention
floor, which has

19:53.492 --> 19:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already been gaveled into order.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Carole King singing,
"You've Got
a Friend."

19:57.763 --> 20:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it seems to me like they
have a couple
of things they need to do, David
Brooks, which

20:00.066 --> 20:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, we heard -- we keep hearing
it from Clinton
people.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Make her better known.

20:05.571 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that even possible at this
point?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: In theory.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it hasn't happened.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not like she just burst on
the scene,
like she's a fresh new face.

20:14.847 --> 20:15.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: She's like Carole
King.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carole King has been around for
a little while.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so -- but...

20:20.119 --> 20:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But still makes you
warm and fuzzy
whenever you hear her.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That's true, just
like Hillary
Clinton, oddly.

20:24.957 --> 20:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she -- I would love to see
something daring,
some side of Clinton that we
haven't seen

20:30.429 --> 20:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the people talk about in
private, some
risk taken.

20:32.932 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the big undercurrent of
this campaign
is, this is not a normal year.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By normal year standards, Donald
Trump should
be in freefall, and he's not.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's hanging right in there.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So this is a year to do
something unusual,
and I would love the see her
surprise us with

20:46.846 --> 20:48.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something tonight.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
Amy Walter, we will be spending
a lot of time

20:52.351 --> 20:54.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with all of you tonight.

20:54.620 --> 20:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tune in, when we do that,
for our joint
"PBS NewsHour"/NPR coverage of
the Democratic

20:59.058 --> 21:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Convention starting
right here at
8:00 Eastern.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now back to Hari Sreenivasan in
Washington.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Baton
Rouge, Louisiana,
held a vigil to honor three
police officers

21:10.503 --> 21:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who were killed earlier this
month.

21:12.371 --> 21:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were ambushed by a gunman,
who was later
killed by a SWAT team member.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, hundreds of people paid
tribute to
the officers, including Vice
President Joe

21:19.478 --> 21:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Biden and U.S. Attorney General
Loretta Lynch.

21:22.214 --> 21:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: In the
face of division, people who
sought to come

21:26.385 --> 21:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a beautiful town and tear
it apart, in
the face of that desire to sow
hatred, we

21:33.659 --> 21:35.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come together in love.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Baton Rouge has chosen that.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The state has seen it.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The country has seen it.

21:40.432 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are the example for cities
who are facing
these problems.

21:45.037 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The attack on
the officers
came during tensions over the
death of a black

21:49.108 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
man in a struggle with white
police.

21:51.877 --> 21:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, the government and its
Russian allies
offered to open humanitarian
corridors out

21:57.349 --> 21:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the embattled city of Aleppo.

21:59.418 --> 22:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 300,000 people are trapped
in the eastern
part of the city that is held by
rebels.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government troops have encircled
the area,
after intense fighting, and the
army dropped

22:07.960 --> 22:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaflets about the -- quote --
"safe exit
plan."

22:10.963 --> 22:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A special U.N. envoy says
conditions there
are desperate.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: There is
probably, we heard,

22:16.769 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two to three weeks of supply,
and in view
of the bombing of the
warehouses, medical

22:23.876 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facilities, bakeries, the
humanitarian situation
is getting more and more
concerning.

22:29.782 --> 22:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also today,
Syria's President,
Bashar al-Assad, offered general
amnesty for

22:34.720 --> 22:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebels who give up their weapons
and surrender
over the next three months.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, Wall
Street turned in
another so-so day.

22:41.894 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 15 points
to close at 18456.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 15 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added three.

22:50.002 --> 22:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a light show over parts of
the Western
U.S. last night turned out to be
a Chinese

22:54.406 --> 22:56.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rocket burning up in the
atmosphere.

22:56.875 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Social media users captured an
object flaring
up, and leaving streaks of
flames behind it.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sightings were reported from
California to
Utah.

23:05.784 --> 23:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear if the rocket posed
any danger
to those on the ground.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration today
asked blood centers in two in
Florida counties

23:23.335 --> 23:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suspend blood donations until
each unit
can be screened for the Zika
virus.

23:28.941 --> 23:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes as state health
officials investigate
four non-travel-related cases of
Zika, which

23:34.280 --> 23:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may mean the first cases of
local Zika virus
transmission by mosquitoes in
the United States.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For an update on all this, I
spoke earlier
this evening with Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director

23:44.957 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director
of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious

23:52.898 --> 23:55.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Diseases at the NIH.

23:55.567 --> 23:56.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

23:58.370 --> 23:58.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY FAUCI, Director,
National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases: Good to

23:58.771 --> 24:00.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be with you.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
first of all,
this change in status almost,
what does this

24:04.109 --> 24:05.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
warning in Florida mean?

24:05.244 --> 24:07.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:07.046 --> 24:12.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, the warning
from the
FDA is saying that in the
regions in Miami-Dade

24:12.851 --> 24:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Broward County where you
have what looks
like local transmission of
cases, namely,

24:19.091 --> 24:24.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cases that are not
travel-related, don't appear
to be sexually transmitted, and
very likely

24:24.229 --> 24:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquito-transmitted locally,
mainly because
those people never left the
continental United

24:29.902 --> 24:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, so they didn't get
infected elsewhere,
given that, what the FDA is
doing is, they're

24:36.041 --> 24:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying there may be more cases
out there.

24:38.010 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in order to protect the
blood supply and
to be very safe and to keep it
safe, they

24:43.615 --> 24:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are suspending the collection of
blood from
those two areas until they can
implement either

24:51.757 --> 24:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing of the units as they are
donated or
decontaminating of any potential
units that

24:57.796 --> 24:59.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
might be potentially
contaminated.

25:00.032 --> 25:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they want to be quite safe
about it and
very prudent, so that we don't
get contamination

25:06.572 --> 25:08.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the blood supply.

25:08.207 --> 25:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what their particular
order is regarding
collection of bloods.

25:12.044 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, halting
the collection
of blood, that is a pretty
extreme step.

25:16.048 --> 25:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has got to affect local
hospitals that
use it, other places that use
blood.

25:20.319 --> 25:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there some evidence that you
would base
a significant move like this on,
an idea that

25:24.656 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are local mosquitoes there
that would
be carrying Zika?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:28.994 --> 25:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, there's no
doubt that
the mosquitoes that are capable
of transmitting

25:32.264 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Zika are in that area.

25:34.533 --> 25:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the Aedes aegypti
mosquito that's
extensively seen along the Gulf
Coast, the

25:39.671 --> 25:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulf Coast states, and up across
in part of
the East Coast and a little bit
out towards

25:44.443 --> 25:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the West, but certainly along
the Gulf Coastal
states.

25:48.480 --> 25:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that we have now more
than 1,600 travel-related
cases, which is the reason why
one would have

25:56.522 --> 26:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
predicted that, sooner or later,
you're going
to see some local transmission.

26:02.861 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the local transmission that
we're seeing
now is the kind of thing that
makes one want

26:07.266 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure we do what we can
to prevent
that local transmission from
becoming sustained

26:13.839 --> 26:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and from becoming disseminated.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the answer to that is by
very aggressive
mosquito control.

26:19.678 --> 26:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If the FDA
thinks that this
is a good step in the Miami
area, or Dade

26:24.917 --> 26:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County, Broward county area, why
not the entire
southern half of the United
States and where

26:29.354 --> 26:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these mosquitoes could be
traveling?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, you don't
want to do
what is called overreact.

26:35.127 --> 26:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at this point, with the very
local in
two areas cases now, now four
cases that are

26:41.900 --> 26:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under investigation, I think
that that is
prudent enough to do what they
did, because

26:47.906 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience with other viruses,
such as chikungunya
and dengue, is that when you do
get local

26:55.013 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spread like this, it tends to
stay well-contained,
particularly if you do adequate
and aggressive

27:04.289 --> 27:05.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mosquito control.

27:05.991 --> 27:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is not a prediction
that it is going
to be widespread throughout the
area.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what they're doing is,
they're taking the
prudent step of saying, for the
time being,

27:14.867 --> 27:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until we learn otherwise, we're
going to hold
off on the collection of blood
that would

27:19.771 --> 27:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supply this particular two areas
in Florida.

27:23.108 --> 27:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, should
there be a screen
on blood donations throughout
larger regions?

27:30.382 --> 27:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because the FDA came up for a
test for that
a couple of months ago, right?

27:32.784 --> 27:33.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:33.785 --> 27:34.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY FAUCI: Right.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They came up with a test.

27:36.455 --> 27:40.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what's being done is
essentially what's
being done right now in Puerto
Rico.

27:40.592 --> 27:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Puerto Rico has a very
extensive outbreak
that's getting worse and worse
as the weeks

27:46.031 --> 27:47.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go by.

27:47.799 --> 27:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is so much transmission in
Puerto Rico
that, right now, they're
actually doing the

27:53.205 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screening of the blood supply
that we're talking
about.

27:56.742 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you have just a couple
of cases here
and there without the evidence
of any massive

28:02.314 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spread, the prudent decision was
to just let's
just hold off on collection of
blood, and

28:10.289 --> 28:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it gets any worse or it gets
to the point
where it's more disseminated,
then we will

28:14.993 --> 28:16.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do other things.

28:16.795 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, they're going to
ultimately
-- they're going to ultimately
test the blood

28:21.533 --> 28:23.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supply there.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Anthony Fauci
joining us from the National
Institutes of

28:25.604 --> 28:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Health tonight, thanks so much.

28:30.676 --> 28:31.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:31.843 --> 28:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTHONY FAUCI: Thank you.

28:36.515 --> 28:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now an update
to a story
we first reported last year
about an economic

28:41.987 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
development project that
promised to bring
jobs to rural Vermont and green
cards to foreign

28:47.759 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investors.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it's at the center of
federal fraud allegations.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story.

28:53.599 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our series Making
Sense, which
airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

28:57.803 --> 29:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Just four miles
from the Canadian
border, surf's up, however
improbably, or

29:04.710 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was up at the Jay Peak Resort,
when we visited
last fall.

29:09.214 --> 29:14.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The resort is part of a
half-billion dollar
development project designed to
transform

29:14.586 --> 29:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economically depressed
Northeast Kingdom,
as this corner of Vermont is
called, with

29:19.925 --> 29:21.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreign investment.

The developer, Bill Stenger.

29:22.961 --> 29:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL STENGER, CEO, Jay Peak
Resort: In the
last seven years, we have
constructed three

29:26.431 --> 29:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different hotels, a beautiful
indoor water
park, ice arena, conference
center, wedding

29:32.104 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
facility.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have had a tremendous
impact on our
local economy regionally as
well.

29:36.675 --> 29:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A local economy
that, for most
of Vermont's history, has been
at the very

29:41.013 --> 29:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottom, but was suddenly leading
the state
in job creation.

29:44.816 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the story seemed to be
win-win-win, Northeast
Kingdom wins, tourists win, and
so do the

29:50.989 --> 29:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign investors, not only with
a promised
return on their investment, but
-- and here's

29:56.161 --> 30:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the novel incentive of the
so-called EB-5
visa program -- with green
cards, permanent

30:03.301 --> 30:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resident visas for the investors
and their
families, in exchange for
forking over $500,000

30:10.042 --> 30:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to private companies to create
at least 10
jobs in areas of deep
unemployment.

30:15.414 --> 30:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think it is fair that
rich people get
to come to the United States,
when there are

30:20.118 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many truly desperate emigres
from a place
like Syria, say, out there on
the water as

30:26.391 --> 30:28.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we speak?

30:28.226 --> 30:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL STENGER: I'm seeking
capital from a legal
source that's been in existence
since 1990

30:34.499 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that is promoted by our
government, helps
us.

30:37.669 --> 30:42.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, they
certainly seem to
be improving life in and around
Jay Peak.

30:42.441 --> 30:49.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Before the EB-5-funded
renovation and expansion
began in 2008, this was a ski
slope going

30:49.715 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
downhill.

30:51.616 --> 30:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we visited last year, it
was a year-round
resort attracting a million
customers annually

30:57.222 --> 31:00.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to its rides, rinks,
restaurants.

31:00.792 --> 31:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dining revenues alone topped $10
million a
year, double what the entire
resort took ink

31:07.065 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pre-EB-5.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: To do something like this
for this area
is immense.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's priceless.

31:13.538 --> 31:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For chef Mike
Eldred and his
assistant, Bob McCrary, economic
growth has

31:17.609 --> 31:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meant career growth as well.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It gives me an opportunity
where I can
become a supervisor.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can keep moving up.

31:24.182 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Growth that even
benefited the
local quilting bee, whose
membership has quadrupled

31:28.653 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their new digs.

31:29.788 --> 31:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Helen Short is a nurse from
nearby Enosburg
Falls.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HELEN SHORT, Nurse: I
voluntarily went up
and spoke to Bill Stenger
because I wanted

31:36.361 --> 31:37.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to thank him.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of the farms were going
out of business.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There wasn't much opportunity
for the youth
in this area.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now you have come here, and
it's like
this big enterprise and there is
building

31:45.737 --> 31:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and construction going on, and
students are
employed in high school.

31:49.608 --> 31:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As lifeguards, ski
patrols, desk
clerks.

31:53.745 --> 31:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No wonder that in neighboring
Newport, Bill
Stenger was celebrated as man of
the year,

31:58.784 --> 32:00.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if not the millennium.

32:00.919 --> 32:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newport was where Stenger and
his partner,
Ariel Quiros, had half-a-dozen
new EB-5 projects

32:08.593 --> 32:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pending, most ambitiously, some
said delusionally,
a stem cell manufacturing
facility affiliated

32:15.700 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a South Korean biotech
firm.

32:17.602 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIEL QUIROS, Chairman: We also
will co-develop
and manufacture various kinds of
artificial

32:23.275 --> 32:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organs, such as artificial
kidney, heart and
liver.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Skeptical yet?

32:30.081 --> 32:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in December, investors like
Tony Sutton
in England were complaining they
had been

32:35.587 --> 32:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scammed, and gotten no return at
all on their
investment.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON, Investor: They gave
us all IOUs.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the company
that the IOUs
are drawn against, our research
suggests that

32:46.264 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that company has no assets, no
income and
no way of servicing the IOUs for
any of the

32:51.736 --> 32:53.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investors.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you don't think
you will
ever get your capital back?

32:55.340 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON: No, not from Jay
Peak.

32:57.542 --> 33:03.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile,
developer Stenger
was all innocence, claiming to
be stung by

33:03.248 --> 33:05.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any suspicions.

33:05.116 --> 33:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL STENGER: Hundreds of
families are relying
on me and my team to implement
what we do,

33:10.021 --> 33:11.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and do it right.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Look, relying on
him, they were.

33:13.658 --> 33:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reason for this update
is that, in
April, the Securities and
Exchange Commission

33:18.430 --> 33:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charged Bill Stenger and Ariel
Quiros with
52 counts of federal securities
violations,

33:26.571 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alleging they'd misused more
than $200 million
in investor funds, of $350
million total,

33:34.279 --> 33:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that Quiros had personally
stolen over
$55 million to buy, among other
things, a

33:40.252 --> 33:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$4 million condo on New York's
Fifth Avenue,
and a $2.5 million crib on the
Hudson River.

33:47.092 --> 33:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state and FBI are also
investigating for
criminal violations.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it turned out to be even
worse than you
thought?

33:54.566 --> 33:56.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANNE GALLOWAY, Vermont
Journalism Trust: It
did, indeed.

33:57.002 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Investigative
reporter Anne Galloway
has been covering Jay Peak, and
uncovering

34:01.873 --> 34:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questionable practices there,
for years.

34:05.010 --> 34:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even she is shocked by the
extent of the
alleged fraud.

34:08.346 --> 34:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: It took me a
while to wrap
my head around it, the scale of
it.

34:11.583 --> 34:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It was a Byzantine
scheme, says
the SEC.

34:15.353 --> 34:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of using EB-5 funds as
required by
law, Stenger and Quiros wove a
tangled web

34:22.694 --> 34:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of diversion and deception.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: They used margin
loans.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They used Treasury bills.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They used 100 different bank
accounts and
many different banks.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Quiros is fighting
the charges.

34:33.772 --> 34:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stenger, who declined our
request for an interview,
is trying to settle with the SEC
and keep

34:40.278 --> 34:42.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the boat afloat.

34:42.147 --> 34:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: He goes in every
day, under
the supervision of the receiver,
Michael Goldberg,

34:46.818 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to keep the resort operating
smoothly.

34:48.586 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Galloway quotes
Goldberg saying
that, unlike Quiros, Stenger did
not siphon

34:53.959 --> 34:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
personal funds from the fraud.

34:55.894 --> 35:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the receiver is working on
behalf of the
people who've lost their money
to try to recover

35:01.066 --> 35:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as much of it as possible?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: That's right.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But keeping it open is a
challenge.

35:05.603 --> 35:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have 700 investors who
have been
hurt by this, and that's a very
tough problem

35:12.711 --> 35:14.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to solve.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Some investors,
like Tony Sutton,
who put his money in the fully
built Tram

35:18.350 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haus Lodge, at least got their
green cards.

35:21.553 --> 35:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more than half did not, and
probably never
will, because their unfinished
projects will

35:28.059 --> 35:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not have created the necessary
10 jobs per
investor.

35:31.663 --> 35:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of the 400 or so investors
who may never
get permanent green cards, how
many will get

35:38.837 --> 35:40.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their money back?

35:40.705 --> 35:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: At this point,
it's not clear
that any of them are going to
get all of their

35:44.876 --> 35:46.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
money back.

35:46.745 --> 35:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, thus, the
largest EB-5 project
in Vermont may become the
largest fraud in

35:51.950 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vermont's and EB-5's history,
and a key prompt
to reform America's
cash-for-visas program.

36:01.126 --> 36:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is economics correspondent
Paul Solman,
reporting from Northeast
Kingdom, Vermont.

36:10.602 --> 36:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We like to
think that when
we step into the voting booth,
we make rational

36:20.045 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decisions when casting our
votes.

36:22.280 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We pick one candidate over
another because
of their policies, or their
positions on the

36:27.052 --> 36:28.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

36:28.887 --> 36:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a growing body of
evidence indicating
that other factors might also be
at play.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has more on
that.

36:34.893 --> 36:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hillary
Clinton secured
the Democratic nomination in
large part by

36:38.963 --> 36:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racking up big numbers with
women voters,
black voters and Latino voters.

36:43.435 --> 36:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she did worst among one
particular demographic:
white males.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why is that?

36:48.406 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it her policies?

36:49.441 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or is it that she's a woman?

36:51.443 --> 36:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Daniel Bush has
just written
a fascinating piece exploring
what might be

36:55.747 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on in voters' minds and
what this means
for the coming election, now
that we have

37:00.185 --> 37:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first woman ever at the top
of a major
political party.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Daniel joins me now.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder, what was it you were
really trying
to get at with this piece?

37:07.926 --> 37:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: There was an
interesting gender
gap that played out in the
primaries.

37:11.429 --> 37:17.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw that, in more diverse
states, especially
in the South, Clinton did very
well with men,

37:17.368 --> 37:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
African-Americans, Latinos.

37:19.104 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once we got up into the
Midwest, the Rust
Belt, a different story played
out.

37:23.608 --> 37:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders carried the male
vote by 29
points in Wisconsin, by 19
points in West

37:28.713 --> 37:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, and the list goes on
and on and
on.

37:30.548 --> 37:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's obviously a lot of
factors why
white men might not want to vote
for Hillary

37:35.353 --> 37:39.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton in the general election,
also in the
primaries, but gender is
obviously sort of

37:39.624 --> 37:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an underlying current in this
election.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your piece,
you introduced
me to a term I had never heard
about before.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called ambivalent sexism.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is that?

37:49.534 --> 37:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: So, researchers who
study these
issues, who study bias and
stereotyping, for

37:53.905 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a long time thought that
stereotyping was
basically uniformly negative.

37:57.809 --> 38:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what researchers who focus
on gender specifically
in the 1990s and on have
realized is that

38:04.816 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gender bias takes different
forms.

38:06.784 --> 38:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's what they call
hostile sexism,
sort of overtly negative views
of women, what

38:12.323 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we typically associate with
gender discrimination,
right?

38:14.792 --> 38:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's also ambivalent or
benevolent
sexism, which, from a male point
of view,

38:20.165 --> 38:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encourages men to be supportive
of women who
are in traditional roles,
traditional gender

38:24.435 --> 38:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roles, but when women step out
of that, when
they seek power, when they seek
to enter male-dominated

38:29.474 --> 38:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fields, men tend to look at them
worse.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And obviously we're seeing that
play out with
Hillary Clinton.

38:33.945 --> 38:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In piece, you
talked with
a lot of white male voters in
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

38:37.615 --> 38:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, when someone is
asked, they're
going to say, I'm not a sexist,
I don't have

38:41.786 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those feelings.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how did you see this play
out in the men
that you talked to?

38:45.623 --> 38:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: So, I talked to a
lot of voters
who said, yes, I feel
comfortable voting for

38:50.028 --> 38:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a woman, but just not Hillary
Clinton.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's not the right one.

38:54.232 --> 38:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they went on to list a
number of
reasons: She's too shrill, she's
too loud,

38:58.303 --> 38:59.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she's not trustworthy.

39:00.004 --> 39:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while they may feel that
about Clinton,
sort of generally speaking, on a
personal

39:03.575 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level, without realizing that it
has to do
with gender, all of the
signifiers that they

39:08.112 --> 39:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used to describe a woman in
power or running
for a top position in government
sort of come

39:14.419 --> 39:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into play and are connected to
the way that
researchers look at gender bias
and discrimination.

39:20.058 --> 39:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How do we know
with some
of the other men that you talked
to, or just

39:23.828 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men more broadly, that their
beef with Hillary
Clinton might be about her
policies or her

39:29.100 --> 39:30.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positions?

39:30.635 --> 39:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, how do we know that it's
overtly about
the fact that she's a woman?

39:32.804 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: On an individual,
case-by-case
basis, it's difficult to say,
yes, this voter

39:39.177 --> 39:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in particular doesn't like
Hillary Clinton
only because she is a woman.

39:43.581 --> 39:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, there are
millions of voters
across the country, in the
primaries, and

39:47.452 --> 39:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there will be in the general,
who have legitimate
policy disagreements, right,
with Clinton,

39:51.422 --> 39:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it's about health care,
whether it's
about taxes, and so on.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you really start
talking to men -- and
in this story in particular, we
were looking

39:58.196 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at white men -- you see that
gender is an
underlying sort of current in
the way that

40:02.967 --> 40:04.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they think about Hillary
Clinton.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, going
forward, we have
now an election with Trump
against Hillary.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you foresee this
particular conversation
playing out?

40:10.875 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: The people that I
spoke to for
this piece compared it a little
bit to the

40:15.580 --> 40:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change in dialogue on race
relations after
President Obama was elected.

40:20.084 --> 40:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we might see a similar thing
play out
here where, whether Clinton wins
or loses,

40:25.723 --> 40:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's going to be sort of a
more -- a greater
public consciousness, right,
about gender,

40:30.094 --> 40:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about gender roles, about the
way that men
and women hold power in the
country.

40:34.699 --> 40:35.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it might be ugly.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It might be divisive.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can certainly expect that in
the general
election campaign.

40:39.404 --> 40:42.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hopefully, at least it will
get people
talking about it and thinking
about it as

40:42.774 --> 40:44.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, the
"NewsHour"'s
Daniel Bush, thanks for this.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Great reporting.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: Thanks for having
me.

40:48.413 --> 40:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
the gender gap
and the future of the Democratic
Party, we

40:51.849 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go back to Gwen and Judy in
Philadelphia.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Hari.

40:58.589 --> 41:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we pick up on the challenges
Hillary Clinton
faces, especially with white
male voters in

41:03.127 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this election, with Richard
Trumka.

41:05.363 --> 41:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the president of the
AFL-CIO.

41:07.031 --> 41:11.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the largest organization of
labor unions
in the country.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Senator Cory Booker of New
Jersey.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rich Trumka, let me start with
you.

41:18.076 --> 41:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pick up on what you just heard
from our reporter
Dan Bush.

41:22.213 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you hear, what do you
know about your
rank-and-file union members who
are hearing

41:26.918 --> 41:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump saying, "I will be
your voice,
if you feel forgotten, I will be
your voice,"

41:31.856 --> 41:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then how does that square
with this -- whether
it's latent or another form of
sexism that

41:37.862 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
may be going on?

41:39.530 --> 41:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA, President,
AFL-CIO: Well,
I think he's successfully tapped
into the

41:41.966 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustration and anger across the
white males
and across the working people in
general.

41:47.372 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you give them the facts
about his
policies, that he thinks our
wages are too

41:51.743 --> 41:55.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
high, that he supports
right-to-work, they
come back across the bridge.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, in the last election, we
had the same
problem with Barack Obama.

41:58.683 --> 42:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was because of race, not sex
at that point
or gender.

42:03.354 --> 42:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were able, given our
program, talking
our member-to-member program, it
was a 56-percent

42:08.393 --> 42:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference, 56-point difference
between union
white males and the white males
of the general

42:14.499 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population, because we gave them
the facts,
we talked to them,
member-to-member stuff,

42:19.003 --> 42:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will be able to do the
same thing in
this election.

42:21.439 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Booker,
given what we
know about Donald Trump's
strengths, as well

42:25.543 --> 42:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Hillary Clinton's strengths
and weaknesses,
who are the Clinton voters and
who are not

42:30.381 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Clinton voters?

42:31.382 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who's not worth going after?

42:32.383 --> 42:34.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

42:34.185 --> 42:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER (D), New Jersey:
Well, I think
we have got to play the full
court and try

42:34.886 --> 42:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get every voter that we can.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's naturally a base
for the Democratic
Party.

42:38.256 --> 42:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And any Democrat running is
trying to get
that Obama coalition, which is
an increasingly

42:43.094 --> 42:44.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diverse voter base.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's young folks.

42:45.496 --> 42:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's minorities, as well as
white women.

42:48.199 --> 42:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think we as a party
can afford
to alienate or not try to speak
to the concerns,

42:53.771 --> 42:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fears, insecurities, aspirations
of white
men.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We should not give up that
ground.

42:58.142 --> 42:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How do you do that?

42:59.143 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does she do that?

43:00.144 --> 43:02.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER: Well, I think we do
that by talking
about the issues, by talking
about where people

43:04.081 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, what they're struggling
with, whether
it's the high cost of college
education, whether

43:07.585 --> 43:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the fact that they're
working harder
than their parents, but making
less money.

43:11.823 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's trying to do things like
talk to them
about expanding opportunity
through infrastructure

43:16.661 --> 43:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investment and the kind of
things that grow
solid middle-class jobs.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I'm a competitor.

43:21.532 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't want to say, hey,
just because
this person is a woman or this
person is a

43:24.302 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minority, that they're not going
to get the
white male vote.

43:26.170 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want everybody to think about
what's in
their interests.

43:29.106 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that our party
platform has
a better vision and better
actually pathway

43:34.312 --> 43:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for white Americans, as well
black Americans,
Latino Americans, women, and so
forth, to

43:38.516 --> 43:40.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be successful.

43:40.251 --> 43:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Rich Trumka,
how do you
know that describing what
Hillary Clinton

43:43.521 --> 43:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to do is going to be
enough against
what's almost a siren song
coming from Donald

43:49.126 --> 43:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump that, I will be there for
you, this
is a -- we live in a fearful
time, it's a

43:53.364 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dangerous time, and we all -- we
need somebody
to protect us, and I will be
there and I will

43:59.470 --> 44:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
create jobs and build a wall,
and I will do
all the rest of it?

44:02.206 --> 44:07.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA: Judy, you forget
that we face
a campaign of fear and division
every day

44:07.245 --> 44:11.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the workplace or every time
we try to organize
a work site.

44:11.148 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're able to get through that
by talking
through the facts and having
people join together.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, Donald Trump, I will say
three things
about Donald Trump.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One, he's unfit to be president.

44:21.092 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two, he would make it much more
difficult
for working people to make ends
meet.

44:26.097 --> 44:28.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, three, he would tear our
country apart.

44:28.266 --> 44:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you talk to them about
those three things,
they really do understand.

44:32.236 --> 44:33.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're very thoughtful.

44:33.971 --> 44:35.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Working people really amaze me.

44:35.640 --> 44:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you give them all the
facts, they make
the right decision every single
time.

44:39.777 --> 44:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But given what we
have seen here
on this convention floor, isn't
trade policy,

44:43.514 --> 44:46.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couldn't that be a breaking
point, a weak
point?

44:46.350 --> 44:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA: Well, it's an
exceptional
-- it's exceptionally important.

44:49.086 --> 44:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, we have a raising wages
agenda.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that includes tax policy,
trade policy.

44:53.958 --> 44:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TPP is a very bad agreement.

44:55.893 --> 45:00.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Covers 40 percent of the world's
economy,
and it will cost us jobs.

45:00.298 --> 45:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not well-drafted.

45:02.066 --> 45:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an agreement, an investment
agreement
that will benefit Wall Street a
lot, but not

45:07.505 --> 45:08.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working people.

45:08.639 --> 45:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has the same
exact position.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's against TPP.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She will be against TPP.

45:14.078 --> 45:15.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Now.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all it takes?

45:17.014 --> 45:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA: Well, but, look,
let's talk
about what's a responsible
legislator.

45:21.986 --> 45:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can be dogmatic, like Donald
Trump, and
say don't tell me any of the
facts, I have

45:26.157 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made up my mind, I don't want to
hear anything,
or you can say, look, trade can
be good or

45:30.962 --> 45:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it can be bad, depending on the
rules.

45:34.198 --> 45:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she saw the rules that were
drafted,
she said, this doesn't make it,
just like

45:38.869 --> 45:39.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we did.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so she was against it.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's responsible legislating.

45:43.774 --> 45:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish more legislators would do
exactly that.

45:46.877 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Booker,
pick up on
that, because we have got a
chorus of Bernie

45:51.148 --> 45:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders supporters out there
who, for the
last three nights, have been
holding up signs

45:55.753 --> 46:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or, essentially, their
argument is, Hillary
Clinton was late to this
position, she took

46:00.758 --> 46:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this position for political
reasons.

46:02.326 --> 46:04.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're hearing the same thing
from Donald Trump.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

46:06.030 --> 46:07.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER: Well, speaking as
somebody who
voted against TPA and has a lot
of suspicions

46:07.865 --> 46:12.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about TPP that are reflected in
our concerns
about what's hurting the
American economy

46:12.737 --> 46:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what the opportunity is to
grow, I have
to say I like a person like
Hillary Clinton

46:16.474 --> 46:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is willing to analyze the
facts.

46:18.242 --> 46:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have met no one smarter than
her in politics.

46:20.911 --> 46:24.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, some of my
conversations with her
over the last few weeks made me
go home and

46:24.415 --> 46:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start studying, because I wanted
to be able
to keep up on some policy
issues.

46:27.852 --> 46:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm happy that she came to a
conclusion
after studying this that
resonates with what

46:32.156 --> 46:34.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trumka was saying.

46:34.058 --> 46:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I just believe right now,
more than ever,
if you are a working-class
American -- I don't

46:37.828 --> 46:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care if you're a working-class
white, if you're
a working-class black, what your
ethnic background

46:41.165 --> 46:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- if you look at our two
party platforms,
especially if you're a union
member -- this

46:45.002 --> 46:46.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not just about TPP.

46:46.771 --> 46:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's even just the right to
organize unions
is being assaulted by the
Republican Party

46:50.508 --> 46:51.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a continuous basis.

46:51.842 --> 46:53.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We see it in the Senate.

46:53.678 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the things that have built
this country,
strong middle-class jobs, we're
fighting for

46:58.382 --> 47:00.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those.

47:00.317 --> 47:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I sit in the Senate, and
see what Republicans
are often advocating, it's those
kind of tax

47:03.387 --> 47:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loopholes for the richest of the
rich or,
frankly, for corporations and
giving incentives

47:07.558 --> 47:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them to move jobs and
opportunity overseas.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this has got to be an
election where we
talk to people's interests.

47:12.763 --> 47:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I don't want to see my
party do is
to begin to talk down towards
white men, as

47:17.568 --> 47:21.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if their concerns are not
legitimate and that
we shouldn't be listening to a
lot of their

47:21.038 --> 47:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aspirations and hopes as well.

47:22.573 --> 47:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Booker, you
and I have
talked about this lot.

47:24.775 --> 47:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four years -- eight years ago,
we saw the
breakthrough with President
Obama.

47:29.647 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Americans had to adjust
their thinking
in order to elect the first
black president.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is necessary for Americans
to elect the
first woman president?

47:37.555 --> 47:38.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
More or less difficult?

47:38.556 --> 47:40.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

47:40.357 --> 47:43.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER: Well, I think that
we need to
have an honest conversation in
this country.

47:43.661 --> 47:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this idea that somehow we're
beyond sexism,
beyond racism is just wrong.

47:48.332 --> 47:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is where having an
honest conversation
with white men about their
issues and their

47:52.636 --> 47:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerns, and having honest
conversations
about the experiences that
African-Americans

47:55.973 --> 47:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are still having, despite who's
the president
of the United States, in the
criminal justice

47:59.510 --> 48:04.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
system that we see in
sentencing, we see in
policing and a lot of these
issues.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gender bias is real.

48:06.150 --> 48:09.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was an early Obama supporter,
and I was
even shocked at the way the
media treated

48:09.653 --> 48:12.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama vs. how they
treated Secretary
Clinton.

48:12.690 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Questions that were asked about,
what is wearing,
how much does she weigh, about
her hair were

48:17.194 --> 48:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never ascribed to the president.

48:18.796 --> 48:20.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We live in a gender-biased
world.

48:20.564 --> 48:25.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see -- saw it growing up with
a mom who
was one of first people -- women
to make high

48:25.436 --> 48:30.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ranks in IBM, and the stories
that I heard
around my kitchen table about
what she experienced.

48:30.975 --> 48:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I know we have a lot.

48:32.777 --> 48:37.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do know that this history
we're making
tonight, when Hillary Clinton
will accept

48:37.515 --> 48:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nomination, I think it's
going to go good
steps in helping this country
heal from its

48:42.153 --> 48:46.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past and grow towards its future
that's more
inclusive, more accepting and
more realizing

48:46.957 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that every American has value
and that discrimination
has no place in politics, in the
workplace

48:51.829 --> 48:53.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anywhere at all.

48:53.664 --> 48:57.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rich Trumka,
let's just come
back to that first question we
talked about,

48:57.735 --> 49:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based on our earlier reporting.

49:00.871 --> 49:06.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Are you having, are your
associates having
honest conversations, as Senator
Booker just

49:06.510 --> 49:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, about what is sexism that
still exists
among men?

49:10.247 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA: We started --
after Ferguson,
I appointed a race commission in
the AFL-CIO.

49:17.121 --> 49:23.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we went around the country
talking first
to our members, outside the
spotlight, not

49:23.093 --> 49:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public conversations, but
private conversations.

49:25.696 --> 49:28.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was amazing to see the
difference.

49:28.833 --> 49:33.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It takes about an
hour-and-a-half for people
in a room to start trusting each
other enough

49:34.004 --> 49:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be able to start telling
what's really
in their heart and then sharing
it with one

49:38.209 --> 49:39.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
another.

49:39.210 --> 49:40.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't feel they are going
to be attacked.

49:40.711 --> 49:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The same is true about sex
gender.

49:46.217 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, we had this conversation
when Hillary
ran against President Obama.

49:52.790 --> 49:54.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had that conversation.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had a twofer at that time,
because I would
say to our members, if you're
not voting for

49:57.761 --> 50:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barack Obama because he's black,
you're wrong.

50:01.031 --> 50:05.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're not voting for Hillary
Clinton because
she's a woman, you're equally
wrong.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we started that
conversation.

50:07.771 --> 50:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We still have a long way to go.

50:09.640 --> 50:14.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, quite frankly, we're
further along
with that conversation with the
American worker

50:14.178 --> 50:15.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than we are with race.

50:16.013 --> 50:20.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think race is sort of more
hidden and more
difficult to pull out and get
people to start

50:20.451 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
confronting and talking about.

50:21.452 --> 50:23.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

50:23.287 --> 50:25.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER: But I see great
signs, when you
have the head of the FBI,
Republican, Comey,

50:25.456 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about implicit racial
bias, how we
can deal with it.

50:28.425 --> 50:32.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our country really is coming to
a point where
we're having more constructive
conversations.

50:32.463 --> 50:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I have tremendous hope.

50:33.464 --> 50:34.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD TRUMKA: Yes.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I think so too.

50:36.333 --> 50:36.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And it's a
conversation we're
going to have to continue
another time, because

50:36.867 --> 50:38.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we can't right now.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cory Booker, Rich Trumka, thank
you both very
much.

50:39.570 --> 50:40.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

50:40.571 --> 50:41.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

50:41.572 --> 50:42.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CORY BOOKER: Thank you.

50:42.573 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD TRUMKA: Thanks for
having us on.

50:44.108 --> 50:46.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And finally tonight,
a different
view of the convention floor.

50:46.110 --> 50:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Curators from the Smithsonian
Museum of American
History are on hand tonight, and
were in Cleveland

50:49.947 --> 50:52.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last week for the Republican
Convention.

50:52.216 --> 50:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a decades-long tradition,
and a mission
to preserve political history.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We caught up with a couple of
the curators
recently.

50:58.489 --> 51:01.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA KATHLEEN GRADDY, Curator,
Smithsonian
National Museum of American
History: We are

51:01.592 --> 51:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world's biggest trollers for
objects.

51:04.361 --> 51:07.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We walk up to people and say,
hi, I really
like that hat you're wearing.

51:07.932 --> 51:11.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't suppose you would like it
to be part
of the national collection?

51:11.936 --> 51:13.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Lisa Kathleen Graddy.

51:13.570 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm a curator at the
Smithsonian's National
Museum of American History.

51:17.107 --> 51:23.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Smithsonian has been
collecting the convention
since 1960, so we're here to
interact with

51:23.981 --> 51:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the delegates and to pick up
material from
them that show their particular
support of

51:28.953 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their candidate.

51:30.754 --> 51:31.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JON GRINSPAN, Curator,
Smithsonian National
Museum of American History:
People usually

51:31.322 --> 51:32.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
love the Smithsonian.

51:32.189 --> 51:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's a great conversations
starter.

51:34.024 --> 51:35.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Jon Grinspan.

51:35.826 --> 51:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a curator at the National
Museum of American
History.

51:39.563 --> 51:41.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a lot of being nice to
people.

51:41.398 --> 51:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a lot of handing out cards,
complimenting
people's objects that they have
brought, and

51:44.568 --> 51:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to at the end of the week
get them
to give it to us or donate it to
us.

51:48.372 --> 51:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA KATHLEEN GRADDY: One of the
most significant
things about this election is,
it's the first

51:52.009 --> 51:55.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time that a woman will be
running as a major
party's candidate.

51:55.245 --> 52:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be looking for things
that show women's
support of Hillary Clinton as a
woman candidate.

52:00.684 --> 52:06.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was up in a higher level and
saw a woman
on the floor wearing Minnie
Mouse ears with

52:06.523 --> 52:08.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Hillary Clinton button in the
middle of
the bow.

52:08.659 --> 52:12.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I successfully located her in
the Florida
delegation, and she's going to
send me her

52:12.496 --> 52:14.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Minnie Mouse ears.

52:14.264 --> 52:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON GRINSPAN: And other things,
we look for
objects that say 2016, that say
something

52:17.634 --> 52:22.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Hillary, or about Trump,
or immigration,
or issues of the day, so that,
in the future,

52:22.306 --> 52:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can use these objects as a
document to
try to understand the past.

52:25.075 --> 52:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA KATHLEEN GRADDY: Something
that's yours
and you kind of treat with a
little bit of

52:28.345 --> 52:33.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cavalier fashion, once we get
it to a museum,
it becomes a museum object.

52:33.317 --> 52:37.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wear white gloves and we
give it a
specific number, so we can track
it for the

52:37.488 --> 52:39.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rest of its life in the
collection.

52:39.289 --> 52:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON GRINSPAN: We have these
collections that
go back for campaigning
throughout American

52:41.658 --> 52:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history, from William Henry
Harrison in 1840
to Lincoln in 1860.

52:45.462 --> 52:51.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA KATHLEEN GRADDY: We have
Ike Girl dresses,
and we have hats, and we have
buttons, things

52:51.335 --> 52:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that now we look at and think,
well, isn't
that sort of funny, these
buttons, these hats,

52:55.639 --> 52:58.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in a hundred years' time
will also be
national treasures.

52:58.776 --> 53:01.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I may have some of
those buttons.

53:01.945 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Me, too.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well, from
Philadelphia, that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:05.449 --> 53:07.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But stay with us.

53:07.384 --> 53:10.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be back right here at
8:00 p.m. Eastern
with full coverage of the®MD-BO /
Democratic

53:10.888 --> 53:11.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Convention.

53:11.889 --> 53:12.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:14.792 --> 53:17.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online throughout this
night and again
right here tomorrow evening,
with Mark Shields

53:17.761 --> 53:19.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and David Brooks.

53:19.630 --> 53:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
