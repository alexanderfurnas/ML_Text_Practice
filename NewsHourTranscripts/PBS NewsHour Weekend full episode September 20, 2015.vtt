00:05.867 --> 00:07.633
FOR SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20:

00:07.633 --> 00:08.900
THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCES IT

00:08.900 --> 00:10.100
WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:10.100 --> 00:12.467
REFUGEES IT TAKES IN.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.167
AND, HOW SYRIAN REFUGEE FAMILIES

00:14.167 --> 00:16.433
ARE STARTING OVER, IN GERMANY.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.433
>> IT'S NOT EASY TO LEAVE

00:17.433 --> 00:19.667
EVERYTHING BACK THERE.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.100
BUT WHEN YOU SETTLE DOWN IN

00:21.100 --> 00:25.433
ANOTHER COUNTRY, YOU FIND A JOB,

00:25.433 --> 00:26.200
YOU LEARN A LANGUAGE, YOU

00:26.200 --> 00:27.167
ESTABLISH A FAMILY, AND IT

00:27.167 --> 00:28.133
BECOMES YOUR HOME.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.667
>> Sreenivasan: ALSO, TIME FOR

00:29.667 --> 00:30.533
SCHOOL.

00:30.533 --> 00:31.667
IN BRAZIL LIVING IN POVERTY AND

00:31.667 --> 00:34.100
FIGHTING FOR AN EDUCATION.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.133
>> (translated): MY FUTURE IS

00:35.133 --> 00:35.667
NOT GUARANTEED.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.333
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE

00:37.333 --> 00:39.167
MY FUTURE IS BY GOING TO SCHOOL.

00:39.167 --> 00:40.333
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:40.333 --> 00:43.200
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.400

00:44.400 --> 00:47.533

00:47.533 --> 00:50.200
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.333
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:51.333 --> 00:52.800
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.900
THE UNITED STATES PLANS TO OPEN

00:53.900 --> 00:55.500
ITS DOORS A BIT WIDER TO

00:55.500 --> 00:56.467
REFUGEES, INCLUDING SOME WHO ARE

00:56.467 --> 00:58.433
FLOODING INTO EUROPE.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.833
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

00:59.833 --> 01:01.167
PUSHING TO RAISE THE CAP ON

01:01.167 --> 01:02.800
REFUGEES ADMITTED TO THE U.S.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.400
FROM AROUND THE WORLD FROM

01:05.400 --> 01:07.300
70,000 A YEAR TO 85,000 NEXT

01:07.300 --> 01:08.400
YEAR, AND TO 100,000 IN TWO

01:08.400 --> 01:10.333
YEARS.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.267
THE GOAL OF ADMITTING 15,000

01:12.267 --> 01:13.967
MORE REFUGEES NEXT YEAR IS

01:13.967 --> 01:15.533
HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED

01:15.533 --> 01:17.133
BY THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.333
CONGRESS NEEDS TO APPROVE AND

01:18.333 --> 01:20.100
FUND THE RESETTLEMENT PLAN.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.500
BACKGROUND CHECKS ALONE CAN TAKE

01:21.500 --> 01:23.667
18-TO-24 MONTHS.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.100
THE U.S. HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO

01:25.100 --> 01:26.700
1,600 SYRIAN REFUGEES SINCE THAT

01:26.700 --> 01:28.300
COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR BEGAN IN

01:28.300 --> 01:30.233
2011, BUT NOT ALL OF THE

01:30.233 --> 01:31.133
ADDITIONAL REFUGEES TO THE U.S.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.800
WILL BE SYRIAN.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.900
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

01:34.900 --> 01:37.233
MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY

01:37.233 --> 01:38.900
AFTER CONFERRING WITH OFFICIALS

01:38.900 --> 01:40.533
IN GERMANY, THE NATION THAT HAS

01:40.533 --> 01:41.600
WELCOMED THE MOST MIGRANTS NOW

01:41.600 --> 01:46.533
SEEKING ASYLUM IN EUROPE.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.333
>> THIS STEP IS IN KEEPING WITH

01:48.333 --> 01:50.967
THE AMERICA'S BEST TRADITION AS

01:50.967 --> 01:52.167
A LAND OF SECOND CHANCES AND A

01:52.167 --> 01:55.267
BEACON OF HOPE.

01:55.267 --> 01:56.733
>> Sreenivasan: THE U.S.

01:56.733 --> 01:58.100
ANNOUNCEMENT COMES AS MANY

01:58.100 --> 01:59.467
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE ERECTING

01:59.467 --> 02:00.867
BARRIERS AND ISSUING TOUGHER

02:00.867 --> 02:02.333
IDENTITY CHECKS AT THEIR

02:02.333 --> 02:03.933
BORDERS, ALTHOUGH AUSTRIA

02:03.933 --> 02:04.767
ACCEPTED 15,000 NEW ARRIVALS

02:04.767 --> 02:06.800
THIS WEEKEND.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
THE UNITED NATIONS SAID THIS

02:08.400 --> 02:10.200
WEEKEND 80% OF THE MIGRANTS ARE

02:10.200 --> 02:11.400
FROM WAR-TORN SYRIA, LIBYA,

02:11.400 --> 02:13.233
IRAQ, AND AFGHANISTAN.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.633
THE NEWSHOUR'S SASKIA DEMELKER

02:14.633 --> 02:15.600
HAS THIS REPORT ABOUT ONE SYRIAN

02:15.600 --> 02:18.733
FAMILY'S ODYSSEY.

02:18.733 --> 02:20.533
>> Reporter: WHEN I FIRST MET

02:20.533 --> 02:22.000
HAMEED AND GHOSON YAKDI, THEIR

02:22.000 --> 02:23.233
FAMILY WAS SLEEPING ON THE

02:23.233 --> 02:24.500
STREET NEAR THE HUNGARIAN BORDER

02:24.500 --> 02:25.633
WITH AUSTRIA, ALREADY A MONTH

02:25.633 --> 02:26.300
INTO THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS

02:26.300 --> 02:28.167
EUROPE.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.633
THEY LEFT THEIR BESIEGED

02:29.633 --> 02:31.333
HOMETOWN OF ALEPPO, SYRIA, FOR

02:31.333 --> 02:33.033
TURKEY, AFTER DAYS AT SEA TO GET

02:33.033 --> 02:34.533
TO GREECE, THEY TRAVELED

02:34.533 --> 02:36.500
THOUSANDS OF MILES BY LAND,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.100
OFTEN WALKING, TO AUSTRIA, WHERE

02:38.100 --> 02:38.933
THEY FINALLY GOT SEATS ON A BUS

02:38.933 --> 02:40.400
TO VIENNA.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.233
THEIR TIMING WAS LUCKY.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.633
TWO DAYS BEFORE GERMANY

02:43.633 --> 02:45.133
RESTRICTED ENTRIES FROM AUSTRIA,

02:45.133 --> 02:46.833
THE YAKDIS WERE MET BY HAMEED'S

02:46.833 --> 02:47.933
BROTHER, MOHAMMED, WHO ALREADY

02:47.933 --> 02:48.833
LIVED IN GERMANY.

02:48.833 --> 02:49.867
HE DROVE THEM THE REST OF THE

02:49.867 --> 02:51.600
WAY TO MUNICH.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.033
NOW, A WEEK AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL,

02:53.033 --> 02:54.300
THEY ARE STARTING TO GET A TASTE

02:54.300 --> 02:55.000
OF WHAT THEY HOPE WILL BECOME

02:55.000 --> 02:59.133
THEIR NEW HOME.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.133
>> (translated): THE WAY OF

03:01.133 --> 03:02.667
LIVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS

03:02.667 --> 03:03.967
DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF EUROPE:

03:03.967 --> 03:04.867
THE LIVING CONDITIONS, FAMILY

03:04.867 --> 03:05.933
ATMOSPHERE, EVEN THE ROADS ARE

03:05.933 --> 03:07.333
DIFFERENT.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.633
>> (translated): I FEEL SAFER

03:08.633 --> 03:10.133
THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILY HERE.

03:10.133 --> 03:11.567
ONE FEELS SAFE TO MELD INTO THE

03:11.567 --> 03:16.233
GERMAN SOCIETY.

03:16.233 --> 03:17.033
>> Reporter: LIKE TENS OF

03:17.033 --> 03:18.033
THOUSANDS OF OTHER RECENT

03:18.033 --> 03:18.967
REFUGEES, THE YAKDIS FACE A

03:18.967 --> 03:19.667
CHALLENGE THAT WILL TAKE MUCH

03:19.667 --> 03:20.733
LONGER THAN THE JOURNEY FROM

03:20.733 --> 03:22.100
SYRIA: APPLYING FOR ASYLUM AND

03:22.100 --> 03:26.100
INTEGRATING INTO GERMAN SOCIETY.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.933
THE YAKDIS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE--

03:27.933 --> 03:29.233
THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY IN MUNICH

03:29.233 --> 03:30.067
HAS TAKEN THEM IN.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.100
HAMEED'S BROTHER, MOHAMMED, CAME

03:31.100 --> 03:31.867
TO GERMANY ABOUT TWO-AND-A-HALF

03:31.867 --> 03:33.300
YEARS AGO.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.067
AND THEIR COUSIN, RUAA, CAME

03:35.067 --> 03:36.500
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, AS A REFUGEE

03:36.500 --> 03:38.233
FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN'S IRAQ.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.733
RUAA REMEMBERS THE DAUNTING

03:39.733 --> 03:40.600
CHALLENGE OF BEING THRUST INTO A

03:40.600 --> 03:42.733
DIFFERENT SOCIETY.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.433
>> IT'S NOT EASY TO LEAVE

03:44.433 --> 03:46.467
EVERYTHING BACK THERE.

03:46.467 --> 03:48.433
BUT WHEN YOU SETTLE DOWN IN

03:48.433 --> 03:50.533
ANOTHER COUNTRY, YOU FIND A JOB,

03:50.533 --> 03:53.333
YOU LEARN A LANGUAGE, YOU

03:53.333 --> 03:55.100
ESTABLISH A FAMILY, AND IT

03:55.100 --> 03:58.467
BECOMES YOUR HOME.

03:58.467 --> 04:01.467
>> Reporter: RUAA HAS MASTERED

04:01.467 --> 04:02.800
THE GERMAN LANGUAGE SO WELL THAT

04:02.800 --> 04:04.267
SHE NOW WORKS AS A TRANSLATOR.

04:04.267 --> 04:05.600
SHE WAS GRANTED ASYLUM, AND HER

04:05.600 --> 04:06.333
THREE DAUGHTERS WERE BORN AND

04:06.333 --> 04:08.300
RAISED HERE IN GERMANY.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.833
>> YOU GAIN A LOT OF RESPECT

04:09.833 --> 04:10.767
FROM THE PEOPLE HERE WHEN YOU

04:10.767 --> 04:13.300
SPEAK THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.600
>> Reporter: DO YOU FEEL

04:14.600 --> 04:20.533
ACCEPTED BY GERMANY?

04:20.533 --> 04:21.100
>> NOT ALL THE TIME.

04:21.100 --> 04:21.933
WE HAVE OUR DIFFICULTIES HERE.

04:21.933 --> 04:22.767
EVERYBODY HAS HIS OWN OPINION.

04:22.767 --> 04:23.900
I CANNOT FORCE SOMEONE TO ACCEPT

04:23.900 --> 04:25.367
ME.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.633
>> Reporter: IN RECENT YEARS,

04:26.633 --> 04:28.167
THERE HAS BEEN A RISE IN CRIMES

04:28.167 --> 04:30.133
AGAINST IMMIGRANTS BY NEO-NAZIS

04:30.133 --> 04:31.733
IN GERMANY AND IN THE FIRST HALF

04:31.733 --> 04:32.733
OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE MORE

04:32.733 --> 04:33.400
THAN 200 ATTACKS ON REFUGEE

04:33.400 --> 04:35.200
SHELTERS.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.800
BUT THE GERMANS I MET SAID THEY

04:36.800 --> 04:38.500
WELCOMED NEW ASYLUM SEEKERS LIKE

04:38.500 --> 04:40.100
THE YAKDIS, WHILE ALSO WORRYING

04:40.100 --> 04:41.700
ABOUT LONG-TERM CHALLENGES AND

04:41.700 --> 04:43.933
THE POTENTIAL FOR A BACKLASH.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.067
>> (translated): ONE HAS TO

04:45.067 --> 04:46.633
GIVE IT TIME.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.433
PREJUDICES ARE COMPLETELY BAD.

04:48.433 --> 04:49.433
HOWEVER IT PLAYS OUT, IT

04:49.433 --> 04:52.867
CERTAINLY WON'T BE EASY.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.200
>> (translated): I BELIEVE IF

04:54.200 --> 04:55.500
MANY MORE PEOPLE COME, THERE

04:55.500 --> 04:58.967
WILL BE A POINT WHEN THERE'S A

04:58.967 --> 05:00.267
REVOLT IN GERMANY, BUT AS LONG

05:00.267 --> 05:01.233
AS IT'S ONLY PEOPLE WHO REALLY

05:01.233 --> 05:02.500
NEED ASYLUM, IT'S FINE.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.267
I SAY, BETTER 1,000 REFUGEES

05:03.267 --> 05:06.300
THAN ONE NAZI.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.267
>> (translated): YES, I THINK

05:07.267 --> 05:08.100
THERE CERTAINLY IS A POTENTIAL

05:08.100 --> 05:09.267
RISK FOR GERMANY.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.367
THAT THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING

05:10.367 --> 05:12.500
GROUPS MIGHT GET STRONGER.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.833
BUT NEVERTHELESS WHEN ONE SEES

05:13.833 --> 05:15.500
HOW MUCH AID IS OFFERED TO THE

05:15.500 --> 05:16.833
REFUGEES, THEN YOU SEE THAT

05:16.833 --> 05:17.767
THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY PEOPLE

05:17.767 --> 05:19.500
WHO ARE REALLY GOOD.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.067
>> Reporter: SINCE ARRIVING IN

05:21.067 --> 05:22.867
2013, MOHAMMED YAKDI SAYS

05:22.867 --> 05:23.833
OVERALL HE HAS HAD A GOOD

05:23.833 --> 05:25.500
EXPERIENCE IN GERMANY.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.833
HE'S SPEAKING GERMAN AND HAS A

05:26.833 --> 05:28.033
JOB AS A FOOD DELIVERY TRUCK

05:28.033 --> 05:29.133
DRIVER.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.200
BUT AT TIMES, HE CAN FEEL THE

05:30.200 --> 05:33.700
PREJUDICE.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.633
>> I HAVE ALWAYS ALWAYS STRESS.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.067
I CANNOT FEEL THIS MY HOME.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.033
I NEED MORE TIME.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.500
>> Reporter: FOR THE TWO

05:39.500 --> 05:40.833
YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE YAKDI

05:40.833 --> 05:41.933
FAMILY, THREE-YEAR-OLD ADAM AND

05:41.933 --> 05:43.000
FOUR-YEAR-OLD FATEN,

05:43.000 --> 05:43.933
ASSIMILATION SHOULD BE EASIER

05:43.933 --> 05:45.867
AND QUICKER.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.567
LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ALL ASYLUM

05:47.567 --> 05:49.133
SEEKERS, GERMAN LAW REQUIRES

05:49.133 --> 05:50.433
THEY BE ENROLLED IN PUBLIC

05:50.433 --> 05:52.433
SCHOOL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.567
>> NOW, I DON'T THINK ABOUT ME,

05:54.567 --> 05:56.167
ABOUT WHAT I WILL DO.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.533
I THINK ABOUT THEM, ABOUT WHAT

05:57.533 --> 05:59.333
THEY WILL DO IN THE FUTURE.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.500
I SEE THE OTHER CHILDREN HERE,

06:01.500 --> 06:02.933
AND THEY GO TO SCHOOL, THEY

06:02.933 --> 06:06.100
STUDY, AND THEY HAVE FUTURE.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.500
>> Reporter: BUT EVEN AS THEY

06:07.500 --> 06:09.133
TRY TO BECOME PART OF GERMAN

06:09.133 --> 06:10.567
SOCIETY, THE YAKDIS WANT THEIR

06:10.567 --> 06:11.367
CHILDREN TO KNOW THEY WILL

06:11.367 --> 06:14.500
ALWAYS BE SYRIAN.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.733
>> (translated): I WILL

06:15.733 --> 06:16.767
CONTINUE TO BE CONSISTENT

06:16.767 --> 06:17.967
REMINDING THEM THAT WE ARE

06:17.967 --> 06:19.500
SYRIANS, THERE DEFINITELY WILL

06:19.500 --> 06:20.533
BE PART OF THEM FROM THE

06:20.533 --> 06:21.500
HOMELAND THAT THEY WILL NEVER

06:21.500 --> 06:22.867
FORGET.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.333
SO WHEN THEY GROW UP, THEY WILL

06:24.333 --> 06:25.933
LIVE WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY,

06:25.933 --> 06:30.233
BUT THEY WILL REMAIN SYRIANS.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.433
BEEN SPEAKING SAYING NOW HE HAS

07:47.433 --> 07:49.133
A MANDATE FOR FOUR YEARS THAT

07:49.133 --> 07:50.900
THE GREEK PEOPLE ARE BACKING HIM

07:50.900 --> 07:52.533
TO DO FIGHT IN HIS PARTICULAR

07:52.533 --> 07:53.467
CORNER.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.000
HE PORTRAYED THIS As A

07:55.000 --> 07:57.433
SUBSTANTIAL VICTORY BUT IT'S NOT

07:57.433 --> 07:58.633
ONE, TO BE POLL HONEST.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.133
THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN DEFINED

08:00.133 --> 08:02.333
BY THE APATHY OF THE GREEK

08:02.333 --> 08:03.333
PEOPLE.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.733
THERE'S COMPLETE DESPAIR WITH

08:04.733 --> 08:05.500
POLITICIANS AND POLITICS.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.833
BECAUSE THIS IS A COUNTRY WHICH

08:07.833 --> 08:08.867
IS PASSIONATE ABOUT POLITICS.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.800
PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED SUPPOSEDLY

08:10.800 --> 08:12.500
TO GO TO VOTE BUT THE MOST

08:12.500 --> 08:14.700
IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT 45%

08:14.700 --> 08:16.767
OF THE PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE

08:16.767 --> 08:17.700
TODAY.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.500
THEY'RE SO COMPLETELY

08:20.500 --> 08:22.267
DISILLUSIONED AND WHEN ALEX WAS

08:22.267 --> 08:23.200
FIRST ELECTED IN JANUARY HE WAS

08:23.200 --> 08:26.067
ON A WAVE OF HOPE THAT WAS GOING

08:26.067 --> 08:26.867
TO CHANGE THINGS.

08:26.867 --> 08:28.533
BUT HE HAS DISAPPOINTED SO MANY

08:28.533 --> 08:29.500
PEOPLE.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.733
HE MAY HAVE GONE IN TODAY WITH

08:30.733 --> 08:36.233
THE HELP OF HIS PREVIOUS RIGHT

08:36.233 --> 08:37.867
WING COLLEAGUES TO FORM A

08:37.867 --> 08:38.500
MAJORITY GOVERNMENT.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
SOME PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR HIM

08:40.500 --> 08:42.333
SAID YOU PUT US IN A REAL MESS,

08:42.333 --> 08:43.500
NOW YOU CAN FINISH THE JOB.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.933
>> THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN THAT

08:44.933 --> 08:48.167
HE GOT IN ON THE MANDATE OF

08:48.167 --> 08:49.867
STANDING AGAINST THE AUSTERITY

08:49.867 --> 08:51.767
MEASURES AND HE CAPITULATED TO

08:51.767 --> 08:55.167
THE REST OF EUROPE?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.467
>> WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE

08:57.467 --> 09:01.867
THINGS THAT IS QUITE DROLL ABOUT

09:01.867 --> 09:04.167
THE WHOLE OF GREECE.

09:04.167 --> 09:07.567
EARLIER TODAY YOU HAD THE

09:07.567 --> 09:09.667
MINISTER WHO IS FORMING THE

09:09.667 --> 09:11.800
RIGHT WING COALITION SAYING THIS

09:11.800 --> 09:13.567
IS A TIME FOR A NEW BEGINNING

09:13.567 --> 09:16.500
AND TIME FOR GREECE TO GET TRUST

09:16.500 --> 09:17.633
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRUST

09:17.633 --> 09:19.767
BECAUSE HE PROMISED SO MUCH,

09:19.767 --> 09:21.533
ESPECIALLY IN THE ELECTORATE AND

09:21.533 --> 09:24.767
WHEN THEY VOTED NO IN THIS

09:24.767 --> 09:26.533
REFERENDUM IN TERMS OF AUSTERITY

09:26.533 --> 09:28.133
MEASURES HE COMPLETELY IGNORED

09:28.133 --> 09:30.633
THAT AND CAPITULATED TO THE

09:30.633 --> 09:31.967
EUROPEAN UNION AND THERE WAS A

09:31.967 --> 09:33.133
TAXI DRIVER THAT BROUGHT HE HERE

09:33.133 --> 09:35.100
TONIGHT THAT CAME UP WITH A VERY

09:35.100 --> 09:36.533
INSTRUCTIVE QUOTE AND HE SAID, I

09:36.533 --> 09:38.300
DON'T CARE IF WE HAD A SOCIALIST

09:38.300 --> 09:39.500
OR A CONSERVATIVE.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.633
HE SAID COME MONDAY MORNING WE

09:40.633 --> 09:41.533
WON'T HAVE A PRIME MINISTER.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.833
WE WILL HAVE A DUTCH PERSON

09:43.833 --> 09:45.000
TELLING US WHAT TO DO.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.333
THAT'S THE WAY MANY GREEKS FEEL.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.500
THAT HE IS A PRIME MINISTER IN

09:49.500 --> 09:51.133
NAME ONLY BECAUSE HIS POLICIES

09:51.133 --> 09:52.900
ARE BEING DICTATED BY THE

09:52.900 --> 09:53.900
EUROPEAN UNION.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.067
>> FINALLY WHILE I STILL HAVE

09:56.067 --> 09:57.733
YOU, THIS HAPPENS AT A TIME, AS

09:57.733 --> 10:00.033
YOU HAVE DOCUMENTED, GREECE IS

10:00.033 --> 10:02.500
ON THE FRONTLINES IN MANY CASES

10:02.500 --> 10:06.900
OF THE MIGRANT CRISES AS WELL.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.000
>> ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING

10:09.000 --> 10:09.800
THINGS INTERNATIONALLY REALLY

10:09.800 --> 10:11.233
ABSENT THE NEW GOVERNMENT COMING

10:11.233 --> 10:14.600
BACK INTO POWER IS THAT HE HAS

10:14.600 --> 10:16.900
BEEN TALKING ABOUT TEARING DOWN

10:16.900 --> 10:19.000
THE FENCE, WHICH SEPARATES

10:19.000 --> 10:20.500
GREECE AND TURKEY.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.600
NOW THAT FENCE IS ONE OF THE

10:22.600 --> 10:24.300
REASONS WHY ALL OF THE MIGRANTS

10:24.300 --> 10:26.667
HAVE BEEN COMING ACROSS VIA BOAT

10:26.667 --> 10:27.533
INTO THE ISLANDS.

10:27.533 --> 10:32.733
NOW HE IS VERY MUCH A PRO

10:32.733 --> 10:34.700
REFUGEE AND HE MIGHT SAVE ALL OF

10:34.700 --> 10:36.067
THE MY GRANTS FROM COMING ACROSS

10:36.067 --> 10:37.533
THE WATER GUESS HE GOES THERE

10:37.533 --> 10:38.933
AND PULLS DOWN THE FENCE.

10:38.933 --> 10:40.633
HE HAS TO GET POLITICAL SUPPORT

10:40.633 --> 10:42.600
TO DO THAT BUT THAT IS A FAIRLY

10:42.600 --> 10:43.700
MAJOR THING TO LOOK AHEAD TO IN

10:43.700 --> 10:44.633
THE FUTURE.

10:44.633 --> 10:45.667

15:47.600 --> 15:48.700
HERE THEY CAN COUNT ON LEARNING

15:48.700 --> 15:50.267
AND AFFECTION.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.767
IT'S A REFUGE FOR THEM, SO THEY

15:52.767 --> 15:54.633
CAN FEEL CONNECTED TO A MOMENT

15:54.633 --> 16:00.833
OF PEACE AND PLEASURE.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.767
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, THIS

16:02.767 --> 16:04.500
LITTLE BOY, JEFFERSON, LOOKED AT

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
ME, A NEW TEACHER, A LITTLE

16:05.500 --> 16:14.067
SCARED AND SHY.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.633
GENERALLY THE KIDS ARE VERY

16:15.633 --> 16:17.267
HYPER AND NEVER STOP.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.133
BUT JEFFERSON IS DIFFERENT.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.133
HE SITS IN HIS LITTLE SPOT AND

16:20.133 --> 16:26.367
WAITS FOR MY ORDERS.

IS IT SWEET, SALTY OR BITTER?

16:32.867 --> 16:33.633
INTERESTING IS THAT HE ALREADY

16:33.633 --> 16:35.233
KNOWS HOW TO READ.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.700
GENERALLY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.733
MOST OF THE KIDS AREN'T READING

17:00.233 --> 17:01.533
DANGERS OF ROCINHA WORRY HIS

17:01.533 --> 17:06.267
MOTHER LESLIE EVEN MORE.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.700
>> (translated): LIKE ANY

17:19.767 --> 17:21.033
BECOME A WHORE AND THAT MY SON

17:21.033 --> 17:21.867
WILL BECOME A DRUG DEALER WHEN

17:21.867 --> 17:27.333
HE GROWS UP.

THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME.

JEFFERSON HAS A FRIEND THREE

17:35.367 --> 17:36.733
YEARS OLDER THAN HIM WHO IS NOW

17:36.733 --> 17:40.633
A DRUG DEALER.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.767
SO I SAY TO HIM, "IF YOU CHOOSE

17:42.767 --> 17:44.500
TO FOLLOW HIS PATH, YOU'LL HAVE

17:44.500 --> 17:49.300
TWO OPTIONS DEATH OR PRISON."
