CURTAILING FOOD WASTE MAY BE

17:51.767 --> 17:52.900
EASIER THAN IT SEEMS

17:52.900 --> 17:54.200
HE SAYS THAT'S BECAUSE ALMOS

17:54.200 --> 17:55.833
HALF THE FOOD IN THIS COUNTR

17:55.833 --> 17:57.533
GOES THROUGH SIX MAJOR

OF ACTORS WHO COULD MAKE A BIG

18:27.933 --> 18:28.633
BIG DIFFERENCE
