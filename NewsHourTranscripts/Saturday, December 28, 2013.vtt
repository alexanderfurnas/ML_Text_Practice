03:55.933 --> 03:58.100
THE BENEFIT IS $300 A WEEK

03:58.100 --> 04:00.767
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT IS T

ESSENTIALS LIKE GROCERIES,

04:02.733 --> 04:03.700
PHARMACIES AND GAS

04:26.000 --> 04:27.833
JOB TODAY THAN FIVE YEARS AGO?

04:27.833 --> 04:30.200

THERE ARE 2.97 PEOPLE FOR EVER

AND THEY HAVE MOVED INTO THE

05:20.500 --> 05:21.567

05:21.567 --> 05:23.767
SO THEY ARE ALREADY OUT OF WOR

05:23.767 --> 05:26.233
FOR SOME TIME.

05:26.233 --> 05:28.500
SO THEY -- WITHOUT THIS BENEFIT,

THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE A JOB

05:43.433 --> 05:44.733
IS IT ON THE AGENDA.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.033
THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF THE

05:59.367 --> 06:00.900
IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED MORE THAN

06:00.900 --> 06:01.967
TEN TIMES.

06:01.967 --> 06:05.533

12 THROUGH DECEMBER 13

06:07.133 --> 06:08.900
THIS IS NOT AN ENORMOU

06:08.900 --> 06:10.167

RENEWAL IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.867
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

06:17.867 --> 06:19.767
MANY REPUBLICANS SAID WE WANT TO

06:19.767 --> 06:22.033
SEE OFFSETTING CUTS AND THAT

06:22.033 --> 06:24.667
DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BUDGE

PACKAGE.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.700
THIS THREE MONTH POSSIBL

06:26.700 --> 06:28.500
EXTENSION WOULD ALLOW LAWMAKER

06:28.500 --> 06:30.967
TO TWEAK THE PROGRAM TO FIND

06:30.967 --> 06:33.033
OFFSETTING CUTS AND TO PERHAPS

06:33.033 --> 06:35.600
TWEAK IT SO IT IS NOT AS

06:35.600 --> 06:37.167
GENEROUS AS IT WAS

06:37.167 --> 06:39.233
AS FAR AS PASSAGE?

06:39.233 --> 06:40.967

06:40.967 --> 06:43.600
VOTE ON THE 6th AND 7th.
