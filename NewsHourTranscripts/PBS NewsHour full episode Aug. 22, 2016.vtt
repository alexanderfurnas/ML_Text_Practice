JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.939 --> 00:06.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
latest look
at the money the presidential
nominees are

00:12.212 --> 00:14.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
raising and spending.

00:14.147 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We break down how the candidates
compare on
campaign cash.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: running towards danger.

00:21.154 --> 00:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Known as the White Helmets,
Syria's civil
defense rescue teams search for
lives in the

00:26.960 --> 00:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rubble while risking their own.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RADI SAAD, Rescue Worker
(through translator):
You get tired, but the hope
inside you makes

00:32.332 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you forget, and you just keep
going to try
to reach the person who needs
your help.

00:36.270 --> 00:43.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an Islamic
militant apologizes
for destroying religious
monuments in Timbuktu

00:43.710 --> 00:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the first ever war crimes
trial for cultural
destruction.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's a
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.951 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.355 --> 01:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
presidential hopeful
Donald Trump insisted today he's
not flip-flopping

01:08.835 --> 01:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his plan to deport some 11
million people
living in the U.S. illegally.

01:14.141 --> 01:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That came after his campaign
appeared to signal
a shift in his immigration
policy over the

01:20.047 --> 01:21.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

01:21.949 --> 01:25.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, Democratic vice
presidential
nominee Tim Kaine said that
Trump's conflicting

01:25.819 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
messages show he can't be
trusted.

01:27.988 --> 01:32.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
the campaign
right after this news summary.

01:32.192 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in Texas has
temporarily blocked
the Obama administration's
guidelines on transgender

01:39.299 --> 01:41.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bathroom policies in public
schools.

01:41.735 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They permitted students to use
restrooms that
correspond to their chosen
gender identity.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The district court judge granted
the nationwide
injunction late Sunday, a move
that had been

01:52.446 --> 01:54.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sought by 13 states.

01:54.514 --> 01:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, White House spokesman
Josh Earnest
defended the president's
directive today in

01:59.252 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
Our goal has been from the
beginning to provide

02:04.291 --> 02:10.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the safety, and security,
and dignity
of students all across the
country.

02:10.230 --> 02:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We certainly have the confidence
in the legal
basis for issuing that guidance.

02:15.202 --> 02:20.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, obviously, we're respectful
of rulings
that are put forward by federal
judges.

02:20.774 --> 02:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will let my colleagues at
the Department
of Justice speak to the next
step in the legal

02:25.645 --> 02:27.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

02:27.381 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will explore
the implications
of the Texas ruling later in the
program.

02:32.853 --> 02:38.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia has stopped using an
Iranian military
base to launch airstrikes in
Syria, for now.

02:38.625 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement came just hours
after Iran's
foreign minister criticized
Moscow for publicizing

02:44.598 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their actions.

02:46.366 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, airstrikes continued
across Syria
today, that as U.S. Secretary of
State John

02:51.238 --> 02:57.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry on a trip to Kenya said
talks with Russia
on stemming the violence are --
quote -- "reaching

02:57.210 --> 02:58.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
an end."

02:58.979 --> 03:02.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It is
possible that something could be
agreed at

03:02.282 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- upon before the end of the
month, but I
can't tell you whether it's
likely.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wouldn't express optimism.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would express hope.

03:11.324 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will say this.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has to end, this Syrian
travesty.

03:20.600 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today: A
Kurdish militia
launched a major assault on the
northeastern

03:26.673 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city of Hasakah to seize the
last remaining
government-held areas there.

03:32.179 --> 03:38.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll from a weekend
suicide attack
at a wedding in Turkey has risen
to 54 people.

03:38.618 --> 03:45.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At least 22 victims in
Saturday's bombing
near the Syrian border were
younger than 14.

03:45.192 --> 03:50.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials and residents cleaned
up around
the attack site today, as
relatives buried

03:50.163 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their loved ones.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey's foreign minister vowed
to battle
the Islamic State group.

03:55.235 --> 04:00.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEVLUT CAVUSOGLU, Turkish
Foreign Minister
(through translator): We will
fight against

04:00.073 --> 04:04.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic State and other
terrorist organizations
until the end.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will continue to support
countries
and forces who are also fighting
it.

04:07.914 --> 04:12.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As you know, the Syrian
opposition's operations
at our border were concluded
successfully.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, our border needs
to be completely
cleansed of ISIS.

04:15.789 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ISIS has yet to
officially
claim responsibility for the
wedding massacre.

04:20.961 --> 04:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they have been blamed for
similar attacks
in the country in the past.

04:25.232 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Philippines, there's been
a dramatic
spike in the number of people
killed as part

04:29.636 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of all crackdown on drugs.

04:31.538 --> 04:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It began after new President
Rodrigo Duterte
took office seven weeks ago.

04:36.776 --> 04:43.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 1,800 drug suspects have
now been killed;
712 of them died in police
clashes.

04:43.917 --> 04:48.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's up from 525 earlier this
month.

04:48.188 --> 04:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more than 1,000 other people
were killed
by vigilante groups.

04:53.059 --> 04:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tokyo was battered by heavy rain
and strong
winds today after a powerful
typhoon made

04:58.465 --> 05:01.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
landfall just south of the
Japanese capital.

05:01.935 --> 05:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 500,000 residents were
advised to evacuate,
and at least one person died.

05:08.108 --> 05:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Winds gusted up to 112 miles an
hour across
the city, and swollen rivers
sparked fears

05:14.181 --> 05:15.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of flooding.

05:15.815 --> 05:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, a commuter train
derailed, and
hundreds of flights were
grounded.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
India is contending with its own
deluge today.

05:24.291 --> 05:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 40 people have died in
flooding that's
inundated central and eastern
parts of the

05:29.596 --> 05:30.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds of thousands of people
have been
forced to flee.

05:33.767 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Days of heavy rain caused the
Ganges River
to rise above its danger level.

05:38.805 --> 05:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's all part of India's monsoon
season, which
runs from June through
September.

05:45.245 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks were mostly lower on Wall
Street today,
as a drop in oil prices dragged
down energy

05:50.584 --> 05:51.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shares.

05:51.952 --> 05:57.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 23 points
to close at 18529.

05:57.357 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose six points, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped a point.

06:02.462 --> 06:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte
lost all
four of his major sponsors
today, Speedo,

06:09.035 --> 06:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ralph Lauren, skin care firm
Syneron-Candela,
and Airweave Mattress announced
they're ending

06:15.575 --> 06:20.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their endorsements, after the
swimmer's drunken
incident during the Rio
Olympics.

06:20.747 --> 06:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speedo plans to donate $50,000
of Lochte's
fee to Save the Children in
order to help

06:26.920 --> 06:28.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the needy in Brazil.

06:28.955 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lochte has apologized for making
the claim
he made about an armed robbery.

06:34.327 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
where the
Clinton campaign is vastly
outspending Donald

06:39.299 --> 06:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump; the issues still plaguing
the two candidates
less than three months before
Election Day;

06:45.338 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first-responders behind the
image that
caught the world's attention;
and much more.

06:55.382 --> 07:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first-responders behind the
image that
caught the world's attention;
and much more.

07:02.789 --> 07:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin tonight with politics,
and the role
of money in the campaign for the
White House.

07:07.627 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Federal Election Commission
reports spell
out how much each of the
candidates has raised

07:12.832 --> 07:14.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and spent so far.

07:14.734 --> 07:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the Democrats, Hillary
Clinton spent nearly
$49 million in July, while
Republican Donald

07:21.041 --> 07:26.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump spent $18.4 million, a
little over a
third of what Clinton spent.

07:26.212 --> 07:33.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the race began, the
Clinton campaign
has spent $319 million, while
the Trump campaign

07:33.086 --> 07:35.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has spent $89.5 million.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We catch up on all of this now
with Matea
Gold.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She covers money and influence
for The Washington
Post.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you back to the
"NewsHour."

07:42.429 --> 07:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
Great to
be with you.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Matea, when
you look at
these numbers that we have just
cited of what

07:47.467 --> 07:51.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these two candidates have spent,
what does
that tell you about their
priorities?

07:51.204 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: ®MD+IT /MD-IT /Well,
I have
to say, when Donald Trump's
filing came in

07:54.140 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
late Saturday night, it was
incredibly surprising.

07:56.609 --> 08:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had actually had a very
successful fund-raising
month in July.

08:00.347 --> 08:04.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actually almost matched
Clinton and the
DNC through his fund-raising in
conjunction

08:04.918 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the RNC.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we expected to see a lot of
spending.

08:07.854 --> 08:12.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, really, this is a
reflection of the completely
unorthodox approach that Trump
has taken to

08:12.125 --> 08:13.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this campaign.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actually really has scoffed
at some of
the traditional campaign
investments that

08:17.430 --> 08:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you see campaigns making over
the years.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for one, he doesn't believe
in expensive
TV ads.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's just starting that right
now.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he hasn't built a big
infrastructure on
the ground.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those are the two big
differences.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking --
one way to
look at infrastructure, I guess,
is the number

08:32.512 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of staff they have hired.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look at that and you see
that in these
numbers of what you found in
their filings.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Yes, it's really
remarkable, Judy.

08:41.654 --> 08:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by the end of July, Clinton
had 705 paid
staffers, and Trump had 82,
barely just maybe

08:49.929 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a half-dozen more than he had in
June.

08:51.731 --> 08:56.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a period of time that
both of the
candidates were receiving their
nominations

08:56.302 --> 09:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the conventions, a time when
candidates
traditionally are gearing up for
the final

09:01.040 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
four months of campaign.

09:02.876 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, what's happening
here is Donald
Trump is leaning on the
Republican National

09:07.881 --> 09:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, the national party,
to provide
the kind of ground voter
motivation that often

09:13.353 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
usually the candidate takes the
lead in doing.

09:15.588 --> 09:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you
contrast, I think,
the size of -- the small size of
Donald Trump's

09:19.893 --> 09:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff compared to previous
presidential campaigns,
it's really -- it's a notable
difference.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: No, there is no
comparison.

09:27.667 --> 09:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what of the things that I
think worries
actually Trump allies is that
he's too vulnerable

09:32.639 --> 09:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by leaning on the RNC in this
way.

09:35.308 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump's numbers do not
improve late in
the fall, if the RNC decides to
have its folks

09:40.914 --> 09:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground focus on Senate
and House candidates,
as opposed to really pushing
their presidential

09:45.985 --> 09:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate, he really won't have
anyone there
to make up the difference.

09:49.389 --> 09:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Matea, you
also told us,
it's interesting when you look
at these numbers,

09:53.426 --> 09:56.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how much they spent on
television on advertising.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you find there?

09:57.464 --> 09:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: They're really
mind-blowing.

09:59.232 --> 10:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the end of July, Clinton's
campaign had
already spent $108 million on TV
production

10:04.237 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and airtime.

10:05.638 --> 10:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just announced today
another $80 million
on national cable.

10:09.542 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, by comparison, last week
launched his
first general election ad, $4.8
million.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what is the
campaign -- what
is the Trump camp saying about
this?

10:18.651 --> 10:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: So, their argument
is, they don't
need television in the way that
she does.

10:22.422 --> 10:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has a huge megaphone through
earned media,
as we have talked about already
in this election.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His every remark, every
speech...

10:28.561 --> 10:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: News coverage.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Exactly.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His every remark and every tweet
gets incredibly
amplified through the media.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he reaches people directly
through social
media, so they really don't feel
like they

10:38.505 --> 10:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to spend in the ways that
she does.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, we saw that this
race was very
tight up and through the summer
until the

10:44.811 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conventions, at the time she was
spending
a lot on television.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that validated their theory
of theirs.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, let's look,
Matea, at
where the money is coming from.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campaigns confirmed some
numbers we actually
saw a few days ago, that she
raised aids about

10:56.022 --> 11:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$90 million in July, he raised
about $82 million.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like relative parity
there, but
what more is there to see?

11:04.931 --> 11:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, one of the
mysteries of
Trump's filing is why there
wasn't more in

11:08.535 --> 11:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his actual campaign account by
the end of
the month.

11:12.105 --> 11:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His campaign has said they had
raised about
$64 million online and through
direct mail

11:17.477 --> 11:18.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the party.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thought we would see most of
that in his
campaign.

11:20.947 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ended up just reporting $36
million in
his campaign, which suggests a
lot of that

11:25.585 --> 11:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money hasn't been transferred
over from the
joint fund-raising committee or
has been spent

11:29.989 --> 11:30.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in another way.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

11:32.025 --> 11:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just stop
you there.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Sure.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Explain the
difference between
the joint fund-raising committee
and the campaign,

11:37.196 --> 11:38.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those two pots.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MATEA GOLD: Yes.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's -- both of the
candidates actually
are working through two joint
fund-raising

11:42.569 --> 11:44.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committees.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically a committee that
raises money
for both the campaign and the
national party

11:47.907 --> 11:49.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and splits the proceeds.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a share of the money that
goes into
the joint fund-raising committee
legally goes

11:53.246 --> 11:54.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the campaign.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another share goes to the
national party.

11:56.015 --> 11:59.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, usually, the small
donations end up with
the campaign.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And those are really
traditionally the most
valuable, because the candidate
controls that

12:03.823 --> 12:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money and can really direct
those resources.

12:05.658 --> 12:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
small donations,
it's interesting how much of the
money -- to

12:09.462 --> 12:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at how much came from
donors giving $200
or less, with Clinton, $62
million, 18 percent

12:18.404 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what she raised.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, for Trump, it was 30 --
over 30 percent.

12:21.207 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: There is no question
that, as
soon as he finally began
fund-raising, he

12:24.744 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tapped into incredible
enthusiasm among his
supporters, and, in fact,
caught, I think,

12:29.282 --> 12:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Clinton campaign by surprise
with how
much money he was able to raise
so quickly

12:34.053 --> 12:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
online through small donors.

12:36.189 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's also put in a large
share of his
own money, $52 million by the
end of July,

12:42.061 --> 12:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into this presidential bid.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One month's reporting, there's a
lot there.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matea Gold with The Washington
Post, we thank
you.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Thank you.

12:50.703 --> 12:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now let's
turn to Politics
Monday with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

12:55.608 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Report, Tamara Keith of NPR.

12:57.543 --> 13:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Amy and Tam, let's talk
about what Matea
was just reporting.

13:02.415 --> 13:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, when you hear these numbers
and you see
what Donald Trump is spending,
what Hillary

13:07.920 --> 13:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is spending money on,
what does that
tell you about the state of
these campaigns?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
I think Matea put it quite well.

13:13.926 --> 13:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're just dealing with two very
different
theories of the case here.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Donald Trump campaign
is, he's operating
-- it's like in a parallel
universe, where

13:22.001 --> 13:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the normal rules of campaigning
don't apply.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You don't need staff.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't need advertising, that
your megaphone
being this media coverage is
going to be enough

13:31.544 --> 13:32.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's clear that that's not
really working
anymore.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see it in these
battleground states,
especially states where Hillary
Clinton has

13:38.618 --> 13:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been spending a great deal of
money.

13:40.620 --> 13:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is falling behind,
in some cases,
falling so far behind that the
Clinton campaign

13:45.324 --> 13:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is saying, look, we have a
state like
Virginia -- that's a
battleground state -- Colorado,

13:50.263 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battleground state, they're
not going to
advertise there anymore because
they feel

13:53.700 --> 13:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so confident with their lead in
those states.

13:55.935 --> 14:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, it's
interesting
that you're able to say
something like this,

14:00.273 --> 14:01.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this early.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I realize it's November.

14:03.476 --> 14:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's two-and-a-half months away,
but it's
still -- there is still time to
go in this

14:08.981 --> 14:10.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
and the Clinton campaign does
point out that

14:12.218 --> 14:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they could reverse course and
start running
ads in those states.

14:14.053 --> 14:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have been since June
really pushing
this message very hard that
Donald Trump is

14:21.127 --> 14:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "temperamentally
unfit," that
he shouldn't have his finger
near the button.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're out with a new ad on
that topic again
today.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have really been driving
that message.

14:33.673 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I went to a
Donald Trump event
last week and was talking to his
supporters,

14:38.945 --> 14:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they'd all seen Hillary
Clinton's ads.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huh.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

14:44.217 --> 14:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even building on Matea's
thing, the group
called Open Secrets, which also
looks at campaign

14:51.124 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending, their analysis found
that the RNC
now has less in the bank at this
point in

14:55.495 --> 14:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign than they have in
the last three
elections.

14:58.397 --> 15:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 2004, 2008, 2012, they had
more money
in the bank at this time than
they do now.

15:03.436 --> 15:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The DCCC, which is the House
arm, fund-raising
arm for the Democrats, outraised
House Republicans

15:09.776 --> 15:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in July by three times as much.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this isn't just about the
Trump campaign.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This could trickle down into the
others as
well.

15:16.115 --> 15:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And what is
notable about those
RNC numbers is that Donald Trump
is leaning

15:19.619 --> 15:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so heavily on the RNC to do most
of the basic
fundamentals of a campaign.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the RNC has less money than
it's had in
the past.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, I want
to quickly
move on to another issue that
has been bubbling

15:30.096 --> 15:32.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up again.

15:32.098 --> 15:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On CNN yesterday, Trump's new
campaign manager,
Kellyanne, was asked whether
Trump, as president,

15:36.402 --> 15:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for push for deportation forces
-- this is
a term he has used -- to remove
undocumented

15:41.541 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigrants from the United
States.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Conway said -- quote -- "That is
to be determined."

15:45.745 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was something that Trump
had called
for previously.

15:49.081 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on FOX News, in a phone
interview this
morning, Trump was asked whether
he has changed

15:54.220 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his mind.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I will tell you, we're dealing
with people.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to be very firm.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to be very, very strong
when people
come in illegally.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a lot of people that
want to come
in through the legal process.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not fair for them.

16:06.933 --> 16:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're working with a lot of
people in
the Hispanic community to try
and come up

16:11.571 --> 16:12.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with an answer.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: So, you're not
flip-flopping?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not
flip-flopping.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to come up with really
fair, but firm
answer.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has to be very firm.

16:19.679 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, later today
at a union
convention in Las Vegas,
Democratic vice presidential

16:24.450 --> 16:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee Tim Kaine told the
people there they
shouldn't be swayed by Trump's
new talk of

16:28.754 --> 16:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a firm, but fair immigration
plan.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
He's not changing his policies,
not by an

16:33.893 --> 16:34.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
inch.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is still going to have the
deportation
force.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is still going to have
separate families.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says he's not flip-flopping
on immigration.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what his campaign says.

16:43.903 --> 16:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we can't afford to be
tricked by Trump.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This deportation thing is just
another one.

16:49.075 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is saying that he will try to
deport people
in a humane way, whatever that
means.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's just wrong.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, what is
going on here?

16:57.650 --> 17:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we think is the thinking
in Trump's
mind?

17:00.753 --> 17:02.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it's clear from
listening to his
campaign surrogates and even
listening to

17:05.524 --> 17:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump in these last couple of
days, he understands
there's a softening that needs
to happen around

17:10.897 --> 17:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of these issues, especially
something
like mass deportation of 11
million immigrants.

17:16.135 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also clear that it's
really late
in the game to change people's
perceptions

17:20.206 --> 17:21.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of him.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm sure you see this, hear the
same thing.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you sit with a group of
voters and ask
them, what do you know about
Donald Trump,

17:25.411 --> 17:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first thing they will say is
the wall.

17:27.446 --> 17:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing they will say
is a ban on
Muslims.

17:30.549 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having a deportation, having
this fight over
deportation, I don't think, is
going to change

17:34.086 --> 17:37.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the basic perception that voters
have of Donald
Trump.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It sounds like
there is some
kind of battle going on, though,
inside the

17:39.825 --> 17:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump camp, Tamara, because
earlier today
we were told that he was going
to make a speech

17:44.597 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on immigration.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we learn it's not going
to happen
this week.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Right, and that
maybe it's still
a work in progress.

17:50.836 --> 17:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it will be hard to
know exactly
what his position is or whether
it's changed

17:55.908 --> 18:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on immigration until we hear
that speech,
and even once we do hear the
speech, it may

18:00.079 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be hard to know precisely what
the policy
proposal is.

18:04.016 --> 18:08.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has talked about a
deportation force before,
and then said it would be
humane, they could

18:08.187 --> 18:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take their family with them, the
citizen members
of their family with them.

18:12.625 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at this point, it's really
not clear to
me whether there is movement
happening or

18:18.831 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And who it's aimed
at.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Some of this is
aimed at making
those white college suburban
voters who have

18:25.705 --> 18:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been moving away from Donald
Trump more comfortable
with him and his rhetoric.

18:29.442 --> 18:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, why those
voters, especially
if you talk to a lot of women
voters who live

18:33.646 --> 18:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in those suburban areas, the
number one concern
they have about Donald Trump is
his temperament

18:38.017 --> 18:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the idea of him as commander
in chief,
which is why Hillary Clinton
campaign out

18:41.654 --> 18:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today making a very clear
statement about
his temperament and his fitness
for office

18:49.161 --> 18:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the concept that Tam
mentioned.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you really want this guy with
his finger
on the button?

18:53.899 --> 19:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campaign ends -- the ad ends
with the
sound of jet fighters is this
the risk -- basically

19:00.239 --> 19:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, is this the risk you
want to take?

19:01.974 --> 19:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
the immigration
story continues boiling.

19:06.412 --> 19:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Hillary Clinton's part, Tam,
though, the
e-mail story keeps bubbling.

19:10.349 --> 19:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are three different
strands of it
today, what appears to be the
difference she's

19:14.620 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had with former Secretary of
State Colin Powell,
who is saying that he thinks the
Clinton camp

19:20.960 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to pin the e-mail
problem on him
because she told the FBI that
she got the

19:26.165 --> 19:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea for personal -- using
personal e-mail
from General Powell.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you have got two other
stories that the
State Department is going to be
releasing

19:35.441 --> 19:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15,000 previously undisclosed
e-mails sometime
in October, and then another
strand of e-mails

19:41.747 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today having to do with the
Clinton Foundation
exchanging notes with Clinton's
aide.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just destined to be with
us until
Election Day?

19:51.557 --> 19:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You think it will
stop then?

19:52.958 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:53.959 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's going to stop
with Election
Day.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: I agree.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: On the Colin
Powell thing, he
has reportedly said: I told her
that I used

20:01.700 --> 20:02.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my AOL account.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That worked better.

20:04.470 --> 20:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He, by no means -- nobody is
arguing that
he said, go put a server in your
basement.

20:08.507 --> 20:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you know, there is that.

20:12.211 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judicial Watch, which is a
conservative group
that has been looking for
problems for Hillary

20:17.349 --> 20:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, has been releasing a
steady stream
of e-mails.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some of this is part of
that.

20:23.222 --> 20:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is this question that
keeps coming
up about the Clinton Foundation
and the relationship

20:28.794 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between staff at the Clinton
Foundation and
staff at the State Department
who worked for

20:32.198 --> 20:33.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Clinton campaign would
say in response
to all of that is that there is
no evidence

20:37.570 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the she did favors for anyone,
that Secretary
Clinton did.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Amy, the
bottom line is,
does this hurt her?

20:42.541 --> 20:43.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It keeps coming back to, well,
two things.

20:45.811 --> 20:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're going to pin something
on somebody,
first, make sure they know that
you are going

20:49.348 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, second, make sure they have
a buy-in.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

20:52.351 --> 20:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You probably should do both
those things.

20:54.320 --> 21:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the second is, we just live
in a world
that's very different from the
way it was

21:00.259 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 or 30 years ago in the way
that people
view institutions and the sense
of distrust

21:07.066 --> 21:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and dysfunction about whether
it's about government,
whether it's about corporations,
whether it's

21:12.171 --> 21:13.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about the media.

21:13.806 --> 21:18.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so any appearance of
impropriety is going
to be taken very, very
seriously.

21:18.177 --> 21:23.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The issue now -- or the
watchword really is
transparency, authenticity.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are things that have been
missing from
the Clinton campaign and from,
quite frankly

21:27.386 --> 21:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way that Hillary Clinton has
done her
job as secretary of state, and
then the Clinton

21:31.223 --> 21:33.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Global Initiative from the very
beginning.

21:33.859 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the expectations are very
different, and
they're not meeting those
expectations.

21:39.698 --> 21:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of these
themes just keep
on popping up again and again.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's exactly right.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think we're going to see
the end it
-- it's not.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, we
thank you.

21:48.307 --> 21:53.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

21:53.245 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:01.253 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what a judge's
ruling means for President
Obama's order on

22:06.058 --> 22:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transgender students; a jihadist
charged with
war crimes for destroying
ancient monuments;

22:13.265 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a Massachusetts couple's
plan to end hunger
and keep their son's memory
alive.

22:18.904 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Virtually every day,
the skies
over Northern Syria are filled
with Russian

22:24.843 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Assad regime jets, and,
often, the bombs
they drop land on civilians.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no 911 to dial, and no
one to call
for help.

22:33.719 --> 22:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people do come rushing to
save them, and
more often than not, the
rescuers are Syrians

22:38.757 --> 22:40.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wearing white helmets.

22:40.626 --> 22:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are ordinary men and women
who've chosen
to stay, pressed into service by
circumstance,

22:46.832 --> 22:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charged with saving their fellow
Syrians amid
a brutal war.

22:50.436 --> 22:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We meet some of them now, thanks
to special
correspondent Marcia Biggs, who
reports from

22:55.641 --> 22:57.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey.

22:57.443 --> 23:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: We all saw this
heartbreaking
video, 5-year-old Omran pulled
from under

23:03.716 --> 23:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rubble of his flattened
home, his photo
going viral.

23:07.386 --> 23:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stunned, bloodied, and caked
with dust, his
face a symbol of so many others.

23:13.759 --> 23:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the faces you didn't see in
this video
are of those who have been
pulling people

23:18.330 --> 23:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of the rubble for five long
years.

23:24.670 --> 23:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the call to work for the
brave members
of the Syrian Civil Defense, an
ad hoc grassroots

23:30.409 --> 23:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first-response unit within
rebel-held Syria.

23:33.512 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nicknamed the White Helmets,
they rush toward
the scene of a bombing to save
victims, many

23:39.618 --> 23:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of whom are trapped under
rubble, once tailors,
bakers, pharmacists, these 3,000
ordinary

23:46.592 --> 23:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian men and some women now
unwitting heroes.

23:50.329 --> 23:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-three-year-old Radi Saad
was a topography
student at Aleppo University
itching to get

23:56.302 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
out of Syria, when the
revolution began and
his life changed.

24:00.339 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now lives in Turkey, but
travels back and
forth to Syria to volunteer.

24:04.076 --> 24:08.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RADI SAAD, Rescue Worker
(through translator):
I never thought about being a
search-and-rescue

24:08.747 --> 24:09.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
worker.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That idea didn't exist in Syria.

24:11.417 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During shelling or after an
airstrike, all
the people come out to save
lives.

24:15.587 --> 24:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When someone in need comes to
you, would you
say, I have nothing to offer
you?

24:19.825 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So then why am I here?

24:21.593 --> 24:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a question I asked
myself.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was three years ago, and I
have been
working in civil defense ever
since.

24:27.666 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: They work under
the harshest
of conditions to claw through
the remains

24:33.172 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of buildings flattened by the
Syrian regime's
weapon of choice, the barrel
bomb, a crudely

24:38.911 --> 24:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made drum packed with explosives
and nails,
indiscriminately rolled out the
back of a

24:43.816 --> 24:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helicopter over civilian areas,
the slow and
silent descent a cruel harbinger
of the devastation

24:51.056 --> 24:53.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it creates.

24:53.926 --> 25:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RADI SAAD (through translator):
The hardest
part is to get people under the
rubble out.

25:03.602 --> 25:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's exhausting, and you don't
have technical
equipment to use.

25:07.473 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have simple equipment.

25:09.007 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, the process of searching
and rescuing
takes 30 or 40 continuous hours.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get tired, but the hope
inside you makes
you forget, and you just keep
going to try

25:18.584 --> 25:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reach the person who needs
your help.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Not all stories
have a happy
ending.

25:24.656 --> 25:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Radi remembers searching in vain
for 25 hours
for a 2-month-old child.

25:29.661 --> 25:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RADI SAAD (through translator):
His father
came to me, and I was the team
leader.

25:34.400 --> 25:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was begging me, not to
continue trying
to find his son.

25:38.370 --> 25:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, he just wanted me to find
any piece of
his son's body.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These were moments I would never
forget.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're not thinking.

25:46.678 --> 25:49.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're in a huge disaster, so
you don't think
about what's happening.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Your emotions go away.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't have them anymore.

25:52.518 --> 25:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I got home that night, I
remembered,
and I felt the same feeling I
have now.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was shocked.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we have any feeling left?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have we lost our feelings?

26:01.827 --> 26:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has the hope become about
finding a piece
of a loved one, a body part?

26:05.497 --> 26:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even now, I can't comprehend the
situation
I was in or what happened.

26:09.435 --> 26:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: But what makes it
one of the
most dangerous jobs in the
world, the infamous

26:17.576 --> 26:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
double tap, when planes circle
back after
the original strike to target
rescue workers

26:23.882 --> 26:29.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
racing to the scene.

26:29.688 --> 26:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last October, White Helmets were
responding
to this bombing in Idlib
province when Russian

26:34.693 --> 26:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jets circled back, killing
31-year-old Issam
al-Saleh (ph).

26:39.865 --> 26:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RADI SAAD (through translator):
I heard that
Russian airstrikes targeted a
farm with women

26:45.871 --> 26:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and children, so I jumped in the
car and went.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I couldn't drive fast enough.

26:50.676 --> 26:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I arrived, no one was
there, just people
under the rubble, but the jets
were coming

26:55.180 --> 26:56.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I heard that Issam had
died, it was a
big shock.

26:59.418 --> 27:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When we buried him, we all
started crying.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Issam was like a brother to me.

27:05.023 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Issam's cousin,
Raed Al Saleh,
is the head of Syrian Civil
Defense, like

27:10.062 --> 27:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most White Helmets, thrust into
a job he never
dreamed he'd have.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAED AL SALEH, Director, Syrian
Civil Defense
(through translator): Actually,
my work in

27:16.668 --> 27:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civil defense just kind of
happened.

27:18.904 --> 27:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that time, none of us in
Syria knew anything
about civil defense, or how this
work is done.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we went to a training in
Istanbul.

27:26.745 --> 27:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A trainer put us in a dark room
and asked
what we were able to find.

27:31.917 --> 27:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We said there was just debris,
but then he
turned on the light and we
realized there

27:36.321 --> 27:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were people pretending to be
wounded.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It shocked us that we hadn't
found them.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We decided then and there that
we had to be
serious about our training.

27:45.464 --> 27:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your mother or mine, your sister
or brother,
your friend could be under the
rubble, and

27:51.370 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they are not found, they will
die.

27:53.805 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Over the last five
years, they
say they have learned, saving
almost 60,000

28:00.312 --> 28:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives, working throughout all
parts of one
of the most fractured areas on
Earth.

28:06.218 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even some of the most radical
groups allow
them into their territory.

28:09.354 --> 28:13.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): To serve
the civilians in the regions
under control

28:13.258 --> 28:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of armed groups, we have no
choice but to
deal with such groups in order
to do our work.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This happens all over Syria.

28:21.667 --> 28:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We make it clear to all that we
don't make
any official links with any
political or military

28:27.005 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a group in Syria.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you have any
agreement with
ISIS to be able to work in those
areas?

28:31.643 --> 28:35.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): We go
and say we will offer our
services.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If you allow us to do so, fine.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If you don't, off we go.

28:39.251 --> 28:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Has any other
group this large
been able to unify in rebel-held
Syria?

28:43.422 --> 28:47.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): All over
Syria, there is no other
organization that

28:47.893 --> 28:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offers these services and works
under one
management, other than the
Syrian Civil Defense.

28:52.798 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Their tenacious
leader has gone
all over the world, begging for
an end to

28:57.803 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the violence, last year, an
impassioned speech
at the United Nations, this year
nominated

29:03.141 --> 29:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the Nobel Peace Prize, all
to no avail.

29:06.478 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): In all
my speeches, I was delivering a
message to

29:11.750 --> 29:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people, to be in solidarity
with us.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wasn't asking politicians to
do that.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Politicians aren't concerned
about human suffering.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't look at the problem
and get involved
to solve it.

29:23.328 --> 29:26.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They see the problems as
opportunities, to
see what they can get out of
them.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Is anyone
listening to you?

29:28.734 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): We hope
there are people listening to
us.

29:32.170 --> 29:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hope the people will stand by
us, to pressure
politicians to change their
policies, which

29:37.075 --> 29:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only benefit politicians, and
instead to base
those policies on human rights
and to take

29:42.848 --> 29:46.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into account the crimes
committed against
civilians all over the world.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you feel like
you're banging
your head against a wall?

29:48.920 --> 29:52.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): Actually,
I used to feel like I was
hitting my head

29:52.924 --> 29:54.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against a wall.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I feel like I'm hitting my
head against
iron.

29:56.294 --> 30:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, how do you
keep going when
no one is listening?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): We have
to.

30:03.368 --> 30:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What keeps us going are the
people we save
from the rubble.

30:07.239 --> 30:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People in Syria see us as the
hope that keeps
them alive.

30:10.308 --> 30:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: One of their most
hopeful moments
came in the summer of 2014;
29-year-old Khaled

30:16.148 --> 30:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Omar Harrah had already been
digging through
the rubble for nine hours when
he heard the

30:21.553 --> 30:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
faint sounds of a baby crying.

30:24.756 --> 30:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only two weeks old, baby Mahmud
was trapped
under three stories of a
collapsed building.

30:30.228 --> 30:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For several more hours, they
gingerly dug,
finally pulling him out alive.

30:36.635 --> 30:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khaled's video went viral, and
he was nicknamed
the baby savior.

30:43.775 --> 30:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in Syria, cruelty lies
around every corner.

30:48.413 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just over a week ago, Khaled was
killed in

Khaled's unit was based in
rebel-held Aleppo,
which has been besieged for over
a month by

31:03.628 --> 31:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government forces, which allow
no food or
medical aid to the over 300,000
civilians

31:09.401 --> 31:11.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trapped inside.

31:11.203 --> 31:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the Aleppo unit
recently sent
to the United Nations Security
Council this

31:15.474 --> 31:17.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Throughout the message, a battle
rages in
the background.

31:19.778 --> 31:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
broke our hearts
is that we heard nothing from
the U.N.

31:30.288 --> 31:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Abdul Rahman, a
30-year-old
volunteer from Aleppo, says the
food shortage

31:34.426 --> 31:39.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a main concern and half of
the men in the
unit are trying to learn to
farm.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they worried that they might
starve?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they worried that they're
going to run
out of food?

31:43.535 --> 31:48.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL RAHMAN, Rescue Worker: Of
course, but
they're still working, because
we believe

31:48.240 --> 31:49.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our job.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They lost the hope.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the bigger problem.

31:51.943 --> 31:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in Aleppo city, all the
world see the
besieged.

31:56.681 --> 32:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all the world just watching
what happened,
and no one do anything.

32:00.485 --> 32:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Despite all the
deaths and the
failures of the international
community, the

32:05.724 --> 32:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White Helmets soldier on.

32:07.659 --> 32:14.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAED AL SALEH (through
translator): It's difficult
to talk with our team everyday,
and most of

32:14.332 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the time, we have no answers to
all the questions
they ask.

32:17.602 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are doing an important
humanitarian job,
and we will be rewarded by God.

32:23.608 --> 32:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Koran says, in the name of
God, the most
gracious, the most merciful,
whosoever saveth

32:29.514 --> 32:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the life of one, it shall be as
if he had
saved the life of all mankind.

32:34.252 --> 32:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you save a human who was
under the rubble,
it's like you saved all mankind.

32:38.456 --> 32:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you feel proud when you wear
that?

32:43.762 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Radi, his uniform a symbol
of pride, and
for the young man who dreamed of
one day getting

32:48.967 --> 32:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of Syria, a renewed pride in
his country,
which he and the others hope to
someday rebuild.

32:55.173 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RADI SAAD (through translator):
Before the
revolution, we didn't have a
sense of belonging

33:00.245 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this country at all.

33:01.947 --> 33:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now we feel that, if we
don't build this
country, no one will.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: A small glimmer of
hope for
the future.

33:09.921 --> 33:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, every airstrike brings
more devastation,
and the men, like this one,
Fares Mohammed

33:16.428 --> 33:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali, who dig with their hands
and their hearts
to raise people out of the ruins
and into

33:22.100 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the light.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One can only wonder how long
this light of
hope can burn.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fares died last month after an
airstrike.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The decision by a
Texas judge
to block the Obama
administration's rules

33:51.496 --> 33:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on transgender bathrooms and
locker rooms
comes just as the school year is
starting.

33:57.469 --> 34:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's coming as many school
districts are
trying to determine what to do
now.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our update.

34:04.175 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This ruling is
the second
setback in recent weeks for
transgender advocates.

34:08.480 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, the Supreme
Court said
a Virginia school board could
block a transgender

34:12.951 --> 34:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student from using the boys
bathroom while
the higher court decides if it
will take up

34:17.055 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these broader case.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday's decision is the
first to say that
the Obama administration's
directive could

34:22.260 --> 34:24.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be blocked nationwide.

34:24.195 --> 34:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those directives instructed
school districts
to allow trans students to use
the bathroom

34:28.199 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their choice.

34:29.801 --> 34:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas is one of 13 states
challenging the
constitutionality of the
directive.

34:33.838 --> 34:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, the judge wrote
that the administration
had exceeded its authority under
Title IX,

34:38.910 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1970s-era law banning sex
discrimination
in schools.

34:42.247 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us wade through the
meaning of all
this, I'm joined now by Evie
Blad, who is

34:46.318 --> 34:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Education Week reporter
who's been covering
this story.

34:49.120 --> 34:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Evie, what does this ruling
say, and how
significant is this?

34:53.158 --> 34:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD, Education Week: It's
very significant,
in that it's the first time we
have heard

34:57.128 --> 35:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a federal court weigh in on a
nationwide basis.

35:00.699 --> 35:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are several cases winding
their way
through the federal courts now,
but the only

35:06.705 --> 35:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one that has had a ruling so far
applied only
in one circuit.

35:11.876 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's significant, in that
the school year
is about to start, and this
judge is saying,

35:17.349 --> 35:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nationwide, that the Obama
administration's
regulations under Title IX, its
civil rights

35:22.921 --> 35:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guidance, doesn't need to be
implemented.

35:25.757 --> 35:31.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what that means is if a
school doesn't
want to create a policy allowing
transgender

35:31.429 --> 35:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students to use the rest room of
their choice,
it doesn't have to.

35:34.165 --> 35:40.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if a school has a policy
that it wants
to have, it can keep that
policy.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just doesn't have a federal
directive to
do so.

35:42.507 --> 35:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Texas was
one of a bunch
of states that had objection to
these rules.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the essence of their
objection?

35:48.813 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Well, there are two
primary things
that you will see in these
lawsuits.

35:53.952 --> 35:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is something that we're all
familiar with,
which is the argument that folks
are making

35:57.489 --> 35:59.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about privacy rights of
students.

35:59.791 --> 36:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does my student or my child who
isn't transgender
have a right to use a restroom
that doesn't

36:08.166 --> 36:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have transgender students in it?

36:09.567 --> 36:11.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVIE BLAD: There is some
discomfort because
some students who have undergone
gender transitions

36:14.439 --> 36:16.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
haven't undergone sex
transitions.

36:16.207 --> 36:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there's some discomfort
there.

36:18.376 --> 36:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the primary argument is one
of legal interpretation.

36:21.913 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, when the Obama
administration
created the civil rights
guidance, did it

36:28.386 --> 36:33.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
interpret an existing
regulation, which is
what it argues it did, or, what
the states

36:33.625 --> 36:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argue that it did is that it
created a new
one under the guise of
interpreting law.

36:39.164 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it was to create a new
policy, the
states argue that it should have
gone through

36:44.669 --> 36:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Administrative Procedures
Act, and given
them time to comment and weigh
in on the issue.

36:50.308 --> 36:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, that's
what the judge
said in this case, that the way
the Obama

36:54.479 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration went about
issuing the directive
was what was illegal, in its
view?

36:58.983 --> 37:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Yes, he said that the
states had
proven that there's merit to
this case, so

37:03.655 --> 37:04.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's worth hearing.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is a temporary delay.

37:06.591 --> 37:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what he's doing is, he's
halting the directive
until he has a chance to hear
and weigh in

37:12.097 --> 37:13.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the full case.

37:13.932 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, he said his order was
pretty clear
that they may have violated the
Administrative

37:23.274 --> 37:25.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Procedures Act.

37:25.143 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So that's the
judge's ruling,
but as we have seen with a lot
of these laws

37:28.446 --> 37:33.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the country, some of the
resistance
to them comes from the belief
that somehow

37:33.918 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if these laws are passed, that
men, not transgender
men, are going to somehow dress
up as women

37:39.791 --> 37:43.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and go into the women's
restrooms.

37:43.061 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any evidence that that
kind of activity
actually goes on?

37:46.798 --> 37:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVIE BLAD: Right.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, and the argument at the
school level
is oftentimes that boys will
decide one day

37:52.770 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be one thing and another
thing, that there
will be some mischievousness,
right?

37:56.407 --> 38:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, long before the federal
regulations
came out, or long before the
Obama administration

38:02.313 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began asserting these things in
courts, school
districts were making these
decisions on their

38:08.753 --> 38:09.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, L.A. Unified, for example,
the second...

38:11.322 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Los Angeles.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Yes, the second
largest district
in the country, for more than a
decade, has

38:15.760 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a policy that allowed
transgender students
to use the restroom that aligned
with their

38:20.098 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gender identity.

38:21.900 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
L.A. Unified says that they can
count on one
hand the numbers of times a
student has had

38:28.039 --> 38:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to clarify these accommodations
in administrative
offices.

38:33.144 --> 38:39.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they don't have any
documented incidents
of problems, the last time I
checked.

38:39.083 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the problem here is that
we are talking
to districts who are oftentimes
defending

38:42.654 --> 38:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policies they feel very strongly
about.

38:45.456 --> 38:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some opponents of these policies
may say,
even if there aren't these big
documented

38:49.994 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems, that they still feel
that their
students have some privacy
interests here

38:54.299 --> 38:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that need to be respected.

38:56.067 --> 39:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if I'm a
transgender
student and I start school
tomorrow, next

39:00.238 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, two weeks from now, what
does this ruling
mean for me?

39:03.708 --> 39:05.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVIE BLAD: Right.

39:05.476 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if your school doesn't
have a policy
that directs what restroom
you're allowed

39:12.317 --> 39:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use, you don't have the
ability to take
enforcement through the
Department of Education,

39:20.925 --> 39:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the judge has said you
can't enforce
this directive.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Previously, a transgender
student could go
to the department and say: I
feel like my

39:28.700 --> 39:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
civil rights are being violated.

39:30.802 --> 39:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, that has been put on
hold through
this order.

39:34.939 --> 39:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Transgender students say that
bathrooms are
not their only concern in
school, sort of

39:39.711 --> 39:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feeling safe and a sense of
belonging, but
they say that they do matter,
because when

39:43.648 --> 39:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a school doesn't allow them to
use the restroom
of their choice or requires them
to use a

39:47.919 --> 39:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
single stall or staff restroom,
they say that
it feels like the school isn't
respecting

39:52.423 --> 39:54.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their gender transition.

39:54.292 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that can stigmatize them or
bring other
school climate concerns with
their classmates.

39:58.062 --> 40:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, there's a
lot of different
legal cases going on, in Texas,
and Virginia

40:02.800 --> 40:04.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other places.

40:04.569 --> 40:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is your sense, is the legal
analysis here
that this is ultimately going to
end up at

40:09.040 --> 40:10.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Supreme Court?

40:10.842 --> 40:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: There's a lot of
folks in school
law who felt that it was bound
for that for

40:14.178 --> 40:16.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a long time.

40:16.047 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a decision in Virginia
that the school
court -- the Supreme Court has
put a temporary

40:20.818 --> 40:24.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hold on that case.

40:24.088 --> 40:28.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that instance, the court of
appeals sided
with the Obama administration on
these rules

40:28.393 --> 40:31.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and said that it is an
appropriate interpretation
of Title IX.

40:32.030 --> 40:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Supreme Court put a
temporary halt
on that while it decides whether
it is going

40:36.968 --> 40:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to consider the issue in its
next term.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In that case, we could get an
ultimate decision.

40:41.806 --> 40:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if the Supreme Court
decides not to take
up that case, we could see
differing issues

40:46.177 --> 40:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- differing opinions on the
circuit court
level.

40:48.980 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in that case, a lot of
times, those issues
end up going to the Supreme
Court for further

40:53.217 --> 40:54.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clarity.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, chances are, it might end up
there sooner
or later.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Evie Blad of
Education Week, thank you very
much.

41:00.992 --> 41:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVIE BLAD: Thank you.

41:08.366 --> 41:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a first for
the International
Criminal Court at The Hague, a
trial dealing

41:16.474 --> 41:19.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the destruction of cultural
heritage..

41:19.477 --> 41:24.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's over the deliberate
wrecking in 2012
of historic earthen buildings
and religious

41:24.382 --> 41:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shrines in the West African
nation of Mali.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

41:29.754 --> 41:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our ongoing series
Culture at
Risk.

41:33.658 --> 41:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sixty holy tombs
dating back
to the 14th century, all reduced
to rubble

41:40.298 --> 41:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a wave of violence unleashed
on Timbuktu
by Islamist militants four years
ago.

41:46.170 --> 41:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, one of those responsible
stood in front
of the International Criminal
Court and admitted

41:51.509 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his guilt.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AHMAD AL FAQI AL MAHDI,
Defendant (through
translator): I regret all the
damage that

41:55.680 --> 41:57.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my actions have caused.

41:57.448 --> 42:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I regret what I have caused to
my family,
my community in Timbuktu, what I
have caused

42:01.753 --> 42:03.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my home nation, Mali.

42:03.588 --> 42:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Prosecutors say
Ahmad Al Faqi
Al Mahdi directed the
destruction of nine

42:08.426 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mausoleums and damage to a
mosque.

42:11.295 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd been recruited to lead a
vice squad by
a group of Islamist rebels,
affiliated with

42:16.334 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-Qaida, who seized control of
Northern Mali
in 2012.

42:19.871 --> 42:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMAD AL FAQI AL MAHDI (through
translator):
I was influenced by a group of
deviant people

42:24.442 --> 42:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from al-Qaida, and they were
able to influence
me, to carry me in their evil
wave, through

42:29.180 --> 42:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions that affected the whole
population.

42:31.282 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The rebels were
eventually
driven out by French troops in
2013.

42:36.053 --> 42:42.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The heaps of rubble they left
behind have
since mostly been rebuilt with
help from UNESCO.

42:42.660 --> 42:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent years, cultural relics
across Northern
Africa and the Mideast have been
targeted

42:47.598 --> 42:53.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by militant groups, most
dramatically by the
Islamic State at sites including
the ancient

42:53.337 --> 42:57.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cities of Palmyra, Syria, and
Nimrud in Iraq.

42:57.642 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unlike Mali, those countries are
not subject
to the jurisdiction of the ICC.

43:01.746 --> 43:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mahdi, who, in the plea bargain
faces 11 years
in prison, today called for an
end to such

43:08.553 --> 43:10.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
acts.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMAD AL FAQI AL MAHDI (through
translator):
I would like to give a piece of
advice to

43:12.723 --> 43:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims all over the world, not
to get involved
in the same acts I got involved
in, because

43:17.795 --> 43:20.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are not going to lead to
any good to
humanity.

43:20.331 --> 43:24.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Human rights
groups say Mahdi
and others also committed crimes
against the

43:24.402 --> 43:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local community, including rape
and sexual
slavery.

43:28.306 --> 43:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ICC says further charges may
follow.

43:32.376 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for more on this case and
its broader
implications, we're joined by
Patty Gerstenblith.

43:36.681 --> 43:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a professor of law at
DePaul University
and head of its Center for Art,
Museum and

43:41.586 --> 43:43.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cultural Heritage Law.

43:43.254 --> 43:45.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

43:45.056 --> 43:49.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First thing I want to ask is,
how significant
is this case as a war crime
prosecution?

43:49.160 --> 43:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATTY GERSTENBLITH, DePaul
University: Yes,
it is very significant.

43:52.330 --> 43:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first case that we have
on an international
level where somebody was
prosecuted only for

43:58.870 --> 44:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the crime of destruction of
cultural heritage.

44:01.506 --> 44:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have other examples of
prosecutions during
the World War II and the Balkan
conflict,

44:06.611 --> 44:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in all those cases, the
defendants had
committed a variety of war
crimes and crimes

44:11.749 --> 44:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against humanity, things like
mass killings
of civilians, rapes, things like
that.

44:18.723 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is the first case we
have where the
defendant was charged only with
destruction

44:23.928 --> 44:25.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of cultural heritage.

44:25.730 --> 44:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe it's significant
because it
sends a message that the
international community

44:30.134 --> 44:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will take these kinds of crimes,
these kind
of destructions seriously.

44:33.938 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why has it taken
so long, or
why is it so hard to bring these
kind of cases?

44:39.877 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it the lack of the law or the
lack of the
will to bring these cases?

44:44.949 --> 44:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTY GERSTENBLITH: I would say
it's a variety.

44:47.818 --> 44:53.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The laws, until this point, have
been based
-- or the prosecutions have been
based on

44:53.724 --> 44:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special criminal tribunals that
were set up,
such as the Nuremberg tribunal
and the International

44:58.930 --> 45:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia
following the Balkan conflict.

45:03.034 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I said, in those cases,
there were
many, many things, horrible
things that were

45:07.672 --> 45:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done, of which cultural property
destruction
was just one.

45:11.375 --> 45:15.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, unfortunately, the
international community
didn't always regard the
cultural heritage

45:15.780 --> 45:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destruction as necessarily the
most significant
of the different kinds of crimes
that were

45:21.953 --> 45:23.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committed.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have the structure of the
International
Criminal Court established by
the Rome Statute.

45:27.858 --> 45:30.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where this particular
prosecution
was brought.

45:30.895 --> 45:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is always the problem that
different
countries have ratified
different international

45:35.766 --> 45:37.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conventions.

45:37.668 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you can only bring a
prosecution when
a country has ratified the
appropriate instrument.

45:42.239 --> 45:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this case, Mali is a member
of the International
Criminal Court.

45:47.011 --> 45:53.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has ratified the Rome
Statute, which made
this feasible under this
particular legislation.

45:53.217 --> 46:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This perhaps at this point was
brought as
a sole charge, sole crime,
because of what

46:01.158 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're witnessing going on,
particularly in
the Middle East, where we have
the Islamic

46:05.529 --> 46:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State carrying out large-scale
destruction
of cultural and religious sites.

46:11.135 --> 46:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has not been seen on this
kind of a level
with this much publicity in a
long time, and

46:16.841 --> 46:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly not things that we
have seen in
real time happening.

46:20.511 --> 46:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the world has stood by and
seen this happen.

46:23.914 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we have finally been
able to send
a message that these kinds of
destructions

46:29.387 --> 46:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be taken seriously by the
international
community.

46:31.922 --> 46:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, when you look
at this specific
Timbuktu case, though, can you
say why it

46:38.529 --> 46:39.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was successful?

46:39.530 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are there particulars there?

46:41.332 --> 46:46.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we use it to see how it
might look
to other cases, what happened
there?

46:46.671 --> 46:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY GERSTENBLITH: Well, I
think one of the
most important things that made
this case

46:49.940 --> 46:54.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feasible, first of all, the law
was in place,
as I mentioned, the
international law.

46:54.645 --> 47:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, it happened that Mr.
Al Mahdi was
apprehended in a different
country, but he

47:00.651 --> 47:03.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was then turned over to the
International
Criminal Court.

47:03.788 --> 47:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the most important
thing from
a straight factual or
evidentiary perspective

47:08.192 --> 47:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that there were films that
were made, videos
that were made of him destroying
and directing

47:14.198 --> 47:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the destruction, and, in fact,
bragging about
his role in destroying these
sites, because,

47:19.136 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remember that, in a lot of these
cases, it's
-- when a case is brought
sometimes years

47:23.274 --> 47:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after something has been done,
proving exactly
who did what becomes difficult.

47:28.412 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we can have documentation
that a site was
destroyed.

47:30.915 --> 47:35.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can say, oh, this clearly
violated international
law, but proving exactly who and
under what

47:35.886 --> 47:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances did it, proving
the intentionality,
and then proving the identity of
the person

47:41.625 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who carried it out.

47:43.427 --> 47:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, in the Balkan
cases, the
cases of destruction in Bosnia
and in Croatia,

47:49.200 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was often difficult to
determine exactly
who was responsible, who gave
the order, who

47:53.971 --> 47:55.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
carried it out.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And was it intentional?

47:57.408 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And also I guess another
important aspect
is that there was no armed
conflict going

48:01.579 --> 48:05.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on at the time that the shrines
in Timbuktu
were destroyed.

48:05.516 --> 48:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In most cases, destruction of
cultural heritage
can be excused to what's called
military necessity.

48:11.789 --> 48:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was an example in Timbuktu
where there
was clearly no military
necessity for carrying

48:18.362 --> 48:20.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out the destruction.

48:20.164 --> 48:23.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
mentioned -- and,
of course, we have reported on
these dramatic

48:23.167 --> 48:30.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases in Syria and Iraq and
elsewhere -- the
widespread scale of them now.

48:30.241 --> 48:35.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Can you see this case in
Timbuktu as a real
precedent that might have an
impact?

48:35.379 --> 48:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATTY GERSTENBLITH: I certainly
think it is
a precedent.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very good precedent.

48:40.751 --> 48:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it will have an impact
is always difficult
to tell, because, presumably,
the Islamic

48:46.390 --> 48:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State members who are carrying
out the most
egregious of the destruction,
maybe they're

48:50.594 --> 48:54.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not worried about whether some
day they will
be brought before a criminal
tribunal.

48:54.665 --> 48:58.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be difficult to tell
exactly who ordered
the destruction.

48:58.269 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that there is a
message that
other destructions, particularly
in Syria,

49:03.107 --> 49:09.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, being carried out
by the Assad
regime, perhaps accidentally,
perhaps intentionally,

49:09.079 --> 49:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps negligently or an
extreme form of
negligence.

49:13.684 --> 49:19.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I hope the message is going
not only to
the obvious examples of the
Islamic State,

49:20.024 --> 49:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also to other governments,
to other individuals
who also are carrying out or are
responsible

49:26.330 --> 49:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for this kind of heritage
destruction.

49:28.098 --> 49:30.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Patty
Gerstenblith, thank you
very much.

49:30.668 --> 49:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATTY GERSTENBLITH: Sure.

49:31.735 --> 49:37.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Jeff.

49:37.975 --> 49:48.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One Massachusetts
couple is
on a mission to end hunger in
their town of

49:48.052 --> 49:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Framingham about 20 miles
outside of Boston.

49:51.722 --> 49:57.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Tina Martin from PBS member
station WGBH
reports, their trailer full of
food is making

49:57.962 --> 50:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a difference in the lives of
low-income families.

50:01.265 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also helping keep their
son's memory
alive.

50:04.602 --> 50:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: One smile and one
plate of food
at a time is how David and
Alicia Blais of

50:12.276 --> 50:14.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Framingham plan to knock out
hunger in their
hometown.

50:14.812 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALICIA BLAIS, Daniel's Table:
Hi.

50:15.813 --> 50:17.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

50:17.348 --> 50:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS, Daniel's Table:
Over dinner one
night, I was talking to Alicia.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, what if we just
solved it?

50:20.751 --> 50:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would it look like if we
just solved
hunger in Framingham?

50:23.387 --> 50:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA BLAIS: You know yourself,
when you're
hungry, you don't study well,
you don't work

50:29.793 --> 50:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well, you don't think straight.

50:31.528 --> 50:35.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The Greater Boston
Food Bank
estimates about one in 12 people
in Eastern

50:35.566 --> 50:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Massachusetts get assistance
with food.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many are families with children.

50:40.304 --> 50:44.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That especially touched the
couple who started
Daniel's Table two years ago.

50:44.074 --> 50:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: My son Daniel died
at birth 21
years ago.

50:48.412 --> 50:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we started with this
project, we
thought that we would name it
after him.

50:53.083 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's kind of a motivating factor
for me.

50:55.619 --> 51:00.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Their food trailer
is designed
with a picture of Daniel as his
parents picture

51:00.124 --> 51:01.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

51:01.926 --> 51:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fill it up and hitch it to
their pick
up truck and head to different
neighborhoods

51:06.330 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in what's considered the largest
town in the
country.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This trailer can serve about 200
to 300 people?

51:10.768 --> 51:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: Right, just about
200 to 300.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: And how many times
are you going
out a week?

51:15.940 --> 51:18.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: We go out three
nights a week
with the trailer, and then we do
something

51:18.409 --> 51:20.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Salvation Army on
Saturdays.

51:20.878 --> 51:26.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: We met them in
Freddie Franjul's
neighborhood, where seeing the
truck is a

51:26.617 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
huge relief.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDDIE FRANJUL, Father:
Actually, it's a
big deal for pretty much family
around here,

51:30.854 --> 51:32.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because everyone is on low
incomes.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Franjul is a single
dad raising
three girls.

51:35.726 --> 51:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDDIE FRANJUL: Well, like,
tonight, we didn't
have to spend money on dinner.

51:39.997 --> 51:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we take advantage of this
opportunity
over here.

51:43.067 --> 51:47.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: If we can cover a
couple of meals
a week for them, then they're
able to manage

51:47.805 --> 51:49.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their budget.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: That's the idea,
especially when
school is out.

51:51.742 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These hot dogs and hamburgers
often replace
meals children would otherwise
receive through

51:56.613 --> 51:58.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
free lunch programs.

51:58.549 --> 52:02.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: Summer is probably
the most challenging
time for some of these kids,
because their

52:02.252 --> 52:05.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parents are now going to have to
feed them
three times a day, instead of
just once.

52:05.422 --> 52:09.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: David and Alicia
feed close to
1,000 a week for free.

52:10.027 --> 52:13.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Expenses like food, equipment,
and gas for
the truck add up.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have some donors and
something else.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BLAIS: We pray a lot.

52:20.704 --> 52:26.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's probably our -- we probably
get our strongest
response when we do that.

52:26.744 --> 52:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: And prayer works.

52:28.245 --> 52:33.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just bought a bigger
trailer that can
feed about 3,000 people a day.

52:33.584 --> 52:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alicia thinks they have an angel
watching
over them, the son who is always
with them

52:38.422 --> 52:40.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in spirit.

52:40.057 --> 52:41.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA BLAIS: I think he looks
down on and
probably helps make it all
happen.

52:41.825 --> 52:50.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: For the "PBS
