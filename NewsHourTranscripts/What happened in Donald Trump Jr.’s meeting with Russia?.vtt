JUDY WOODRUFF: The week is
ending the way it began,
with new disclosures
about the president's

00:04.833 --> 00:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
son and his meeting
with a Russian lawyer.

00:07.766 --> 00:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turns out at least one
more person was at that
session than previously known.

00:12.733 --> 00:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

00:14.733 --> 00:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
returned from his quick Paris
trip to face new questions about

00:21.966 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether his campaign
sought damaging information
on Hillary Clinton from
the Russian government.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Among the uncertainties?

00:28.366 --> 00:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many people were at the June
2016 meeting at Trump Tower?

00:32.366 --> 00:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, a new name emerged,
Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born
Washington lobbyist and Soviet

00:38.833 --> 00:40.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
army veteran.

00:40.966 --> 00:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met with Donald Trump Jr.,
Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner,
campaign chairman Paul Manafort,

00:47.200 --> 00:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russian lawyer Natalia
Veselnitskaya, music
promoter Rob Goldstone,
an acquaintance of

00:52.033 --> 00:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the younger Trump who
helped set up the session,
and an interpreter.

00:56.566 --> 00:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. had not
disclosed the additional people.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY, Host, "Hannity":
So, as far as you know, as far
as this incident is concerned,

01:01.866 --> 01:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is all of it?

01:03.300 --> 01:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: This is everything.

01:04.100 --> 01:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is everything.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's also not
clear just when President
Trump was told of the meeting.

01:09.766 --> 01:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This week, he told Reuters
that he had only learned of it
just two or three days before

01:14.366 --> 01:16.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:16.333 --> 01:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But aboard Air Force One on
his way to Paris, the told
reporters, in fact, maybe it was

01:20.133 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mentioned at some point.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner has revised his security
clearance disclosure form
at least three times to add

01:28.366 --> 01:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as many of 100 more
foreign contacts.

01:31.900 --> 01:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's drawing the ire
of Democrats like House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: I also called
for the revoking of the security

01:39.733 --> 01:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clearance of Jared Kushner.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's absolutely ridiculous that
he should have that clearance.

01:46.933 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And Mr. Trump is
adding to his legal team.

01:51.133 --> 01:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington attorney Ty Cobb
becomes special counsel to
the president and will oversee

01:56.000 --> 02:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the legal and media response
to the Russia investigation.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

02:02.866 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more, we're
now joined by Julie Pace.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the Washington bureau
chief for the Associated Press,
and she took part in a phone

02:11.200 --> 02:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation with Rinat
Akhmetshin earlier today.

02:15.066 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie, thank you very
much for talking with us.

02:17.433 --> 02:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Julie, what is known
about Rinat Akhmetshin?

02:20.566 --> 02:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE, Associated Press:
Well, Rinat is a person who
is actually fairly well-known

02:26.233 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Washington.

02:28.333 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a lobbyist who has worked
on issues with ties to Russia,
a bit of a character, a bit

02:35.266 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a fixer on these
types of issues, not this
sort of backroom, shady
character who doesn't

02:41.266 --> 02:43.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a profile.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you work in these circles
in Washington, he's probably
someone that you have run in

02:45.800 --> 02:46.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been on
Capitol Hill before.

02:48.966 --> 02:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, despite that, it is
certainly unique that he would
end up in a conference room

02:54.733 --> 02:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Trump Tower in the middle
of a presidential campaign.

02:58.033 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I heard the word
fixer associated with his name.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is his name
surfacing only now?

03:05.133 --> 03:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We learned about this
meeting days ago.

03:07.066 --> 03:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE PACE: That is the perfect
question on this, why now?

03:10.766 --> 03:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why is it that we have
had so many different
explanations about the
purpose of this meeting

03:15.333 --> 03:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the participants
of this meeting?

03:18.366 --> 03:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's kind of baffling if
you're thinking about this
from a political strategy.

03:23.033 --> 03:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is sort of politics 101,
that if you are in a crisis, if
there is something controversial

03:27.766 --> 03:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's happened, it's best to
get all of the information out.

03:30.966 --> 03:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take the hit in one lump, as
opposed to dripping that out,
in this case, over the course of

03:35.833 --> 03:38.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a week.

03:38.366 --> 03:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there has been no
explanation as to why
we're just finding out
that he was a participant,

03:41.166 --> 03:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other than the fact that he
was willing to get on the phone
with us today and disclose

03:44.766 --> 03:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this information and talk
to us at some length.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it
sounds like now he is
talking to the press.

03:51.766 --> 03:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there anything more to be
learned about this meeting
than what's already said?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE PACE: I think there is.

03:57.100 --> 04:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big thing that all of
the participants have said is
that in the end, nothing came

04:02.600 --> 04:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of this meeting.

04:04.633 --> 04:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that Rinat
told us today, though, is that
the Russian lawyer who was

04:07.466 --> 04:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the meeting actually showed
up with some documents in hand,
and they were in a plastic

04:11.633 --> 04:13.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
folder.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He professed to not know the
content of those documents.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that that's one
question that we need to answer.

04:17.933 --> 04:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were those documents, who
were they specifically given to,
who took them out of the room?

04:21.766 --> 04:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, more broadly, I
think that it's worth
pressing participants
in this meeting about

04:27.933 --> 04:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether anything did
come out of this.

04:30.433 --> 04:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the fact that
the explanations have
changed so much, I really
don't think we should

04:33.500 --> 04:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be taking explanations on
face value at this point.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Julie,
there's also this question now
-- and we heard it mentioned

04:39.133 --> 04:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the report -- when
President Trump himself
learned about the meeting.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, it was that he had
just learned about it a few
days ago, but then I guess

04:48.266 --> 04:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said something different
in that conversation
with reporters.

04:51.866 --> 04:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE: I think this is --
again, timelines keep shifting
when it comes to this meeting.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president initially
said is that he only knew about
it two or three days before.

05:04.833 --> 05:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the reasons why there are
so many questions about this,
though, is that Jared Kushner

05:10.666 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and his advisers said
that this is something
that they discovered
and put on a disclosure

05:14.800 --> 05:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
form a few weeks ago.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this was known to people
in the White House prior to
this past weekend, when the

05:20.766 --> 05:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporting started to come out.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And given the closeness of the
president to his family, and
given the fact that the Russian

05:26.633 --> 05:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
investigations and every
little detail about
these investigations
is so critical right

05:33.600 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, it is hard to imagine that
this is something that would
be kept from the president for

05:37.366 --> 05:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so long.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
finally, Julie, you
mentioned Jared Kushner.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been a number of
stories this week about turmoil,
ongoing turmoil inside the

05:47.133 --> 05:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House, fingers pointing
in different directions, and
some of the White House staffing

05:52.200 --> 05:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being upset with Jared Kushner.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that about?

05:55.033 --> 05:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE: Well, this has
become a bit of pattern
for this White House.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When something goes
wrong, you start having
people turn on each other.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The finger-pointing
gets pretty intense.

06:01.733 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in this case, you have a
situation where you have someone
like Jared Kushner, who is

06:06.366 --> 06:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a senior adviser to the
president, but operates
in pretty rarefied
territory because he's

06:10.933 --> 06:12.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also family.

06:12.933 --> 06:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the one person whose
name has come up in relation to
the Russia investigations who

06:17.733 --> 06:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is currently sitting
in the West Wing.

06:20.866 --> 06:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for some of the folks who
are in there right now, the fact
that he is in that situation

06:25.600 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and still remains a
protected adviser, it's
pretty irritating to them.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they worry about their
interactions with him.

06:34.366 --> 06:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever you have a special
counsel investigation
that revolves around
the White House, you

06:36.800 --> 06:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have staffers that have
to get lawyers, staffers
that are pretty --
staffers that are fairly

06:41.233 --> 06:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well-paid having to get
pretty expensive lawyers.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIE PACE: This is not
a comfortable situation
for anybody in there.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jared Kushner, given his
relationship and his position
in the West Wing, is taking

06:51.566 --> 06:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of the heat internally.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime,
we have seen some
Democrats on Capitol
Hill, some of them saying

06:56.400 --> 07:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he should step down, others
saying he should have his
security clearance taken away.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie Pace with the Associated
Press, we thank you.

07:03.233 --> 07:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE PACE: Thank you, Judy.
