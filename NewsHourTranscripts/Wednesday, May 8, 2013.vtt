VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GIVING A GROUP

46:28.175 --> 46:30.754
VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GIVING A GROUP
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS A CALCULATOR

46:30.756 --> 46:32.475
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GIVING A GROUP
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS A CALCULATOR
AND SAYING, OKAY, KIDS, ADD UP

46:32.477 --> 46:33.833
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS A CALCULATOR
AND SAYING, OKAY, KIDS, ADD UP
THESE NUMBERS AS QUICKLY AS

46:33.835 --> 46:35.058
AND SAYING, OKAY, KIDS, ADD UP
THESE NUMBERS AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE AND MAKE UP WHATEVER

46:35.060 --> 46:35.786
THESE NUMBERS AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE AND MAKE UP WHATEVER
NUMBERS YOU WANT.

46:35.788 --> 46:37.938
POSSIBLE AND MAKE UP WHATEVER
NUMBERS YOU WANT.
ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE

46:37.940 --> 46:38.268
NUMBERS YOU WANT.
ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE
MADNESS.

46:38.270 --> 46:39.890
ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE
MADNESS.
JUST A KIND OF CHAOS OF NUMBERS

46:39.892 --> 46:40.883
MADNESS.
JUST A KIND OF CHAOS OF NUMBERS
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU

46:40.885 --> 46:44.260
JUST A KIND OF CHAOS OF NUMBERS
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THEM EITHER DIRECTLY OR

46:44.262 --> 46:45.021
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THEM EITHER DIRECTLY OR
INCOMPARISON TO EACH OTHER.

46:45.023 --> 46:46.742
LOOK AT THEM EITHER DIRECTLY OR
INCOMPARISON TO EACH OTHER.
SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE

46:46.744 --> 46:48.464
INCOMPARISON TO EACH OTHER.
SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE
METHOD TO THIS MADNESS?

46:48.466 --> 46:51.013
SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE
METHOD TO THIS MADNESS?
ARE THESE NUMBERS DRIVING UP

46:51.015 --> 46:51.609
METHOD TO THIS MADNESS?
ARE THESE NUMBERS DRIVING UP
HOSPITAL COSTS?

46:51.611 --> 46:53.926
ARE THESE NUMBERS DRIVING UP
HOSPITAL COSTS?
ARE THEY COSTING US MORE AS

46:53.928 --> 46:56.276

ARE THEY COSTING US MORE AS
PRIVATE PAYORS, AS GOVERNMENT

46:56.278 --> 46:56.608
ARE THEY COSTING US MORE AS
PRIVATE PAYORS, AS GOVERNMENT
PAYORS?

46:56.610 --> 46:59.951
PRIVATE PAYORS, AS GOVERNMENT
PAYORS?
AND ONE HAS TO THINK THAT HIGHER

46:59.953 --> 47:02.267
PAYORS?
AND ONE HAS TO THINK THAT HIGHER
STICKER PRICES INVARIABLY DO

47:02.269 --> 47:03.889
AND ONE HAS TO THINK THAT HIGHER
STICKER PRICES INVARIABLY DO
LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS SO THE

47:03.891 --> 47:06.869
STICKER PRICES INVARIABLY DO
LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS SO THE
QUESTION NOW BECOMES WHAT IS THE

47:06.871 --> 47:08.260
LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS SO THE
QUESTION NOW BECOMES WHAT IS THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE CHARGES

47:08.262 --> 47:10.576
QUESTION NOW BECOMES WHAT IS THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE CHARGES
AND THE PRICES WE ACTUALLY DO

47:10.578 --> 47:11.039
CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE CHARGES
AND THE PRICES WE ACTUALLY DO
PAY?

47:11.041 --> 47:12.497
