GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:06.173 --> 00:11.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff here
in Iowa for our special coverage
of tonight's

00:11.345 --> 00:13.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential caucuses.

00:13.313 --> 00:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be looking at the role
of evangelicals
in shaking out this crowded
Republican field.

00:17.951 --> 00:22.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR KENNEY LINHART, The
Cathedral: You
want to see things change in
Iowa? Do you

00:22.823 --> 00:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to see the glory of God
come down to
Iowa? Then you need to be
involved in the

00:26.660 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political process.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we talk with Amy
Walter and
Tamara Keith about what's
happening on the

00:30.297 --> 00:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground as candidates make their
final push.

00:33.667 --> 00:38.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, David Brooks and Michelle
Cottle are
here to analyze the race.

00:38.839 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.646 --> 00:48.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:48.482 --> 00:57.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's finally here,
caucus night
in Iowa.

00:57.257 --> 01:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People will gather at sites all
over the state
to cast the first actual votes
of the 2016

01:02.796 --> 01:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential election year. It
comes after
endless months of campaigning
and more than

01:06.967 --> 01:14.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$200 million spent on ads. The
potential payoff?
Forty-four delegates for
Democrats, 30 for

01:14.775 --> 01:16.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans, and bragging
rights.

01:16.610 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy and the "NewsHour" team are
on the ground
in the Hawkeye State tonight --
Judy.

01:20.781 --> 01:27.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Gwen, the
candidates we're
watching on this final day are
also chasing

01:27.254 --> 01:34.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another precious commodity,
momentum. And
so the focus in these final
hours for them

01:34.261 --> 01:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is on making sure anybody who is
leaning or
committed shows up when and
where they're

01:40.167 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needed.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Thank you so much. Thanks for
all your help.

01:44.071 --> 01:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most candidates
were on the
ground here in Iowa one last
time today, making

01:50.243 --> 01:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one last pitch to voters who may
not have
made up their minds, and urging
those already

01:56.350 --> 02:00.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on their side to turn out
tonight.

02:00.187 --> 02:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders is
facing the question, will his
supporters,

02:05.258 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many of them first-timers to the
caucuses,
show up? He revved up volunteers
in Des Moines

02:11.398 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
So what is our job today? It's
to make sure

02:15.335 --> 02:20.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have the highest voter
turnout possible.
That happens, we win. Let's go
get them. Thank

02:21.041 --> 02:21.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you all.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:23.910 --> 02:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
was also in
Des Moines. With pastries in
hand, she cheered

02:28.815 --> 02:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her volunteers through their
last-minute push.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Thank you. We will do it
together.

02:34.521 --> 02:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In late polls,
Clinton has
a small advantage. But with
Sanders well ahead

02:38.992 --> 02:43.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in next week's New Hampshire
primary, Clinton's
feeling the pressure here.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Come
caucus for me
tonight. OK?

02:45.532 --> 02:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Republican
side, Donald
Trump is also relying on
first-time caucus-goers

02:50.737 --> 02:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for support. He made his plea
today in Waterloo
in Northeastern Iowa.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We are leading all the polls and
we're leading

02:57.844 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iowa, but it doesn't mean
anything. You
have got to go out tonight and
caucus. Hopefully,

03:01.681 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, we're going to have the
beginning
of what is going to be in a
certain way a

03:05.919 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very positive revolution.

03:07.721 --> 03:11.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump has opened
up a lead
in recent polls on his closest
rival, Ted

03:11.892 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz. But the Texas senator is
hoping his
campaign's organization and
outreach to evangelicals

03:18.765 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will work in his favor.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We have now been to all 99
counties in the

03:23.270 --> 03:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great state of Iowa. This is our
final stop
on caucus day.

03:28.075 --> 03:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marco Rubio,
who's polling
third here, has been tamping
down expectations,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even as he works overtime.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: We recognize
we're not the
front-runner. We know we are an
underdog,

03:39.686 --> 03:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but we feel good about it.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The candidates
who've struggled
in Iowa aren't even sticking
around for the

03:44.925 --> 03:46.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
caucuses.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
If I do well in New Hampshire,
everybody's

03:47.527 --> 03:49.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to know who I am.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Kasich,
staking his campaign
on the New Hampshire primary,
was there through

03:52.999 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the weekend.

03:54.801 --> 03:59.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while Jeb Bush and Chris
Christie were
here earlier today, both will be
following

03:59.272 --> 04:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caucus results from the Granite
State.

04:02.642 --> 04:08.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is one more wild card: the
weather.
Much of Iowa is in for a winter
storm in the

04:08.315 --> 04:13.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hours just ahead. Whatever
tonight's results,
the presidential race is heading
into new

04:13.954 --> 04:15.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turbulence all its own.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hi there, Judy.

04:17.724 --> 04:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and I combined have covered
our share
of Iowa caucus nights, but this
one seems

04:22.496 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more mysterious, more kind of
amazing and
unpredictable than ever.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right.

04:29.336 --> 04:34.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and I both covered these
Iowa caucuses
before. And I can remember some
really unpredictable

04:34.708 --> 04:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ones in the past, but, Gwen,
nothing like
this.

04:37.477 --> 04:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we're on the Republican
side, you have
a man who never served in public
office before

04:42.916 --> 04:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running for the highest office
in the land,
and he's been leading in the
polls ever since

04:47.521 --> 04:51.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he first got into the race.
That's Donald
Trump. The question tonight, of
course, as

04:51.825 --> 04:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody has been saying, is,
can he translate
that enthusiasm into getting
people to show

04:56.329 --> 05:01.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to their local schoolhouse,
their church,
or wherever these caucuses take
place and

05:01.434 --> 05:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get them to stand there and
stand up and say,
I'm for Donald Trump?

05:04.871 --> 05:09.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, just as
unpredictable,
Hillary Clinton, the favorite,
and yet Bernie

05:09.476 --> 05:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, the one Democratic
socialist in the
U.S. Senate, is giving her a run
for the money.

05:15.949 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is the same
there. Can he
turn that enthusiasm into votes?

05:19.519 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It seems like all
the conventional
wisdom is out the window
tonight.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it really
is.

05:27.027 --> 05:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I just heard the
most revered
pollster in the state say, Ann
Selzer, says

05:33.033 --> 05:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she -- when people say what
are the issues
in this campaign, she said there
really haven't

05:37.804 --> 05:41.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been issues, especially on the
Republican
side. She said, this is an
election about

05:41.775 --> 05:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mood and about who can take the
country to
the next level, to the future.

05:48.114 --> 05:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she compared it -- she
said, this is
an election that stands alone.
And I think

05:52.552 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will see tonight if that
turns out to be
the case.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Good to see you on
the campus
of Drake University in Des
Moines tonight.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, Judy.

06:01.494 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy will be back with a closer
look at the
key voters who could determine
tonight's outcome

06:06.466 --> 06:08.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Health Organization
today declared
the Zika virus an international
public health

06:13.907 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency. The mosquito-borne
disease has
been linked to birth defects in
the Americas

06:18.745 --> 06:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involving babies born with
abnormally small
heads, or microcephaly.

06:24.017 --> 06:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, Margaret Chan,
director general
of the WHO, issued a call for
action.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARGARET CHAN, Director
General, World
Health Organization: The
committee advised

06:32.092 --> 06:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the causes of microcephaly
and other
neurological complications
constitute an extraordinary

06:42.369 --> 06:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event and a public health threat
to other
parts of the world. In their
view, a coordinated

06:49.843 --> 06:51.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
international response is
needed.

06:52.078 --> 06:57.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The WHO says
restrictions on foreign
travel and trade are not needed
yet, but it's

06:57.584 --> 07:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advising pregnant women in
affected countries
to take steps to prevent
mosquito bites.

07:02.856 --> 07:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, new violence
underscored the
government's struggle to
safeguard its own

07:07.761 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital. A suicide bomber blew
himself up
at a police headquarters in
Kabul, killing

07:12.932 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least 20 people and wounding
nearly 30
more. The Interior Ministry said
the Taliban

07:17.971 --> 07:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacker detonated the bomb as
he waited in
line to enter the facility. Most
of those

07:23.043 --> 07:25.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killed and injured were
civilians.

07:25.945 --> 07:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N.'s special envoy for
Syria announced
today the official start of
talks aimed at

07:31.051 --> 07:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ending the country's civil war.
That came
after a meeting with the main
opposition group,

07:35.955 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the High Negotiations Committee,
or HNC, in
Geneva. It wants an end to the
sieges and

07:42.195 --> 07:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
starvation of Syrian towns.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: We are actually
listening

07:46.599 --> 07:52.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with attention to the concerns
of HNC. And
we are going to tomorrow discuss
and listen

07:52.906 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the concerns of the
government. The discussions
are starting, but, meanwhile,
the challenge

07:59.012 --> 08:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is now, let's also have those
who have the
capacity of discussing this at a
different

08:05.752 --> 08:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level time to discuss about
cease-fire.

08:08.955 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, the U.S.
envoy charged
with fighting the Islamic State
was in Northern

08:13.993 --> 08:15.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syria over the weekend.

08:15.895 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brett McGurk is the first senior
U.S. official
to set foot in Syria since
August of 2014.

08:22.102 --> 08:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He met with a variety of groups
battling the
militants, and said ISIS forces
do not stand

08:27.006 --> 08:28.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a chance.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, newly
released documents
shed a bit more light on last
may's Amtrak

08:33.146 --> 08:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crash in Philadelphia. Eight
people died and
nearly 200 were hurt. Interview
transcripts

08:38.585 --> 08:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show the engineer, Brandon
Bostian, saying
he remembers trying to pick up
speed, then

08:43.890 --> 08:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hitting the brakes when the
train hit a sharp
curve, going too fast.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But lawyers for the victims said
they don't
believe him.

08:50.930 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MONGELUZZI, Attorney:
There was no
problem with the signals, no
problem with

08:55.468 --> 09:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tracks, no problem with the
locomotive,
no problem with the brakes. And
what we have

09:01.408 --> 09:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learned is, the problem was
Brandon Bostian.

09:04.310 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that his inconsistent
story speaks
volumes about him and his
credibility and

09:11.317 --> 09:13.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
believability at trial.

09:13.319 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The National
Transportation Safety
Board says it has not yet
reached any conclusions

09:17.857 --> 09:20.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the cause of the crash.

09:20.260 --> 09:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
struggled to hold
their own after a new plunge in
oil prices.

09:25.198 --> 09:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 17 points
to close below 16450. The Nasdaq
rose six

09:32.172 --> 09:35.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped
a fraction
of a point.

09:36.009 --> 09:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the evangelical
vote can make or break GOP
candidates and

09:42.182 --> 09:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why Republicans are revolting
against the
establishment; plus, full
analysis of the

09:47.120 --> 10:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa caucuses from David Brooks,
Michelle
Cottle, and our Politics Monday
duo.

10:05.104 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Almost every presidential
election produces
a bloc of voters who become a
barometer for

10:10.276 --> 10:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the outcome. On Friday, we
looked at the role
women voters of different ages
will play in

10:15.448 --> 10:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Democratic caucuses here in
Iowa.

10:18.017 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at a bloc of
voters who will
help foretell results on the
Republican side.

10:27.727 --> 10:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, yesterday was just
like any
other Sunday at The Kathedral,
an evangelical

10:32.966 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian church in Iowa's
capital, Des Moines.
Worshipers came together for a
morning of

10:38.171 --> 10:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prayer and enthusiastic song.

10:41.474 --> 10:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it came time for the
sermon, Pastor
Kenney Linhart left no doubt
what he expects

10:50.183 --> 10:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his congregates to do come
Monday night.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR KENNEY LINHART, The
Kathedral: You
want to see things change in
Iowa? Do you

10:54.287 --> 10:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to see the glory of God
come down to
Iowa? Then you need to be
involved in the

10:58.758 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political process.

11:00.693 --> 11:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Only a fraction
of Iowa voters
typically go to caucus. But of
those who attend

11:05.365 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican side, half are
expected
to be evangelical, or born-again
Christians.

11:12.438 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa pollster Ann Selzer says,
even as her
latest survey shows Donald Trump
leading among

11:17.777 --> 11:21.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans overall, Ted Cruz is
ahead among
evangelicals.

11:21.648 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER, President, Selzer
&amp; Company:
We see surprises all the time
coming from

11:25.552 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the evangelical vote and that's
why you have
to look at Ted Cruz and his
ability to organize

11:31.624 --> 11:36.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that group as a potential
surprise on caucus
night.

11:36.229 --> 11:42.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was
evangelicals who helped
propel Mike Huckabee in 2008 and
Rick Santorum

11:42.335 --> 11:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four years ago to victory here.
This year,
not only are Huckabee and
Santorum competing

11:48.308 --> 11:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for those votes. So is a cluster
of other
Republicans.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Radio Iowa's O. Kay Henderson:

11:54.614 --> 11:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON, News Director,
Radio Iowa:
Nine months ago, Rand Paul was
trying to lock

11:57.550 --> 12:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in evangelical supporters. You
have Ben Carson,
who has really kept a core of
support, and

12:02.689 --> 12:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that comes from the states'
evangelical churches.

12:05.258 --> 12:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have Donald Trump, who has
lined up an
important endorsement from the
president of

12:09.996 --> 12:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Liberty University. And you have
Ted Cruz,
who has an effort to try to get
a pastor in

12:16.536 --> 12:18.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
each precinct in Iowa.

12:19.005 --> 12:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the former
chairman of
the Iowa Republican Party, Matt
Strawn, says

12:24.243 --> 12:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the evangelical voters these
candidates are
after don't all have the same
priorities.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATT STRAWN, Former Iowa
Republican Party
Chairman: Take a look at Ted
Cruz. Part of

12:31.951 --> 12:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his coalition with people like
Bob Vander
Plaats, radio personality Steve
Deace, very

12:37.690 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-establishment evangelical
Christians,
the type that want to blow up
the system and

12:43.329 --> 12:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start over, as opposed to maybe
a larger group
of Iowa Christian conservatives
that would

12:47.934 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be the progeny of the Pat
Robertson movement
in the 1980s, Ralph Reed
Christian Coalition,

12:53.072 --> 12:57.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more pragmatic Christian
conservatives who
want to work within the system
to shape it

12:57.510 --> 12:59.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
towards their beliefs.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're the folks that are
your traditional
caucus-goers that are still
largely up for

13:02.749 --> 13:04.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grabs.

13:04.751 --> 13:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This latter
group, Strawn says,
have elected mainstream
Republicans to office

13:08.154 --> 13:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here for years. But that's
exactly what Christian
conservative leader Bob Vander
Plaats says

13:14.527 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he doesn't want to see this
time. He's backing
Cruz.

13:17.664 --> 13:22.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB VANDER PLAATS, CEO, The
Family Leader:
We trust conversions on the road
to Damascus.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We question conversions on the
road to Des
Moines. And so we take a look
at, what were

13:26.539 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they doing before they ran for
president?
And so, at age 13, you know,
he's memorizing

13:31.210 --> 13:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Constitution. He's deeply
threaded with
the Judeo-Christian world view.

13:36.182 --> 13:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: What I want to
ask of each
of you is that you pray just a
minute a day,

13:42.989 --> 13:52.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that you say, father God,
continue this awakening,
continue this spirit of revival.
Awaken the

13:52.231 --> 13:54.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
body of Christ.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The divide has
grown into a
kind of internal war. Another
prominent voice

13:58.604 --> 14:04.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
inside Iowa's Christian
conservative community,
Pastor Jamie Johnson, says Cruz
has hit a

14:04.610 --> 14:06.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ceiling within the group.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PASTOR JAMIE JOHNSON,
Cornerstone World Outreach:
It could be his personality,
that he naturally

14:08.848 --> 14:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seems to rub people the wrong
way.

14:11.317 --> 14:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnson, who
pastored churches
for 25 years, believes Trump
could surprise

14:17.090 --> 14:18.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyone tonight.

14:19.058 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR JAMIE JOHNSON: I would
say that Iowa's
evangelicals are cautious, but
excited about

14:25.898 --> 14:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the possibility of a President
Trump. And
they feel that he may have the
iron will that

14:32.805 --> 14:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is necessary to do a lot of the
things that
have frustrated Iowa
evangelicals and probably

14:38.478 --> 14:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evangelicals across the nation
for many years
now.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bob Vander Plaats
couldn't
disagree more.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB VANDER PLAATS: He's a guy
that says he
doesn't have to ask God for
forgiveness. He's

14:47.186 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a guy that disparages prisoners
of war by
saying, "I like veterans who
aren't captured."

14:52.091 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a guy who mocks people with
disabilities.

14:54.427 --> 14:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
My mother gave me this Bible,
this very Bible,

14:59.198 --> 15:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many years ago.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kathedral's
Kenney Linhart
questions Trump's sincerity.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR KENNEY LINHART: How
tattered are the
pages of that Bible? And how
much of that

15:07.907 --> 15:09.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bible does he know?

15:09.876 --> 15:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Pastor Jamie
Johnson argues
many Iowa evangelicals are even
more focused

15:14.914 --> 15:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on finding a strong leader for
the country
and someone who can win in
November.

15:19.652 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR JAMIE JOHNSON: I think
there's a willingness
on the part of many self
described born-again

15:24.791 --> 15:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christians that are willing to
take a chance
on Trump, and pray that God will
guide him

15:31.364 --> 15:33.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a moral and ethical
direction.

15:33.533 --> 15:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnson defends
Trump's expressions
of faith, as do voters like
Kathy Simpson,

15:39.572 --> 15:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who showed up yesterday to hear
Trump speak
in Council Bluffs.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY SIMPSON, Trump Supporter:
There are
people who don't think Trump is
a religious

15:46.112 --> 15:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person. I know that he is a
religious person.

15:51.117 --> 15:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some who belong
to Pastor Linhart's
church have a different take.
Several brought

15:57.056 --> 16:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up Trump calling a New Testament
book 2 Corinthians.

16:00.159 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: 2 Corinthians
3:17, that's the
whole ball game.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE MONROE, Church Member: If
he can't
pronounce the Bible verse the
correct way,

16:06.866 --> 16:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it doesn't give me a lot of
faith. I mean,
my 2-year-old knows how to say a
Scripture.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brenda McGinnis
is enthusiastically
for Marco Rubio.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRENDA MCGINNIS, Rubio
Supporter: I have heard
him talk about his salvation. I
have heard

16:18.644 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
him use the name of Jesus
Christ, which is
very important to me.

16:22.448 --> 16:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rubio spoke about
his faith
to a crowd near Des Moines this
weekend.

16:26.752 --> 16:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: You better
hope that my
that my faith influences me,
because I'm a

16:30.656 --> 16:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
follower of Jesus Christ. And
Jesus Christ
taught us that, in order to
follow him, we

16:35.695 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to care and love for one
another.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pastor Linhart
likes what he
hears.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR KENNEY LINHART: Marco
Rubio has come
out so well with his faith so
strong, not

16:42.468 --> 16:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just said he is a Christian, but
that he believes
that the word of God should
direct his life.

16:48.107 --> 16:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whether it's the
deciding factor
or not in the Republican
contest, Pastor Linhart

16:54.347 --> 16:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believes it's critical for the
Christian community
to make its voice heard.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR KENNEY LINHART: As you go
about this
election cycle tomorrow night,
you pray and

17:02.788 --> 17:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ask that God shows you the men
and women who
are subjected to his spirit,
because if God

17:06.993 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to change the nation,
he's going
to do it through human vessels.

17:21.173 --> 17:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to Politics
Monday. And what
a big Monday it is.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And back to Judy in Iowa.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier today, I
spoke with
someone who knows Iowa politics
as well as

17:33.185 --> 17:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody. He is Republican Chuck
Grassley,
who has served as this state's
senior U.S.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senator for the last 35 years.

17:41.227 --> 17:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked him what he makes of
Donald Trump's
appeal in his home state.

17:45.598 --> 17:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
It's a wakeup
call to everybody in the
Republican -- who

17:50.803 --> 17:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could be our nominee, and you
have kind of
got to not worry so much about
his political

17:56.275 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
philosophy, right or left. You
have got to
see him as a messenger and the
frustration

18:03.749 --> 18:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the American people have,
and whoever
is our candidate has to respond
to that frustration.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're completely
comfortable
if Ted Cruz were to pull off a
win here?

18:12.725 --> 18:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY: I think
the best way
to answer your question is that
I don't want

18:18.064 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a third term of an Obama
presidency.

18:20.866 --> 18:27.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that
lead-in, I'm joined
here in Iowa by Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy

18:27.173 --> 18:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here we are. We're on the
ground. The day
has come.

18:31.978 --> 18:36.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, Amy, it is really
interesting to see
how a senior Republican in the
state of Iowa,

18:36.916 --> 18:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Grassley, is reacting to
this extraordinary
field of candidates for
president this year.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: That
is exactly right. There are a
couple of things

18:44.223 --> 18:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on. First, Chuck Grassley
is up for
reelection this year. He doesn't
have competition

18:48.361 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

18:50.262 --> 18:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But so many Republicans who
dismissed the
idea early onñ of the Tea Party
or who said

18:55.134 --> 18:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these aren't people who
turn out and
vote, they were swamped in
previous elections.

18:59.205 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's learned his lesson, to
say you can't
dismiss what is potentially
another bubbling

19:04.043 --> 19:05.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
movement.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hear that a lot too from
folks maybe
who don't want to see Donald
Trump win, but

19:08.581 --> 19:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say we can't alienate his
supporters.
Even if we quietly cheer for
somebody else,

19:14.053 --> 19:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have got to make sure to keep
those people
engaged. They need the turnout
in November

19:18.758 --> 19:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for whoever the Republican
candidate is.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump has just
raised the unpredictability
factor enormously, hasn't he,
Tamara?

19:25.064 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
I am pretty sure that we have
predicted many

19:29.068 --> 19:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that have been wrong over
the last
six months.

19:32.271 --> 19:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump just never ceases to
surprise. One thing
that is really interesting in
the numbers

19:36.709 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have seen in recent
polling is that
his support is very broad-based.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It isn't just
people who are
looking for an outsider. He gets
some evangelicals,

19:45.751 --> 19:50.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some of them. He gets
establishment Republicans.
He get conservative Republicans.
He probably

19:50.322 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some independents and Democrats,
too. He is
just -- it's unpredictable.

19:55.961 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Ted Cruz
presence here,
though, Amy, is another
interesting piece

20:01.467 --> 20:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this, because he started out
-- you know,
we all know he's the Republican
who the other

20:05.838 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans don't necessarily
like that much.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Correct.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he has really
worked this
state. And he's going into this
-- these caucuses

20:14.080 --> 20:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with what appears to be a really
strong organization.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: He's running the
playbook that
has worked traditionally for
Republicans,

20:20.886 --> 20:26.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which is hit every single
county, and, as
he said, come here, work the
ground very hard.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has ground troops here.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He even has a dormitory to host
all of his
volunteers, so they can stay
here and basically

20:32.331 --> 20:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work around the clock. And he
thought by sewing
up the evangelical lane, the
Christian conservative,

20:39.238 --> 20:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social conservative lane, which
makes up anywhere
from 55 percent to 60 percent of
the vote,

20:43.742 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would get him the victory.

20:45.544 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem, as Tamara pointed
out and as
you have too, is that that
evangelical vote

20:50.116 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is much more diffused, that
they're supporting,
many of them, Donald Trump, who
in no way,

20:55.221 --> 20:57.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
shape or form fits the
traditional evangelical
model.

20:57.957 --> 21:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But for Ted Cruz,
Tamara, it's
-- he has to know that Donald
Trump is still

21:03.395 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the big story coming out of this
state.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One way or another, the
headlines are going
to be about Donald Trump. Either
Donald Trump

21:08.868 --> 21:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wins or Donald Trump loses. But
the other
thing is that Ted Cruz really,
with this ground

21:14.073 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
operation, he raised the
expectations for
himself here in Iowa, especially
because a

21:19.778 --> 21:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
previous poll showed him up
pretty significantly.

21:22.781 --> 21:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Iowa in some way is really
about expectations.
And so, if Ted Cruz comes out of
this and

21:29.688 --> 21:33.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's -- and the headline is
Donald Trump wins,
Ted Cruz doesn't live up to
expectations,

21:34.059 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or Marco Rubio exceeds
expectations, there
is an expectations game here.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
Democrats? Let's
talk about Hillary Clinton,
Bernie Sanders.

21:42.668 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, it seems to me that she has
honed in
on her message in the last few
weeks in a

21:49.341 --> 21:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way that we didn't see early in
this campaign.

21:51.677 --> 21:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, and you have
seen it, too,
with her messaging on the
campaign trail and

21:57.016 --> 22:01.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
somewhat, too, in her
advertising, really
focusing in on, I have been
consistently there

22:02.087 --> 22:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for you, I'm a progressive that
can get things
done, as opposed to a
progressive who has

22:08.994 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
big grand ideas that are
unlikely to get passed,
and so trying to keep drilling
into that as

22:16.168 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much as she can, while not
abandoning the
fact that she sees herself as
liberal as her

22:23.075 --> 22:24.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
opponent.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, you and I
were at a
Hillary Clinton event last
night.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it seems to
me that Bernie
Sanders has had a clear -- has
left a clear

22:32.751 --> 22:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impression on -- not only on her
campaign
and the way she's running it,
but on that

22:37.022 --> 22:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message. I mean, she's moved to
the left,
not as far left. She's
distinguishing herself

22:40.993 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from him, but it's had a huge
effect on what
she's saying.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

22:46.765 --> 22:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is definitely and, from
early on, really
emphasized the progressive part
of her message,

22:52.738 --> 22:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that has continued. One
thing that I think
is really interesting, that I
have been watching

22:55.908 --> 23:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her give her stump speech, well,
for months,
but, in particular, in the last
10 days or

23:01.780 --> 23:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so, her stump speech really
hasn't changed.

23:04.350 --> 23:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has locked in the message,
that contrast
with Sanders. There is no
frantic changing

23:09.555 --> 23:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of message as the caucuses
approach. There
is a certain confidence in the
way she's moving

23:14.260 --> 23:15.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In these final
days.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: In these final
days. She's just
locked in.

23:18.330 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you --
what do you
see, Amy, in the Sanders camp?
Because, for

23:22.735 --> 23:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, at one point, he wasn't
give a chance
in this state.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now he's very
close.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Now he's very close.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he's doing right now,
you can see
Bernie Sanders and his campaign
trying to

23:33.178 --> 23:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
temper expectations: We don't
necessarily
have to win here to keep going
here.

23:38.050 --> 23:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has raised a tremendous
amount of money.
What is it, $20 million, just in
this month.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Twenty million
dollars, yes.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, he has the money
to keep going.

23:45.057 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're advertising already in
the states
that come next, South Carolina,
Nevada, New

23:48.927 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, and that, if Hillary
Clinton wants
to play the long game, we're
more than happy

23:53.599 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do that, too. We're not going
away just
because we might not get what we
want in Iowa.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we will hold it close.

24:00.306 --> 24:04.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The other thing we always
forget, whoever
wins this only gets a handful of
delegates.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a teeny, tiny fraction.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. We keep
forgetting to
talk about that.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We always forget
about that. And
the delegate game is one that is
going to

24:11.250 --> 24:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take a long time to flesh out.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, Tamara,
when I heard
him say yesterday that he has
now received

24:16.655 --> 24:25.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
3.2 million different
contributions from Americans,
more than any campaign in
history, I mean,

24:25.130 --> 24:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that really says something,
doesn't it?

24:26.432 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And the average
donation is
$27.

24:29.168 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people are passionate and
they are not
tapped out. They haven't reached
-- they're

24:33.405 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not even close to the maximum
that they can
give. And they can just send out
fund-raising

24:37.810 --> 24:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail after fund-raising e-mail
and -- or
texts -- and people will just
send more money

24:42.748 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he -- his campaign really
believes that
they have the money to push this
forward and

24:48.454 --> 24:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue into many, many, many
states past
Super Tuesday.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just a few
seconds left.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you going to remember
this campaign
for?

24:55.728 --> 24:56.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

(CROSSTALK)

24:57.463 --> 24:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, I know what
you're going
to say.

24:58.297 --> 24:58.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:58.731 --> 24:59.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:59.531 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ... very different.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We always talk about, it's all
about the turnout,
but never has it been more
important. Tonight

25:05.904 --> 25:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the night we're going to find
out if the
Trump phenomenon is real, if he
can turn those

25:12.111 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new people out. And we have just
a few more
hours before we get that answer.
Can't wait.

25:17.916 --> 25:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can we wait?

25:18.817 --> 25:19.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:19.451 --> 25:21.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara?

25:21.453 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, in terms of
things I will
remember, I guess it is the --
chasing Hillary

25:26.458 --> 25:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, trying to figure out
where she was
going to be on that very first
day in Iowa.

25:30.429 --> 25:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the Scooby van
that she drove
across country shows up at a
little coffee

25:35.601 --> 25:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shop in Le Claire, and, you
know, we're off
to the races.

25:38.937 --> 25:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will get that
picture and
look at it.

25:40.639 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:41.607 --> 25:42.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Feels like a long
time ago.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara Keith, Amy
Walter, thank
you both. We will see a lot of
you tonight.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we want to dig
into the numbers
just a bit, not just the
results, but key

25:51.917 --> 25:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
facts about Iowa and Iowans.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan breaks it down
-- Hari.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

25:59.124 --> 26:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our data team looked to see
Iowa's track record
in picking winners and how
similar Iowans

26:03.829 --> 26:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are to the rest of the country.
The caucuses
are far from a perfect predictor
of who goes

26:08.634 --> 26:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to become the party's nominee
or eventually
to the White House.

26:12.204 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, for Democrats, it is
slightly better
than flipping a coin. The
caucuses have picked

26:16.842 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidate correctly 55
percent of the
time. For Republicans, the
process has only

26:21.380 --> 26:23.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been right 43 percent of the
time.

26:24.016 --> 26:29.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, in 1992,
three-quarters of Iowa
Democrats stood behind longtime
Iowa Senator

26:29.254 --> 26:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Harkin. That year, Bill
Clinton only received
3 percent of the votes, but
later went on

26:35.027 --> 26:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to serve two terms as president.

26:36.962 --> 26:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do have better indicators
today to which
candidate has been on the minds
of Iowans

26:41.967 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the week leading up to
tonight. Over the
last week, Facebook users in
Iowa had more

26:46.538 --> 26:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say about Donald Trump than
any other presidential
candidate, Republican or
Democrat. You saw

26:51.877 --> 26:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that same trend nationwide.
Behind Trump on
the Republican side were Ted
Cruz, Marco Rubio,

26:57.583 --> 27:01.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and Ben Carson. And among
Democrats, Iowans
had the most to say about
Hillary Clinton,

27:01.920 --> 27:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed by Bernie Sanders and
then Martin
O'Malley.

27:05.390 --> 27:10.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of the issues that most
concerned Iowans on
Facebook, crime and criminal
justice, abortion,

27:11.063 --> 27:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxes and the Affordable Care
Act, there was
only one topic the rest of the
country was

27:15.400 --> 27:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about. That's Wall
Street and financial
regulation. According to
Facebook, the rest

27:20.472 --> 27:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the nation is also talking
about topics
including religion, racism and
discrimination,

27:27.012 --> 27:29.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs and Benghazi.

27:29.181 --> 27:33.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But who are today's Iowans, and
how do they
compare to the rest of the
country? They register

27:34.052 --> 27:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote slightly more than the
rest of the
nation. In 2012, three out of
four Iowans

27:38.924 --> 27:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were registered, vs. two out of
three Americans.
Among Iowans 18 or older, the
state's median

27:44.196 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
household income is $53,712,
almost exactly
the national average.

27:50.402 --> 27:55.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the poverty rate, 11
percent, is also
similar the rest of the United
States. But

27:55.140 --> 28:00.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a significant
difference. And that's
race. According to the census,
about nine

28:00.445 --> 28:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of 10 Iowans are white.
Nationwide, that
number is far lower, about
two-thirds. Fewer

28:06.418 --> 28:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latino and African-American
voters call Iowa
home, compared to the rest of
the nation -- Gwen.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Hari.

28:14.092 --> 28:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on that note, we now turn to
the analysis
of Brooks and Cottle. That's
Michelle Cottle

28:18.530 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "The Atlantic" and David
Brooks, columnist
with The New York Times. Mark
Shields has

28:22.634 --> 28:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been under the weather, but we
look forward
to his full recovery and his
return to our

28:26.204 --> 28:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign coverage very soon.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

28:30.309 --> 28:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks, give me a sense
about -- Charlie
Cook, the great prognosticator
who writes

28:37.049 --> 28:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for The Cook -- of course, runs
The Cook Political
Report, he wrote a story today
about the difference

28:40.819 --> 28:42.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between emotion and
organization.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In this election, in this
caucus, what are
we seeing?

28:46.091 --> 28:50.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, we're seeing
emotion both
on the Sanders side and the
Trump side.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, I think Trump
revolutionized American
politics, whatever happened
tonight, with

28:54.566 --> 28:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that first debate performance
way back when,
when he started insulting the
looks of other

28:59.004 --> 29:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates, insulating the
moderators, live-tweeting
throughout the campaign, calling
people morons

29:04.776 --> 29:06.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and idiots.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He introduce an entirely new
vocabulary into
American politics, an entirely
different style

29:10.749 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of doing politics. He was
inducted into the
Professional Wrestling Hall of
Fame in 2013.

29:17.055 --> 29:21.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He basically took the
professional wrestling
rhetoric and brought it into
American politics.

29:21.493 --> 29:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that revved up a lot of
people, a lot
of people who feel shut out, who
feel looked

29:25.130 --> 29:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down upon, who feel resentful or
who just
feel they are not being heard.
Suddenly, it

29:28.867 --> 29:33.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was the style, it was the
grammar. They felt
that was against political
correctness and

29:33.105 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they felt revved up.

29:35.007 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, will they turn
out tonight?
If they do, it will be some sort
of historic

29:39.378 --> 29:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, not only for Trump, but a
change in
the way we think about political
rhetoric

29:42.881 --> 29:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the way campaigns are run.

29:44.750 --> 29:48.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So, Michelle,
assuming that all
these rules have gone out the
window, as David

29:49.054 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
suggests, is that a good thing?

29:50.956 --> 29:55.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, I think
Americans think
it's time to shake up the
political process.

29:55.260 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, whatever happens,
you know, in
the long run with Trump, I think
he's had

29:59.831 --> 30:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an impact and kind of woken up
both parties
as to the dissatisfaction with
how the entire

30:05.103 --> 30:10.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process was being run. So, I
think it will
go beyond this election, and
even the people

30:10.676 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who roll their eyes at him
starting out have
had to kind of go, hmm, well,
he's resonating

30:15.914 --> 30:17.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on some level.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask
you, starting
with you, and then I will turn
to David on

30:20.018 --> 30:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. Why -- as we watch the
caucusers head
out tonight, why is the
Democratic race so

30:26.291 --> 30:28.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
close?

30:28.160 --> 30:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, you know,
the Clintons
have their charms, but Hillary
Clinton has

30:33.432 --> 30:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a particular problem with
inspiration.
She is not an inspirational
candidate.

30:38.336 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's kind of what Sanders
is pitching
these days. We were talking
earlier about,

30:43.341 --> 30:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not about the issues. It's
kind of more
a tone that's dominating this
race. And Hillary

30:49.514 --> 30:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has the experience and
the pragmatism
thing down perfectly, but she's
not the hopey,

30:54.219 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changey candidate this time
around.

30:56.188 --> 31:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so despite having really
good organization
and a lot of turnout, Bernie is
the guy who's

31:03.428 --> 31:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making people's hearts go pitter
pat out there.

31:05.397 --> 31:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, David, whatever
happened to
the Obama coalition that
surprised everybody

31:09.701 --> 31:11.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Iowa in 2008?

31:11.737 --> 31:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The financial
crisis happened,
and a lot of things happened.

31:15.273 --> 31:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I what has happened is, there
has been a tectonic
shift in the landscape of the
American electorate

31:19.644 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caused by the financial crisis,
caused by
wage stagnation, caused by the
-- just the

31:24.783 --> 31:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic strain a lot of people
are under.

31:27.285 --> 31:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Democratic side, that
led to Bernie
Sanders, somebody who said,
we're going to

31:30.789 --> 31:34.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get government a lot more
radical in helping
the little guy. And the
Republican side, I

31:34.292 --> 31:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it sort of had the same
deal. Donald
Trump is ideologically
completely inconsistent,

31:39.364 --> 31:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he's sort of on the side of
the little
guy.

31:41.466 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of us were reading
all these
sociology books called "Coming
Apart" by Charles

31:47.305 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Murray, "Our Kids" by Robert
Putnam of Harvard,
and we were seeing an America
that was bifurcating.

31:52.778 --> 31:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think I sort of missed how
that would
affect this campaign, but it is
affecting

31:57.382 --> 31:59.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, David, let me
ask you this.
Is ideology, as you point out --
if Trump

32:01.386 --> 32:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has exploded our idea of
ideology, does that
mean ideology is dead? On the
other hand,

32:06.858 --> 32:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Trump -- Bernie Trump --
Bernie Sanders
used to be all about ideology.
Does that mean

32:11.463 --> 32:13.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's stronger?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it means the
parties are
polarized, because on one side,
you have got

32:15.534 --> 32:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders calling for a
massive increase
in government. On the other
side, you have

32:17.936 --> 32:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got Ted Cruz calling for a
massive decrease
in government.

32:21.106 --> 32:26.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we're splitting apart
ideologically as
well. I don't think ideology is
dead, but

32:26.311 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's being reacted to in
different ways in
the two parties. In the
Democratic Party,

32:29.681 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's an economic -- people want
some economic
change.

32:33.685 --> 32:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Republican side, people
want -- they
fear immigrants are driving down
their wages.

32:37.656 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want some cultural change.
They want
a change in authority
structures. So we have

32:41.259 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got the fundamental problem
which is being
refracted in two different ways.

32:44.529 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Michelle, what is
the -- what
is left for the establishment
bracket, as

32:48.600 --> 32:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have come to call them, Jeb
Bush, Marco
Rubio, Chris Christie, John
Kasich?

32:53.738 --> 32:56.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, coming
out of tonight,
people are going to be looking
very closely

32:57.075 --> 32:59.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at how well Rubio does.

32:59.144 --> 33:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio is seen -- right now, he's
trending
a bit in the days running up to
the caucuses.

33:04.149 --> 33:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's seen as the establishment's
last, best
hope at this point. So, if he
outperforms

33:09.454 --> 33:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expectations, or at least hits
expectations,
then I think you will see people
move to coalesce

33:14.259 --> 33:15.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around him.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I promise I won't
hold you to
this, except that I will.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:18.730 --> 33:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What margin does
someone like
Marco Rubio or even someone like
Bernie Sanders,

33:21.499 --> 33:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what margin is a victory for
them tonight?

33:23.869 --> 33:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, I think
if you're looking
at a third-place victory for
Rubio, he needs

33:28.974 --> 33:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, you know, better than
middle teens.
He needs middle teens and up.
Anything below

33:34.179 --> 33:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is going to be seen as a
big disappointment.

33:37.082 --> 33:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Above that, you know, he doesn't
have to win.
He doesn't even have to come in
second. Now,

33:40.819 --> 33:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he manages to come in second,
there is
going to be a complete uproar.
But, going

33:44.956 --> 33:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward, if he becomes the guy
who outperformed
or at least hit expectations in
his trending

33:49.628 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iowa, then you will see the
establishment
kind of coalesce and get excited
about that

33:54.933 --> 33:56.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possibility.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's almost -- only
fair that
I hold your feet to the fire on
the same point,

33:59.070 --> 34:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David. What is your -- what
margins are you
watching for tonight?

34:02.073 --> 34:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First of all, I
think this is
going to be a long campaign, so
this will

34:04.976 --> 34:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a chapter, not a death knell
for anybody.

34:06.912 --> 34:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I agree with Michelle. I
think if Rubio's
north of 16, he looks pretty
good. I think

34:11.583 --> 34:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if Cruz is north of 24 or 25, he
looks pretty
good. If Trump is up at 30, if
all his people

34:16.988 --> 34:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up, then he looks amazing.
And so -- but
I could possibly see Cruz
winning this thing.

34:23.828 --> 34:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know his voters will turn
out. The Trump
voters are a bit of a mystery.

34:27.365 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:27.999 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Go ahead.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: On the Sanders
side, I think
he has got to get north of 43 or
so, and then

34:32.537 --> 34:34.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he will look pretty good.

34:34.439 --> 34:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned in
passing -- and
I'm going to ask Michelle about
this -- the

34:36.541 --> 34:38.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difference between Iowa and
everyplace else.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Going forward, this is a
chapter. It's true.
And, tonight, we're obsessed
with it, but,

34:41.780 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow, we will be obsessed
with New Hampshire
and then down the road. How
different is Iowa

34:48.153 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the rest of the country as
we go forward
in this process?

34:51.056 --> 34:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, Iowa is
-- as we have
noted, it's very white, it's
rural, it's older

34:57.662 --> 35:01.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
voters. It's also -- its
Democratic electorate
is very liberal.

35:01.199 --> 35:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those quants at FiveThirtyEight
crunched the
numbers and found the three best
states in

35:05.170 --> 35:10.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country for Bernie Sanders
is Vermont,
Iowa and New Hampshire. And then
after that,

35:10.809 --> 35:16.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you can't really win the
Democratic primary
if you can't talk to nonwhite
voters. And

35:16.815 --> 35:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it's going to be very -- it's
going to
shift dramatically once we're
past this for

35:20.685 --> 35:22.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Democrats.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Hillary Clinton
has been to
Iowa on her behalf or her
husband's behalf

35:25.256 --> 35:30.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a long time. Why is this --
why is he
such a real challenge to her? Is
it because

35:30.662 --> 35:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she has tied herself so closely
to the president
or something else?

35:33.164 --> 35:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Well, it's a
couple of things.

35:35.166 --> 35:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, the numbers have been
thrown around.
There's a big chunk of Iowa
Democratic caucus-goers

35:39.204 --> 35:44.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that consider themselves
socialists. They're
more liberal. The Clintons are
not the left

35:44.275 --> 35:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wing of the party. They also
don't talk in
terms of revolution.

35:48.646 --> 35:54.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, temperamentally, the
zeitgeist just isn't
there. In 2008, there was much
talk about

35:55.020 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the organization wasn't
there and Hillary
didn't spend enough time in the
state. This

35:59.024 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, she has tried to remedy
that. But there
is also still this sense that
she's not as

36:05.630 --> 36:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down and removed. There's too
much security,
there's too much structure.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have talked to Iowa voters who
complain
that, when they go to her
events, they can't

36:13.104 --> 36:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really get close to her. So,
it's just -- it's
a combination of things that
make it tough

36:17.542 --> 36:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for her. But it's one state and
it's a state
that's tiny and we will move on.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, David, it's
almost become
-- we're exploding conventional
wisdom left

36:26.584 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and right tonight, but one of
the pieces of
conventional wisdom involving
Hillary Clinton

36:30.288 --> 36:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that it's just her moment
isn't quite there,
that she hasn't connected, that
things like

36:35.894 --> 36:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these e-mails have raised such a
dust that
it makes people think, I don't
know if I trust

36:41.433 --> 36:42.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something that is just
unique to the
early voting states?

36:45.904 --> 36:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's a drag on
her, but I would
just point out that, eight years
ago, she

36:49.874 --> 36:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a lot better after a defeat,
got a lot
better as a candidate. I would
also point

36:53.912 --> 36:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out that, when her husband ran
in 1992 -- I
forget the exact numbers -- he
lost a ton

36:57.649 --> 36:58.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the first 10 contests.

36:58.983 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

37:00.351 --> 37:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: This thing can go
on, and she
will get better.

37:02.353 --> 37:06.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She hasn't found a focus yet,
the way Sanders
has a focus. He was born with a
focus. She

37:06.891 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has not found it. But I wouldn't
be surprised
if in a month or two, she's
honed on something

37:12.630 --> 37:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just caused by the pressure of
defeat, the
near-death experience.

37:15.533 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I wanted to
circle back to
the establishment question with
you, David,

37:19.304 --> 37:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, as we speak tonight,
none of -- I
think Jeb Bush, and Chris
Christie and John

37:24.843 --> 37:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kasich are all already in New
Hampshire.

37:26.644 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have already -- John Kasich
said, ah,
I'm moving on. Is that -- we
have seen people

37:31.783 --> 37:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survive after losing in Iowa,
obviously. Is
that possible for Republicans as
well in this

37:36.821 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
environment?

37:37.555 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, totally.

37:39.457 --> 37:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rick Santorum won here. Mike
Huckabee won
here. This can nominate -- this
can sometimes

37:44.762 --> 37:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give -- hand victory to people
who don't move
on. And so for a Chris Christie,
there was

37:49.367 --> 37:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never going to be a good kind of
place. So,
we will be sitting here in
April, I think,

37:54.139 --> 37:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still talking about this race,
especially
on the Republican side. So they
still have

37:57.442 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decent shots.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be sitting
here in April,
Michelle?

37:59.978 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:01.513 --> 38:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: We will be
sitting here in
April talking about this.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be sitting
here.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: We will just
know a lot more
by then.

38:06.851 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be fascinating to
see what the
Trump story coming out of Iowa
is, because

38:11.856 --> 38:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's going to be about Trump, no
matter whether
win, lose or draw.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: But, you know,
come April,
we will have a lot more votes
having passed,

38:19.697 --> 38:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the story will be completely
different.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Michelle Cottle of
"The Atlantic,"
thank you for joining us
tonight, and David

38:24.969 --> 38:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brooks. We will talk to you all
night long.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Thanks.

38:29.040 --> 38:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As we wait for
voters to finally
have their say, political
director Lisa Desjardins

38:33.144 --> 38:38.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joins us now to share what she's
watching
for and what you, too, can watch
for later

38:38.316 --> 38:38.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

38:40.618 --> 38:41.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Lisa, what's
your secret things
of list you're watching for?

38:41.886 --> 38:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Got my charts.
I got my maps.

38:43.788 --> 38:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm excited in real time to sort
out what's
going on. And I think this will
bring together

38:47.025 --> 38:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything we have heard on the
program tonight.
Let's start with the Republicans
and what

38:51.596 --> 38:53.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to watch for.

38:53.431 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at a map of Iowa,
you can see
four basic areas where you
should watch for

38:56.834 --> 38:59.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans. These are areas
where there are
a lot of Republicans show up.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, look, we have a
map of Iowa.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Look at this. I
love television.

39:03.041 --> 39:08.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look in the upper
northwest corner,
that is a conservative hotbed.
That is an

39:08.446 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area where you would expect a
Ted Cruz needing
to do well. Now, if you look
closer to Des

39:13.084 --> 39:18.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moines, then you see areas where
it's less
conservative, but there are more
people. And

39:18.856 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's an area where, say, Mitt
Romney did
well four years ago, because he
got out a

39:22.594 --> 39:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of people, they didn't feel
strongly about
him, but a lot of them showed
up.

39:26.731 --> 39:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sort of correlates. If you
look at the
political divide in the
Republican Party,

39:31.502 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you see this conservative vs.
moderate trend
in Iowa. There, you see in the
brighter red

39:37.242 --> 39:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of the Mitt Romney or Ron
Paul groups.
Those are bigger cities.

39:40.912 --> 39:44.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as much as Hari talked about
the lack
of racial diversity compared to
the rest of

39:44.749 --> 39:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country in Iowa, they do
share with the
rest of the country, Iowans, a
common divide

39:50.755 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, which is urban vs.
rural. And
I think you will see that
tonight play out

39:55.860 --> 39:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Republican Party. It will
be close
to watch.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you take the
same formula
and apply it to the Democratic
Party, what

40:00.365 --> 40:01.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does that map look like?

40:01.266 --> 40:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So glad you
asked.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think we have
a map for
that.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, with Democrats, the key
is to watch
education centers, higher
education centers.

40:09.307 --> 40:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa has many of them, if you
look at the
University of Northern Iowa,
University of

40:13.311 --> 40:16.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iowa. I'm interested in
particular in the
Des Moines area. There is a huge
community

40:16.748 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college there. These are all
places, Gwen,
where Bernie Sanders needs to
get out his

40:20.618 --> 40:22.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

40:22.553 --> 40:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we see large voter turnout,
speaking to
Amy's point earlier in Politics
Monday, that's

40:26.758 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sign that Bernie Sanders is
going to have
a big night. Now, if these
places with young

40:30.428 --> 40:34.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
populations do not have large
turnout for
the Democrat, that's a good sign
for Hillary

40:34.599 --> 40:34.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

40:35.066 --> 40:35.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:35.633 --> 40:36.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Sorry.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which one of these
candidates
is exploiting those metrics the
most efficiently

40:39.170 --> 40:40.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this point?

40:41.039 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, we will
see tonight,
but I think, in the Democratic
side, there

40:44.175 --> 40:49.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a sense that Hillary Clinton
has a more
data-driven operation, that she
has identified

40:49.247 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her voters, that she is the one
more likely
to get them out.

40:53.017 --> 40:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Bernie Sanders is counting
on people
coming to show up who he doesn't
know. Maybe

40:57.322 --> 41:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're just coming because they
believe him
in, same kind of voters who
surprised everyone

41:01.726 --> 41:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the thousands by showing up
at his rallies.

41:03.895 --> 41:08.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, Ted Cruz
is playing
that role of the data wizard.
And we will

41:08.499 --> 41:11.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see. He's had a rough last
weekend. We will
see if that holds up.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Late night tonight,
Lisa?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:15.273 --> 41:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Oh, yes. And I
was up for
the whole nine yards last time.

41:18.710 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason it might be a little
faster, Gwen,
though, is an app -- imagine,
technology.

41:23.314 --> 41:27.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now the Republican and
Democratic parties
are both using an app so that
caucus organizers

41:27.719 --> 41:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will hit their phone with the
numbers of votes.
It even rejects what they enter
if it doesn't

41:33.191 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
add up correctly.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Oh.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, we may be
getting more
real-time numbers. Republicans,
we expect

41:38.696 --> 41:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first. The Democrats, they
usually take longer.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, you can always
spend another
night staring at your phone.

41:42.567 --> 41:43.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yay.

41:43.634 --> 41:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that's what we
will be doing.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:45.370 --> 41:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks very much,
Lisa. Talk to
you later.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Great.

41:47.905 --> 41:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Curious about how
the caucuses
actually work? Well, we have got
you covered.

41:51.309 --> 41:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Check out our helpful explainer
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now back to Judy in Iowa.

41:58.616 --> 42:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We close out,
Gwen, with a
look at the deep divides that
have opened

42:02.687 --> 42:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up inside the Republican Party
in this election,
and a fight over core
conservative principles.

42:09.293 --> 42:12.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our report is part of a
collaboration with
"The Atlantic."

42:12.463 --> 42:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM, Former Speechwriter
for Former
President George W. Bush: The
great debate

42:14.665 --> 42:19.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's been going on inside the
Republican
world since 2012 is, do we need
to change

42:19.837 --> 42:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pizza or do we need to
change the pizza
box?

42:21.973 --> 42:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA KLEIN, Editor in Chief,
Vox: The Republican
Party is riven by very real
disagreements

42:25.576 --> 42:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it doesn't actually have a
mechanism
for solving.

42:28.045 --> 42:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KRISTOL, Editor, The Weekly
Standard:
As a conservative, why would one
support Donald

42:31.349 --> 42:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump? There's just no evidence
of any history
of belief in conservative
principles, of commitment

42:35.987 --> 42:37.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to conservative causes.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DEMINT (R), Former U.S.
Senator: Whether
it's Trump or Cruz or several
others, if you

42:39.991 --> 42:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear someone say something, a
lot of us will
say, well, I wouldn't have said
that, but

42:43.194 --> 42:44.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm glad somebody said it.

42:44.962 --> 42:48.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC CANTOR (R-VA), Former House
Majority
Leader: Our party has taken an
anger detour

42:48.166 --> 42:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is evident every day when
we look at
the news and watch the polls.

42:51.836 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Frum, your
article in
"The Atlantic" is "The Great
Republican Revolt."

42:57.742 --> 43:02.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, boil it down for us. Who's
revolting,
against whom and why?

43:02.814 --> 43:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: The Republican Party
had planned
a dynastic succession for 2016.
One Bush would

43:08.386 --> 43:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
follow smoothly after another
Bush. Everything
was positioned for this Jeb Bush
succession.

43:15.226 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, instead, the Republican
Party got a class
war.

43:18.229 --> 43:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KRISTOL: When you look back
at 2012,
it's pretty amazing that the
Republican Party

43:21.699 --> 43:29.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nominated a very wealthy
Republican who had,
in Massachusetts, done a version
of Obamacare,

43:29.207 --> 43:35.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as their nominee, in a party
that hated Obamacare,
that was unhappy about
Republican elites,

43:35.446 --> 43:37.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well as Democratic elites.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: They believed Mitt
Romney was
going to win. And he didn't.
That was a big

43:39.550 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shock and surprise. The
Republican elite,
the donors, the members of
Congress, had collectively

43:44.155 --> 43:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done an analysis of what they
believed had
gone wrong in 2012.

43:48.359 --> 43:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing the party had
done wrong was,
it had not been open enough on
immigration.

43:53.197 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fix that, and everything would
fall into place.

43:55.299 --> 43:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA KLEIN: That was the theory.
That was
a plan. And that's why you begin
by having,

43:59.470 --> 44:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right after the 2012 election, a
very serious
effort, including many top
Republicans, like

44:04.108 --> 44:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio, John McCain, to
push immigration
reform.

44:08.446 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, that dies in the
House, because
rank-and-file Republicans and
conservatives

44:13.451 --> 44:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on talk radio actually didn't
want immigration
reform.

44:16.187 --> 44:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ezra Klein,
you're the editor
in chief of the news and
analysis Web site

44:20.725 --> 44:21.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vox.

44:22.026 --> 44:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is immigration the chief issue
you see dividing
the party?

44:26.097 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA KLEIN: I think a lot of
these issues,
trade, immigration, they have a
real subtext

44:32.470 --> 44:34.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of economic insecurity.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're in a place right now as a
country where
the demographic changes that
we're going through

44:38.109 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are significant and they are
fast, not just
with immigration, but with
relative birth

44:42.847 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rates and other things in recent
years. So
we're just about to hit the
point where a

44:46.784 --> 44:49.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority of infants are
minority.

44:49.287 --> 44:55.493 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
We're sort of a
majority-minority nation if
you're under 3 years old. That
is a profound

44:55.593 --> 45:00.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
change for people to live
through. And I think
it's a change that the political
system doesn't

45:00.364 --> 45:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really know how to talk about or
doesn't -- and,
for that matter, frankly doesn't
want to talk

45:04.168 --> 45:05.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

45:06.003 --> 45:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: When you ask the
question, do
you think you will be better off
in 10 years

45:08.372 --> 45:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than you are today, do you think
your children
will have a better life than
you, the most

45:12.543 --> 45:17.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pessimistic group in America are
whites without
a college degree. And the second
most pessimistic

45:17.915 --> 45:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group in America are whites with
a college
degree.

45:20.418 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, into this
situation steps
New York billionaire Donald
Trump. What happens?

45:27.725 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: Donald Trump is one
of America's
great marketing geniuses. And
Trump has, as

45:34.966 --> 45:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great marketers do, an intuitive
understanding
of what the customer wants.

45:39.437 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he saw this opportunity. In
the spring
of 2015, if you asked
Republicans, you gave

45:46.877 --> 45:50.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them a straight binary choice,
what do you
want to do with illegal
immigrants, do you

45:50.414 --> 45:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to somehow legalize them,
or do you want
to deport them, you made the
choice that stark,

45:55.386 --> 45:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what you saw was a majority,
more Republicans
said deport than legalize.

45:59.056 --> 46:02.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the great marketer came
along and said,
I see a niche. I see a niche.
And it's the

46:02.994 --> 46:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bigger niche. And I can have it
all to myself.

46:05.429 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bill Kristol,
you're the editor
of The Weekly Standard, a
longtime leading

46:10.101 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voice among the neoconservatives
in this country.

46:14.171 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have said that if the
Republicans nominate
Donald Trump for president,
you're ready to

46:20.811 --> 46:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support a third party. Is that
still your
position?

46:23.814 --> 46:27.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KRISTOL: It is. I suppose I
should leave
the door a little bit open,
because who knows

46:27.852 --> 46:31.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the world would look like
in June or
July if that were to happen,
what Trump would

46:31.155 --> 46:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have said, what positions he
would have taken.

46:33.090 --> 46:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day,
could you trust
him to appoint constitutional
Supreme Court

46:36.794 --> 46:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judges? Could you trust him to
be serious
about limiting the scope of
government? Trump

46:41.632 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just seems to have no interest
in any of that.

46:43.701 --> 46:47.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA KLEIN: Trump, unlike a lot
of Republicans,
says he's going to protect
Medicare, protect

46:47.738 --> 46:52.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Social Security, that he
believes in the government.
He's not here to cut your
government programs.

46:52.910 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he's here to do is make
sure the government
is helping you, the downscale,
economically

46:57.048 --> 46:58.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
struggling white voter.

46:58.883 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this money's not going to be
going to
immigrants who are flooding
across a border

47:01.986 --> 47:06.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to take advantage of our
generosity. And that,
for a particular part of the
party, is very

47:06.657 --> 47:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appealing. And for other parts
of the party,
it's really noxious.

47:09.860 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: Even now, about
two-thirds of
Republicans find Trump
unacceptable. He is

47:15.733 --> 47:19.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unpopular with the more
affluent, the more
educated and the more religious
within the

47:19.770 --> 47:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party. And those are
the people
who usually do tend to prevail
in Republican

47:23.808 --> 47:25.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
contests.

47:25.643 --> 47:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KRISTOL: A lot of the
conventional view
is -- just lumps Cruz and Trump
together.

47:28.312 --> 47:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Cruz and Trump are
very different.
And it's not an accident that
they're now

47:31.949 --> 47:33.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fighting a big war.

47:33.851 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz, people can like him,
dislike him. At
the end of the day, Cruz clerked
for the chief

47:37.054 --> 47:41.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice of the United States.
Cruz has argued
many cases in the Supreme Court.
Cruz wants

47:41.525 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very conservative form of
limited government,
constitutionalism and so forth.
And that's

47:47.164 --> 47:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really what his -- the agenda
he's believed
in for 20 years is all about.

47:50.935 --> 47:52.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very different from Trump.

47:52.737 --> 47:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what happens
to the Tea
Party in all this? We don't hear
about the

47:55.039 --> 47:56.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tea Party, per se.

47:57.007 --> 48:00.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KRISTOL: I think Trump has
done a pretty
good job of hijacking, in a way,
the Tea Party

48:00.745 --> 48:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impetus, and, in my view, in an
unhealthy
way.

48:02.913 --> 48:07.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is, I think the Tea Party
believed in
constitutional government. It
was trying to

48:07.118 --> 48:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
re-limit government. It was --
it hated Obamacare.
It didn't like the bailouts
there are good

48:10.821 --> 48:12.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reasons not to like.

48:12.790 --> 48:16.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim DeMint,
you're the former
senator from South Carolina.
You're the president

48:16.694 --> 48:21.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Heritage Foundation. Some
call you
the godfather of the Tea Party
movement.

48:21.632 --> 48:22.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:22.166 --> 48:23.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JIM DEMINT: OK.

48:23.267 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did you get
that designation?

48:25.136 --> 48:28.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DEMINT: I finally saw we
weren't going
to change the system with the
same people

48:28.405 --> 48:30.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who were there.

48:30.274 --> 48:35.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I went out across the
country and began
to try to help primary opponents
to Republican

48:35.346 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment candidates. And
the country
rose up in 2010, put a lot of
new people in

48:42.319 --> 48:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the House and the Senate. And
there were a
lot of complaints by the
establishment.

48:46.357 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eric Cantor, it
was 2014. You
were the majority leader of the
House, presumed

48:51.228 --> 48:58.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the next speaker of the
House of Representatives.
You lost a primary battle to an
unknown economics

48:58.903 --> 49:01.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professor, Dave Brat, a member
of the Tea
Party.

49:01.438 --> 49:05.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, with the passage of time,
do you better
understand what happened?

49:05.943 --> 49:10.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC CANTOR: Certainly, there
were a lot of
factors at work. And I do think,
though, very

49:10.714 --> 49:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much, if you look at what is
going on today,
was a real anger out there on
the part of

49:14.919 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot of people.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
is the source
of the anger?

49:18.055 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC CANTOR: That real anger out
there in
the grassroots, when people
would go home

49:22.560 --> 49:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there would be layoffs, and
wage-earners
in their 40s and 50s who say,
hey, wait a

49:27.932 --> 49:32.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minute, what happened to my job,
and then
didn't have the skills to go
find another

49:32.169 --> 49:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job, members of Congress going
home and seeing
that, and saying, hey,
something's broken.

49:37.441 --> 49:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then that again compounds
itself, which
leads some people to say, hey,
wait a minute,

49:43.747 --> 49:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we got to throw it all out and
go to the extreme,
because we are in that bad of a
situation.

49:49.753 --> 49:55.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DEMINT: In 2010, this wave
of Tea Party
sent a whole new group to
Washington. Nothing

49:55.759 --> 50:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened. 2012, the Republican
Party took
back -- they pushed the Tea
Party out. They

50:01.465 --> 50:07.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to run the presidential
race with Karl
Rove and other top-down
approach. And it was

50:07.371 --> 50:09.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a disaster.

50:09.273 --> 50:13.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in 2014, the candidates
were back out
there for the Senate and the
House campaigning

50:13.310 --> 50:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, OK, we're going to do it
this time. Give
us a majority in the Senate.
Nothing happened

50:18.182 --> 50:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after they got the majority.

50:20.017 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you see now is
people basically
saying, the heck with these
guys. It doesn't

50:24.622 --> 50:27.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
matter what they promise.
They're not going
to do anything.

50:27.157 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You had what
happened to Eric
Cantor in 2014.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM DEMINT: Right.

50:31.562 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, last
year, the downfall
of -- or the resignation of
Speaker Boehner.

50:37.101 --> 50:39.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's been going on in the
House of Representatives?

50:39.136 --> 50:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DEMINT: John Boehner, who we
used to be
friends, but he saw
conservatives and this

50:44.742 --> 50:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of limited government as
more of an obstacle
and a frustration. And he
punished conservatives

50:52.116 --> 50:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who really tried to push for
some fairly simple
things.

50:56.420 --> 51:01.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What John Boehner found is, he
couldn't crush
the conservatives, but he -- but
he made it

51:01.892 --> 51:03.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
painful for them.

51:03.694 --> 51:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC CANTOR: When you hear
people say, hey,
you aren't trying hard enough,
you didn't

51:06.797 --> 51:11.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shut the government down, you
didn't allow
the government to go into
default, I mean,

51:11.101 --> 51:16.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these are all things that, to
me, so counterintuitive.
I mean, nobody understands what
that would

51:16.273 --> 51:20.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really mean if you went into
default, and
all the people that could
potentially get

51:20.911 --> 51:22.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurt.

51:22.746 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People will say, yes, things are
that bad,
go ahead, and just blow it all
up, so we can

51:25.649 --> 51:27.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reconstitute it.

51:27.484 --> 51:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA KLEIN: This is part of the
problem for
the Republican Party, and
particularly for

51:29.453 --> 51:36.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican base. They will
run elections
based on these promises of deep
confrontation

51:36.560 --> 51:38.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and tremendous results.

51:38.429 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, once in office, they
can't deliver
on that much, because the
American system

51:42.733 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of government requires a lot of
compromise
and a lot of consensus for
anything to get

51:47.504 --> 51:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done. That leads to a cycle of
disillusionment
within the Republican base,
because they feel

51:51.909 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they voted for these
politicians. These politicians
made clear promises. They didn't
deliver on

51:56.680 --> 51:58.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the promises.

51:58.615 --> 52:02.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one thing that has become, I
think, really
toxic is the way the base tends
to interpret

52:02.720 --> 52:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that disappointment, is that the
real issue
is that the politicians went and
got bought

52:09.026 --> 52:10.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Washington.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do moderates have
a place in
the Republican Party?

52:12.629 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRUM: The most important
kind of moderation
that's needed is Republicans
need to preach

52:17.267 --> 52:21.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respect for the work and the
institutions
of government. The government
has to be made

52:21.739 --> 52:23.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to work.

52:23.574 --> 52:26.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government is -- I think all
Republicans
agree, is too expensive. But
that doesn't

52:26.910 --> 52:30.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean that we'd be better off
without one,
or that you want to destroy the
traditional

52:31.015 --> 52:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreements and understandings
that make the
American government work.

52:34.718 --> 52:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans have really stressed
those since
2009, and that's been dangerous.
So, we have

52:39.590 --> 52:45.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to rediscover some respect for
the institutions
of government, and also accept
that, in a

52:45.829 --> 52:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democracy, you don't get all --
your way all
the time. And it's not a failure
of the system

52:51.235 --> 53:02.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if you do not win every
particular argument.
