JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
Humorist David Sedaris plumbs
his own diaries for his latest

00:06.466 --> 00:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
book showcasing
life's idiosyncrasies.

00:08.766 --> 00:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with
Sedaris recently, amidst his
performing around the country in

00:14.366 --> 00:16.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some 120 cities.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A 60-year-old
hugely successful writer looking
back at his younger self, the

00:23.900 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one before the millions of
books sold, the countless live
appearances before adoring

00:30.800 --> 00:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
audiences and often, in
his culottes, the regular
appearances on late-night TV.

00:37.700 --> 00:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a recent morning, we joined
David Sedaris at the archives
of La MaMa Theatre in Lower

00:44.366 --> 00:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Manhattan, one of the
small stages where he
first told stories.

00:47.766 --> 00:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a new book titled "Theft By
Finding,Â®MD-B" Sedaris offers
a kind of fractured portrait

00:54.400 --> 00:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the artist behind
the stories, through
his personal diaries.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS, Author, "Theft
by Finding": Trying this
persona on and that persona on

01:00.366 --> 01:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, you know, trying acting,
and oh, now look, I'm trying
sculpture, and now, all the

01:07.900 --> 01:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sudden, I'm a painter. But
that you could kind of settle
on being yourself, completely

01:14.833 --> 01:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yourself, and have that be
the thing that works, is being
yourself, is, to me, incredible.

01:22.100 --> 01:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sedaris
was raised in a large
family in Raleigh,
North Carolina, and many

01:29.566 --> 01:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his stories involve
his parents and siblings,
including sister Amy,
a well-known humorist

01:33.533 --> 01:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in her own right.

01:35.966 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His colorfully titled story
collections, including
"Me Talk Pretty One
Day," "Dress Your Family

01:41.833 --> 01:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Corduroy and Denim,"
and "Let's Explore
Diabetes With Owls," are
perennial bestsellers.

01:47.566 --> 01:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And NPR regularly replays
perhaps his most famous story,
"SantaLand Diaries," about the

01:53.533 --> 01:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time he worked as
an elf at Macy's.

01:55.533 --> 02:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Twenty-two
thousand people came to see
Santa today, and not all of them

02:00.233 --> 02:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were well-behaved.
Today, I witnessed
fistfights and vomiting
and magnificent tantrums.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That experience
appears in his diaries
beginning on October 31, 1990,

02:12.300 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he is told:
"Congratulations, Mr.
Sedaris. You are an elf."

02:15.700 --> 02:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you can't not
write and keep a diary?

02:18.833 --> 02:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, it's funny,
because, sometimes, people
would say, oh, that's very

02:22.533 --> 02:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disciplined. But it's not a
discipline. It is a compulsion.

02:25.700 --> 02:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should be out doing things,
but I have to write about these
people I saw at dinner the

02:32.700 --> 02:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night before. I have to write
about the bellman at my hotel.
I have to write about something

02:38.600 --> 02:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that ultimately doesn't matter
at all. But I -- I don't
know. I can't move on until I

02:44.033 --> 02:45.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get that down.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you
overhear something or you record
something in your diary, is

02:49.400 --> 02:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there kind of, aha, this
is something I can use?

02:53.233 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: I flew here
from London. I was at Newark
Airport waiting for someone

02:57.000 --> 02:59.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pick me up.

02:59.066 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I saw a couple, and they
were in their mid-60s. And
then she said to him, where's

03:03.400 --> 03:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other suitcase? And he
said, what other suitcase? She
said, you left home dragging

03:10.400 --> 03:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two suitcases behind you. Now
you have got one. The other one
is mine. Where's my suitcase?

03:15.066 --> 03:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You lost my suitcase.

03:17.100 --> 03:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought, wow. I mean, I have
been in a similar situation,
right? And just the entire look

03:24.333 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on her face, like, if I could
leave you now, or if I could
kill you now, I would do it.

03:31.333 --> 03:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I had to write about
that. Maybe one day, I would
write a story about arguing in

03:40.133 --> 03:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public, and those would
come in handy in some way.

03:47.166 --> 03:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also, like, if I were
going to remember yesterday,
I flew here in an airplane and

03:54.966 --> 03:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did this and that. But that
was really the moment yesterday
where I felt like I was living

04:02.800 --> 04:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my life, like I was in the
moment. I wasn't thinking about
the past or about the future.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was just right there living,
visiting and listening, watching
those people have an argument.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that sense
is important to you somehow?

04:20.033 --> 04:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, because I
spend so much time like living
in the past or the future.

04:27.033 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think most people
do, really. And the moments
when you're really present in

04:32.933 --> 04:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your life can be
pretty rare, really.

04:36.066 --> 04:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sedaris'
stories appear regularly
in "The New Yorker." On
the day we got together,

04:42.500 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was just finishing a new one.

04:44.566 --> 04:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the printed stories and
on stage, you're presenting, in
some sense, a character named

04:52.533 --> 04:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, David Sedaris,
right? Your family members,
your partner, Hugh.
Talking to you now, I'm

04:59.433 --> 05:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not sure if you think of
them as characters or you're
just writing yourself.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, I think
people are people in real life,
but the second you put them

05:08.100 --> 05:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on page -- on the page,
they become characters.

05:10.366 --> 05:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how
worked over are your stories?

05:13.233 --> 05:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Gosh, the story
that -- I sent in a draft this
morning for this "New Yorker"

05:20.466 --> 05:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story that we're closing,
and it's the 21st draft.

05:21.766 --> 05:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Twenty-first draft?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: Mm-hmm.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it tinkering
over words or jokes or...

05:27.600 --> 05:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: It's tinkering
over words. I will go on tour
with, like, let's say three

05:31.933 --> 05:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new stories, and I will read
them and go back to the room
and rewrite them, and read them

05:35.533 --> 05:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and rewrite them.

05:37.566 --> 05:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what does
a story in the end have to
have to be successful, to work

05:41.466 --> 05:43.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you?

05:43.600 --> 05:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: It used
to be about just racking
up laughs, right? But
I think you need, like,

05:49.733 --> 05:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some sorrow to give the laughter
a bit of weight. And that's
when you remember things.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.133 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Or that's when I
remember things.

05:59.133 --> 06:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So people come
and they want - - you think
they want laughter, but you want

06:05.233 --> 06:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
something more. You want
to give them something
more. What is that more?

06:08.466 --> 06:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: I want to
connect with them. I want them
to -- usually, it's the worst

06:15.466 --> 06:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing you can admit about
yourself that most people
can relate to. Right?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was so surprising to me when
I realized that, that when I
thought, well, if you write

06:26.766 --> 06:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, say, your own jealousy,
people aren't going to think,
oh, he's a horrible person

06:33.166 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he's jealous. They
will think, that's me.

06:36.733 --> 06:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was there
always an ambition? Was there
always a kind of craving to not

06:42.900 --> 06:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only get to a bigger
world, but reach people?

06:46.500 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Yes. It's
all I ever wanted. It's
all I ever thought about.

06:53.533 --> 06:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I go on tour and I'm on
stage and the lights come up
at the end and I see those

06:56.800 --> 07:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, people say, oh, that
must be awful. You go on tour
and you go to 40 cities in

07:03.766 --> 07:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
41 days. And then you have
the book signing. And that's
people standing in line to say

07:10.433 --> 07:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how much they love you.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
for hours sometimes.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: And I
don't see any part of
that that's negative.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:17.166 --> 07:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: It's all
I ever dreamed about
like from age to 6 up.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Sedaris
will continue to tell his
stories and write his diaries

07:28.033 --> 07:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in his travels at home
and abroad this summer.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in New York.
