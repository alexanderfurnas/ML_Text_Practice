WEBVTT

00:07.107 --> 00:21.288
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
the recent wave of attacks in
the Middle East.

00:21.288 --> 00:26.226
Earlier today, the Islamic State
group posted a video calling on
Palestinians to attack

00:26.226 --> 00:29.162
Israeli soldiers and civilians.
Meanwhile, on the ground,
tensions remain high after

00:29.162 --> 00:31.832
a weekend of more deaths.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.301
Special correspondent Martin
Seemungal from Jerusalem.

00:34.301 --> 00:40.674
And a warning: This story
contains graphic images.

00:40.674 --> 00:49.716
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Israelis woke
up this morning to another
barrage of violence in the news,

00:49.716 --> 00:56.490
a terror attack the night
before, this time at a bus
station in the southern town of
Beersheba.

00:56.490 --> 01:12.139
An Israeli Arab veteran armed
with a pistol shot and killed an
Israeli soldier, then grabbed

01:12.139 --> 01:17.377
his assault rifle and opened
fire, injuring several people in
the station, before being

01:17.377 --> 01:21.181
shot and killed himself.

01:21.181 --> 01:28.956
MICKY ROSENFELD, Israeli Police
Spokesman: We have six people
that were injured, four

01:28.956 --> 01:36.129
of them being police officers
injured inside the Central Bus
Station.

01:36.129 --> 01:41.034
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: A security
guard at the station also shot
this man, thinking he was

01:41.034 --> 01:49.943
a terrorist. An angry mob
attacked him while he was on the
ground. He turned out to be

01:49.943 --> 01:53.480
innocent, an Eritrean asylum
seeker, 29-year old Haftom
Zarhum.

01:53.480 --> 02:01.254
That fury is driven by a deep
and growing fear among Israelis.
In East Jerusalem, the

02:01.254 --> 02:05.892
epicenter of the recent wave of
terror, police and army
continued to escalate their
security

02:05.892 --> 02:10.397
presence, setting up roadblocks
at the exit points of several
Arab areas.

02:10.397 --> 02:14.468
Jabel Mukaber is the most
extreme example of Israel's
determination to fight this
recent

02:14.468 --> 02:18.672
wave of terror. There are army
checkpoints all around and they
are in the process of

02:18.672 --> 02:19.740
building a wall to separate the
Arab village from the Jewish
neighborhoods on the other

02:19.740 --> 02:21.508
side.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.578
The Palestinians view the
operation as a form of
collective punishment.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.715
Thaer Oraga says it only
makes people here angry.

02:28.715 --> 02:32.119
THAER ORAGA, Palestinian: All
the people make attack from
Jabel Mukaber? I am guilty? I

02:32.119 --> 02:34.921
am guilty of the attacks? No.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.924
MAN: I don't think so, not at
all. This doesn't prevent
attacks. This just leads to
extremism,

02:37.924 --> 02:41.194
I think. It doesn't
lead to peace.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.865
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The Jewish
town is called Armon HaNetziv.
David Dahan says the wall

02:44.865 --> 02:46.633
and the extra security
is necessary.

02:46.633 --> 02:51.338
DAVID DAHAN, Israel: Whatever
they need to do, they should do.
You know, if it's to check

02:51.338 --> 02:55.242
them every morning, it's
something that should be done.
It's not optimal to live when
you

02:55.242 --> 02:57.811
are checked every day, but if
it's good for the security, they
should do so.

02:57.811 --> 03:01.681
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The fiery
attack recently on Joseph's Tomb
near Nablus also inflamed

03:01.681 --> 03:04.951
tensions. Some of the young
Palestinians who carried out the
attack were arrested by
Palestinian

03:04.951 --> 03:07.087
security forces.

03:07.087 --> 03:12.092
But Nabil Shaath, a senior
member of the ruling Fatah Party
in the West Bank, says it is
becoming

03:12.092 --> 03:14.494
increasingly difficult to
control young Palestinians
there.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.931
NABIL SHAATH, Former Palestinian
Foreign Minister: What can you
do? If the occupier doesn't take

03:17.931 --> 03:19.933
the first step, there is no way
you can stop it. I am telling
you this with alarm, with

03:19.933 --> 03:21.468
grief.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.671
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Palestinian
anger is fueled by a belief that
Israel intends to change

03:24.671 --> 03:31.878
the status quo involving the
Al-Aqsa Mosque located in the
area Muslims call the Noble

03:31.878 --> 03:36.116
Sanctuary. Jews call it the
Temple Mount. Jews can visit the
Temple Mount, but by agreement

03:36.116 --> 03:38.518
cannot pray there.

03:38.518 --> 03:42.389
Reported attempts by right-wing
Jews to pray have triggered
clashes. Israel's prime minister

03:42.389 --> 03:47.060
has asked Jewish leaders not to
visit while tensions are high.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.232
Dore Gold is the director
general of Israel's Foreign
Ministry with close ties to
Netanyahu.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.336
DORE GOLD, Former Israeli
Ambassador to the United
Nations: We are not taking
measures

03:56.336 --> 04:00.774
against the Al-Aqsa Mosque. That
is a total lie that is extremely
dangerous.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.477
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The gulf
between the Palestinian
Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas,
and Netanyahu's

04:03.477 --> 04:05.712
government grows
wider every day.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.583
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry is now stepping in.

04:09.583 --> 04:17.491
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: You have to sit down and
talk to each other in order

04:17.491 --> 04:22.729
to explore those kinds of
possibilities. So, I don't enter
this discussion with a specific

04:22.729 --> 04:27.334
expectation, except to try to
understand better for all of us.

04:27.334 --> 04:32.539
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Kerry is
expected to meet Netanyahu in
Germany on Thursday, and Abbas

04:32.539 --> 04:34.174
in Jordan over the weekend.

04:34.174 --> 04:37.277
Reporting from Jerusalem, I'm
Martin Seemungal for the "PBS
NewsHour."

04:37.277 --> 04:42.749
GWEN IFILL: It's the week of
the: Will he or won't he? Will
Vice President Joe Biden

04:42.749 --> 04:48.555
run? Will Republican Paul Ryan
enter the fray to be speaker of
the House?

04:48.555 --> 04:52.726
To discuss all that and more, we
turn to Politics Monday, Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter

04:52.726 --> 04:54.494
of The Cook Political Report.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.264
So, I'm going to put it all in
front of you here. Start of Joe
Biden. What do we know?

04:57.264 --> 05:00.167
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I don't think that
anybody knows anything, and
that's

05:00.167 --> 05:00.400
the reality.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.268
GWEN IFILL: OK.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.570
AMY WALTER: OK?

05:03.570 --> 05:08.975
I think, if I could just boil it
down to the way I'm looking at
both of these, is, one

05:08.975 --> 05:13.346
I think is much more
consequential than the other.
And that is Paul Ryan's
decision, a

05:13.346 --> 05:17.817
go or no-go. And what I am
hearing more and more of is a
pessimism among Republicans,

05:17.817 --> 05:23.823
that they don't think he is
going to do this job. It's a
thankless job. And they don't

05:23.823 --> 05:26.960
think he is going to be able to
get the entire Republican
Conference around him to support

05:26.960 --> 05:28.828
him.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.732
What does this mean? This means
that the Republican Conference
is now officially ungovernable,

05:32.732 --> 05:37.671
that there is a risk now that it
may not ever be able to be
fixed, that we have two big

05:37.671 --> 05:41.474
deadlines coming up very soon,
the debt ceiling, highway
transportation bill, real stuff,
real

05:41.474 --> 05:44.778
big, consequential stuff, with a
Republican Conference in the
House that nobody can lead.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.882
GWEN IFILL: Interestingly
enough, in the Hillary camp,
which you cover, Tamara, there
has been

05:48.882 --> 05:54.421
more and more of those, Joe
Biden has got to make up his
mind, Joe Biden has got to

05:54.421 --> 05:58.725
-- he should make up his mind.
Are they nervous or are they
just assuming that they know the

05:58.725 --> 06:03.029
answer and they just want
him to get on with it?

06:03.029 --> 06:06.600
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Last I checked, I don't
think they think they know

06:06.600 --> 06:08.802
the answer either.

06:08.802 --> 06:14.374
This is just one of those things
where, this has been dragging on
for months now. We have

06:14.374 --> 06:23.049
had heightened Joe Biden
awareness back in August. And
now we're in this new flurry of

06:23.049 --> 06:29.389
leaks and non-leaks and people
close to Joe Biden say yes and
people close to Joe Biden

06:29.389 --> 06:32.859
say no. And off the record,
people say it's all wrong.

06:32.859 --> 06:36.263
This is just -- I think a lot of
people, including people in the
Clinton campaign, would just

06:36.263 --> 06:38.932
like the wondering to be done.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.634
GWEN IFILL: One
way or the other.

06:40.634 --> 06:44.437
AMY WALTER: One
way or the other.

06:44.437 --> 06:49.809
GWEN IFILL: I agree with that.
It would be nice not to talk
about this one more week.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.611
AMY WALTER: The hardest thing, I
think, for her is that it is
probably having an impact

06:51.611 --> 06:53.380
on fund-raising.

06:53.380 --> 06:58.118
There are a bunch of people
sitting on their checkbooks
saying, listen, I'm not going to

06:58.118 --> 07:02.756
write a check until I know
what Biden is actually doing.

07:02.756 --> 07:07.994
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about other things having an
impact on the campaign.

07:07.994 --> 07:13.800
We're expecting on Thursday for
Hillary Clinton to finally
testify in front of the Benghazi

07:13.800 --> 07:21.074
Committee. There has been quite
a dust-up in the days leading up
to that between the

07:21.074 --> 07:23.143
committee chairman, the ranking
Democrat, basically disagreeing
about what the purpose

07:23.143 --> 07:26.446
of this is. And Hillary Clinton
is happy to jump on board.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.948
AMY WALTER: Yes.

07:28.948 --> 07:35.722
For the first time in a long
time, Hillary Clinton is now on
the offense. When this first

07:35.722 --> 07:41.027
came up, we thought, OK, this is
going to be a very tough day for
Hillary Clinton. We're

07:41.027 --> 07:48.635
going to talk a lot about
e-mail. She is going to be put
on the defensive. Republicans
now

07:48.635 --> 07:58.078
are going to be able to get at
her in a way that they haven't
before.

07:58.078 --> 08:03.750
And now it's been turned
completely around, that it's
Republicans now on the
defensive.

08:03.750 --> 08:12.659
GWEN IFILL: One of the things I
noticed, that put out like a
five-minute video today in

08:12.659 --> 08:15.261
which she touted her time as
secretary of state, what an
effective secretary of state

08:15.261 --> 08:17.864
she was. We're watching a
little bit of it here.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.934
Is that part of the
offense, Tamara?

08:20.934 --> 08:24.003
TAMARA KEITH: I think she goes
in there and she acts like
secretary of state. She is the

08:24.003 --> 08:26.606
stateswoman. She has to be very
careful in that hearing not to
come off as dismissive,

08:26.606 --> 08:29.709
even though she thinks that
it is a partisan witch-hunt.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.045
She has to come in there and
take it very seriously. And the
challenge for her is, this

08:32.045 --> 08:33.747
could be six or eight hours'
long. You think that Republican
debate at three hours was

08:33.747 --> 08:34.614
a long time?

08:34.614 --> 08:37.050
GWEN IFILL: Wow.

08:37.050 --> 08:41.721
TAMARA KEITH: Try a daylong
hearing, multiple rounds of
questioning, on a whole range of

08:41.721 --> 08:45.859
areas, not just the Benghazi
attack. It is going -- it's
going to be a marathon. And,

08:45.859 --> 08:50.597
by the end of the day, she, like
any other human being, is likely
to be tired. And the

08:50.597 --> 08:53.900
pressure is still going to be
on her to be statesmanlike.

08:53.900 --> 08:58.104
GWEN IFILL: Two more
things I want to get to.

08:58.104 --> 09:02.375
One is the latest dust-up
between Donald Trump and Jeb
Bush about who was responsible
for

09:02.375 --> 09:05.245
9/11, whether he was blaming
Jeb Bush's brother George W.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.415
What is that about? What
is driving that dispute?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.250
AMY WALTER: What is driving that
is Donald Trump. Donald Trump's
campaign is all about

09:10.250 --> 09:12.085
his ability to get
media attention.

09:12.085 --> 09:16.823
And the way he gets media
attention is, he says something
dramatic or he attacks somebody.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.927
The media covers it. Then the
media asks his opponent to
respond to it. And that person

09:20.927 --> 09:22.595
respond. And then we
go back and around.

09:22.595 --> 09:22.829
(CROSSTALK)

09:22.829 --> 09:24.964
GWEN IFILL: Ah.

09:24.964 --> 09:29.068
AMY WALTER: And guess who wins
on that? Donald Trump, every
single time.

09:29.068 --> 09:34.707
And that's why I think Jeb Bush
jumping into this, both over
Twitter and then in the media,

09:34.707 --> 09:37.010
is a mistake. If you are on
Donald Trump's territory, you
are going to lose. If you are

09:37.010 --> 09:38.678
fighting your campaign on your
territory, you are more likely
to win that fight.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.981
GWEN IFILL: One more thing.

09:41.981 --> 09:47.987
So, Saturday nation, we saw --
we wait for "Saturday Night
Live" during a campaign season

09:47.987 --> 09:54.661
just to see what they are going
to do with the people we cover
every day. And this was

09:54.661 --> 09:56.796
what they did with
Bernie Sanders.

09:56.796 --> 09:57.831
LARRY DAVID, Actor:
We're doomed.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.732
(LAUGHTER)

09:59.732 --> 10:04.237
LARRY DAVID: We need a
revolution, millions of people
on the streets. And we got to do

10:04.237 --> 10:04.571
something!

10:04.571 --> 10:05.705
(LAUGHTER)

10:05.705 --> 10:07.640
LARRY DAVID: And we
got to do it now.

10:07.640 --> 10:07.907
(LAUGHTER)

10:07.907 --> 10:08.441
LARRY DAVID: Ehh.

10:08.441 --> 10:08.808
GWEN IFILL: Ehh.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.677
(LAUGHTER)

10:10.677 --> 10:13.613
GWEN IFILL: That's Larry David
from "Curb Your Enthusiasm"
doing a spot-on Bernie Sanders.

10:13.613 --> 10:19.719
AMY WALTER: I think we need him
to be on the trail now 24/7. In
fact, if we could get Larry

10:19.719 --> 10:25.458
David and Tina Fey as Sarah
Palin, put them on the road, I
think that would be a big hit.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.827
TAMARA KEITH: It would sell a
lot of tickets. It would be
huge.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.330
GWEN IFILL: It would be huge.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.067
Bernie Sanders himself, who did
reasonably well at this debate.
Even though Hillary Clinton

10:34.067 --> 10:39.072
did well, he also didn't do
poorly for himself. He benefits
from getting the opportunity to

10:39.072 --> 10:44.811
show off his sense of humor,
because he seems like a really
cranky guy sometimes.

10:44.811 --> 10:54.254
AMY WALTER: Well, and what he
highlighted, Larry David did, in
this 'Saturday Night Live"

10:54.254 --> 11:03.630
skit, was his ability, Bernie
Sanders' ability to win over
younger voters. Right?

11:03.630 --> 11:13.373
Here is this guy who is in his
70s. And he has the Larry David
mannerisms and all of

11:13.373 --> 11:17.043
this. And yet it's young people
who are attracted to him.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.212
GWEN IFILL: Right.

11:19.212 --> 11:23.516
AMY WALTER: He's like, get off
my lawn, but don't you love me?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.417
(LAUGHTER)

11:24.417 --> 11:26.920
GWEN IFILL: Well, a
lot of people to.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.955
AMY WALTER: Exactly.

11:28.955 --> 11:32.392
GWEN IFILL: And that is what
Hillary Clinton is also worried
about.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.359
Tamara Keith.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.528
Amy Walter, happy
birthday to you.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.630
AMY WALTER: Thank you very much.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.833
GWEN IFILL: Thank you all.

11:40.833 --> 11:46.439
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first,
hundreds of thousands of
Volkswagen and Audi owners have
been left

11:46.439 --> 11:51.477
in the dark about what to do
after learning their
diesel-fueled cars are emitting
up to

11:51.477 --> 11:56.115
40 times the amount of nitrogen
oxide allowed by the federal
government.

11:56.115 --> 12:01.220
Special correspondent Cat Wise
takes a look at the reaction in
Portland, Oregon. It is

12:01.220 --> 12:05.458
taking a lead role in a
multistate investigation of
Volkswagen, and has the most
affected vehicles,

12:05.458 --> 12:10.263
per capita, of any
state in the country.

12:10.263 --> 12:18.838
CAT WISE: Gourmet meats are
sizzling, and business is brisk
at the Lardo sandwich shop

12:18.838 --> 12:23.509
in one of Portland's hip new
neighborhoods. Owner Rick
Gencarelli is a true Portlander,

12:23.509 --> 12:28.314
carefully sourcing the food in
his restaurant and driving an
ecologically friendly car.

12:28.314 --> 12:33.886
At least, he thought he was
driving an ecologically friendly
car until last month. That's
when

12:33.886 --> 12:37.490
he and 500,000 other U.S. owners
of Volkswagen and Audi's
so-called clean diesel cars
learned

12:37.490 --> 12:39.525
they had been duped.

12:39.525 --> 12:43.763
RICK GENCARELLI, Owner, Lardo:
You're trying to make the right
decision for the environment,

12:43.763 --> 12:49.602
and then it turns out that its
30 or 40 times the allowed
amount of emissions, which is

12:49.602 --> 12:51.871
-- that's just completely
heartbreaking.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.942
CAT WISE: Gencarelli says he was
already starting to feel guilty
driving his 2011 Jetta TDI

12:55.942 --> 13:02.882
after the news broke. Then he
discovered a note left by an
anonymous person on the
windshield

13:02.882 --> 13:10.323
that read in part: "Your car is
currently polluting at rates
higher than nearly any

13:10.323 --> 13:16.596
modern gasoline car today, two
to four times more than a Chevy
Suburban, not to mention

13:16.596 --> 13:19.766
that V.W. lied to
you and the public.

13:19.766 --> 13:27.373
RICK GENCARELLI: I feel
horrible. Like, I want to just
wear a mask because I feel like

13:27.373 --> 13:34.113
I'm being judged so harshly. The
note kindly says that I should
consider a new car, but

13:34.113 --> 13:38.184
then what do I do with this one?
It's still going to be on the
road.

13:38.184 --> 13:45.491
CAT WISE: In fact, many V.W.
owners in Portland and around
the country are wondering what

13:45.491 --> 13:52.231
to do. Volkswagen has yet to
reveal plans for fixing the
emissions problems, and vehicle

13:52.231 --> 13:56.602
values are dropping amid the
uncertainty. Nationally, more
than 250 lawsuits have been

13:56.602 --> 14:01.674
filed against Volkswagen and
more are likely as states, car
dealers, and consumers grapple

14:01.674 --> 14:04.911
with the long-term implications
of the company's fraud.

14:04.911 --> 14:10.049
One of those filing suit is
Jamie Saul, a Portland
environmental law professor and
a

14:10.049 --> 14:14.287
dad in a busy household. Saul
and his wife, Alex, have been
big fans of the newer Volkswagen

14:14.287 --> 14:20.226
diesel vehicles. They have owned
two and convinced several family
members to buy them as well.

14:20.226 --> 14:24.764
But now Jamie is part of a
class-action lawsuit against the
company filed in a California

14:24.764 --> 14:26.966
federal court.

14:26.966 --> 14:32.872
We caught up with Jamie as he
was heading out for his morning
commute in his family's

14:32.872 --> 14:35.141
Jetta TDI SportWagen.

14:35.141 --> 14:41.681
So, tell me about that day that
you heard the news. What was
your reaction?

14:41.681 --> 14:47.887
JAMIE SAUL, Volkswagen Car
Owner: I was shocked. I was
shocked and disappointed at
Volkswagen.

14:47.887 --> 14:53.326
It's one of the few major
corporations that I thought was
really trying to do the right

14:53.326 --> 14:57.230
thing. There are a lot of
late-model TDIs in our
neighborhood and in Portland
generally,

14:57.230 --> 15:02.568
because I think consumers in
Portland like the idea of having
a fuel-efficient, clean

15:02.568 --> 15:04.537
car that's fun to drive and
practical for their family
needs.

15:04.537 --> 15:10.376
CAT WISE: Saul and his wife are
now trying to drive less, and
ride their bikes to work

15:10.376 --> 15:17.483
more often, but that's a big
hassle when they have to get the
kids around town. They'd like

15:17.483 --> 15:23.356
to sell the car, but who would
buy it and at what price?

15:23.356 --> 15:37.537
JAMIE SAUL: I think the people
who own these cars need to be
compensated for the lost value

15:37.537 --> 15:47.246
in the cars on the secondary
market. And they need a
real-world fix that solves the
problem,

15:47.246 --> 15:50.316
while not undermining the fuel
economy and the performance of
these cars.

15:50.316 --> 15:54.353
CAT WISE: While owners have been
struggling, Volkswagen
dealerships are also feeling the

15:54.353 --> 15:57.890
pain. The company has told
dealers to stop selling their
inventory of diesel vehicles,

15:57.890 --> 16:01.227
which typically account for
about 20 percent of sales.

16:01.227 --> 16:06.399
But Volkswagen is reportedly
reimbursing U.S. dealers for
expenses they incur during the

16:06.399 --> 16:10.136
scandal. We reached out to
Portland area Volkswagen
dealerships, but none would
agree to speak

16:10.136 --> 16:14.473
with us on camera. Nationwide,
sales of V.W.s are expected to
take a significant hit. But

16:14.473 --> 16:17.877
the emissions scandal isn't just
impacting new car dealers. It's
also having a big impact

16:17.877 --> 16:20.580
in the used car market.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.049
MONTY KING, President, Oregon
Vehicle Dealers Association: The
values are just dropping

16:23.049 --> 16:25.351
like a rock.

16:25.351 --> 16:29.322
CAT WISE: Monty King is
president of the Oregon Vehicle
Dealers Association and
represents

16:29.322 --> 16:31.958
used car and truck dealerships.

16:31.958 --> 16:37.063
MONTY KING: The dealers are very
concerned, because they're small
business people. And

16:37.063 --> 16:45.071
if they had bought one of these
V.W.s at the auction or even
taken it as a trade-in, and

16:45.071 --> 16:51.010
now because of this, the value
drops, say, $500 or 1,000,
they're going to take the loss.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.513
I think V.W. is
responsible for that.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.783
CAT WISE: King says independent
used car dealers aren't
expecting the same level of
support

16:57.783 --> 16:59.619
as V.W. dealerships.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.256
MONTY KING: There's 120,000 used
car dealers in the United
States. And if every one of

17:03.256 --> 17:05.491
them has one of these, what do
you think the chances are of
V.W. helping? I'm not real

17:05.491 --> 17:07.393
excited about that possibility.

17:07.393 --> 17:11.130
CAT WISE: One of the big
questions on many V.W. owners'
minds here in Portland is, can

17:11.130 --> 17:14.367
they still legally
drive their car?

17:14.367 --> 17:20.439
Oregon, like 29 other states,
has a vehicle emissions testing
program in several cities.

17:20.439 --> 17:24.877
The goal is to improve air
quality by making sure vehicles
are properly maintained and

17:24.877 --> 17:27.613
not emitting pollutants that
exhaust systems are designed to
catch.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.884
GERRY PRESTON, Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality: I know
it seems to be out there that

17:31.884 --> 17:35.821
vehicles, if you own these,
you're going to fail. And that's
just not the case.

17:35.821 --> 17:42.161
CAT WISE: Gerry Preston is in
charge of the vehicle inspection
program for Oregon's Department

17:42.161 --> 17:45.731
of Environmental Quality. He
says that impacted V.W. diesel
cars won't automatically fail

17:45.731 --> 17:47.800
the required biannual test. The
state is waiting for a recall to
happen, and then owners will

17:47.800 --> 17:50.369
be expected to get
those repairs made.

17:50.369 --> 17:55.741
GERRY PRESTON: We certainly care
about the issue, and we know
that nitrogen oxide, the

17:55.741 --> 18:00.613
component that we're talking
about, can cause problems with
asthma, emphysema, and
bronchitis,

18:00.613 --> 18:04.317
and things like that, so we're
very concerned about that.
However, we're letting EPA take

18:04.317 --> 18:10.289
the role, as are most states, to
let the recall process take its
form, and then after that,

18:10.289 --> 18:14.160
when they come back in, if they
haven't gotten the recall done,
then we will be looking at

18:14.160 --> 18:16.262
that.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.299
CAT WISE: For now, Jamie Saul
and many others are waiting for
news about that recall expected

18:20.299 --> 18:22.268
in the next few months.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.237
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Cat Wise in Portland, Oregon.

18:25.237 --> 18:29.475
GWEN IFILL: A lot of boys dream
of growing up, and girls too,
playing for the NBA.

18:29.475 --> 18:33.679
Caron Butler was one of the
lucky ones. He had the dream and
the skills to get him there.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.783
But he nearly threw it all away,
turning to a life of violence,
drug dealing and eventually

18:37.783 --> 18:39.518
prison.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.454
William Brangham has our latest
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf, Butler's "Tuff Juice:

18:41.454 --> 18:43.823
My Journey from the Streets
to the NBA." MD-Iö

18:43.823 --> 18:48.027
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To see him now
on the court, you would have
little sense of how far Caron

18:48.027 --> 18:50.663
Butler has come. This 14-year
veteran of the NBA Has played
with and for some of
basketball's

18:50.663 --> 18:53.032
greats. But this career
almost never happened.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.202
Growing up in a poor part of
Racine, Wisconsin, Butler
starting dealing cocaine at age
11,

18:56.202 --> 19:02.341
bought a gun at 12, and soon was
posing for pictures with stacks
of his drug money. In

19:02.341 --> 19:06.979
prison at 15, Butler vowed that,
when he got out, he would
change. He got a job at Burger

19:06.979 --> 19:09.515
King, and rededicated
himself to basketball.

19:09.515 --> 19:15.287
But 17 years ago, those plans
nearly fell apart. If it wasn't
for the snap judgment

19:15.287 --> 19:18.324
of this man, Detective Rick
Geller, Caron Butler might have
gone right back to prison

19:18.324 --> 19:19.892
and his career would
have never happened.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.662
I talked with them both
recently in our studio.

19:23.662 --> 19:28.034
Rick Geller, Caron Butler,
thanks for being here.

19:28.034 --> 19:32.171
CARON BUTLER, Author, "Tuff
Juice: My Journey from the
Streets to the NBA": Thanks for
having

19:32.171 --> 19:34.140
us.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.410
SGT. RICK GELLER (RET.), Racine,
Wisconsin, Police Department:
Thanks for having us.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.046
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Take me back
17 years ago to the day you guys
first met. Tell me that

19:40.046 --> 19:41.814
story.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.551
SGT. RICK GELLER: I had drafted
a search warrant for the Bluff
Avenue House that Caron was

19:45.551 --> 19:49.822
living at, at that time. Caron
had a criminal history, a very
lengthy criminal history.

19:49.822 --> 19:54.026
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you
thought you were going to break
into this House, and you're

19:54.026 --> 19:55.995
going to bust a drug dealer?

19:55.995 --> 19:58.831
SGT. RICK GELLER: That's
exactly what I thought.

19:58.831 --> 20:02.301
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And
what did you find?

20:02.301 --> 20:07.706
SGT. RICK GELLER: We ended up
finding 15.3 grams of crack
cocaine in the garage area.

20:07.706 --> 20:12.478
There was a lot of incidentals
that just didn't make sense to
me. Like, for instance, I had

20:12.478 --> 20:17.883
a chance to talk to him inside
the house. He had burns on his
hands.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.619
And I asked him, "Where did
you get burns on your hands?"

20:20.619 --> 20:23.422
"From working at Burger King."

20:23.422 --> 20:28.861
We pat him down and he's got $11
in his pocket. Not consistent
with what a dope dealer normally

20:28.861 --> 20:33.299
would be carrying. It just
didn't match up, I guess. I felt
like he was one of those people

20:33.299 --> 20:35.668
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.971
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, on this
day that you make a decision
that he is, in fact, innocent

20:38.971 --> 20:47.079
and that the drugs you found in
the house were not his, that's a
pretty monumental decision,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.147
right?

20:48.147 --> 20:51.650
CARON BUTLER: Definitely.

20:51.650 --> 20:55.121
I mean, it changed my life. It
changed everything. It was a
decision that really altered my
whole

20:55.121 --> 20:56.889
life.

20:56.889 --> 21:01.927
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because let's
say it had gone the other way.
Let's say he said: I'm

21:01.927 --> 21:04.830
going to book you. I don't
believe you when you say that
that's not your -- those are

21:04.830 --> 21:06.365
not your drugs in the garage.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.168
What would have happened to you?

21:09.168 --> 21:13.072
CARON BUTLER: Because of my past
already, and my lengthy record,
I could have been facing

21:13.072 --> 21:16.342
10 to 15 years. I would be 26,
25 years old getting out.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.811
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Career is over.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.380
CARON BUTLER: You know, all
those dreams of playing
basketball or doing all these
things

21:21.380 --> 21:23.582
would be gone.

21:23.582 --> 21:27.820
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's go back
a little bit in time. Obviously,
as you mentioned, you

21:27.820 --> 21:32.591
did have a very lengthy record.
You had spent a good deal of
time in the drug trade. I'm

21:32.591 --> 21:35.861
curious, what is it that
drew you to that trade?

21:35.861 --> 21:40.666
CARON BUTLER: I would have to
say, you know, from a youngster,
the second I jumped off

21:40.666 --> 21:50.309
the porch, you know, and that is
the second that I started
experiencing things in the

21:50.309 --> 21:58.250
neighborhood, I was exposed
to materialistic things.

21:58.250 --> 22:06.525
I saw guys riding around in the
nice cars with gold rims on it,
the Cadillacs, the 98s

22:06.525 --> 22:12.231
and the Buicks and the gold
chains and the jewelry, and had
the money and the flash.

22:12.231 --> 22:20.506
You know, it was just something
that I was intrigued by as a
youngster.

22:20.506 --> 22:26.679
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And those were
guys who were not working at the
manufacturing plant.

22:26.679 --> 22:32.818
CARON BUTLER: No, they wasn't
working a 9:00 to 5:00. They was
working around the clock.

22:32.818 --> 22:38.657
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, by the
time you two have this meeting
17 years ago, you had spent

22:38.657 --> 22:42.595
some time in prison. You had
decided to turn your life
around. What was it that changed

22:42.595 --> 22:44.964
your mind?

22:44.964 --> 22:50.836
CARON BUTLER: It was a
combination of things, one, some
of my closest friends that I
lost

22:50.836 --> 22:57.776
to the streets. And, two, I felt
like a huge disappointment to my
mother, who worked two

22:57.776 --> 23:01.313
jobs and did everything
that she possibly can do.

23:01.313 --> 23:05.851
SGT. RICK GELLER: That, to me, I
think, was the biggest factor,
because his mom really

23:05.851 --> 23:10.322
was, for one, working two or
three jobs, plus trying to keep
a handle on him.

23:10.322 --> 23:14.893
And, I mean, she would go out to
the park that we were talking
about, the 18th Street

23:14.893 --> 23:16.295
Mall, or...

23:16.295 --> 23:20.733
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is where
all the drug trade was going on.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.069
SGT. RICK GELLER: Yes, where all
the drug trafficking -- she
would get out of her car

23:24.069 --> 23:25.738
and chase him down.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.574
CARON BUTLER: Chase
me off the street.

23:28.574 --> 23:32.578
SGT. RICK GELLER: But she just
couldn't do it all the time.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.980
CARON BUTLER: Yes.

23:34.980 --> 23:41.053
SGT. RICK GELLER: And he got
better and better and better.
And I think when he finally got

23:41.053 --> 23:44.823
sent to Ethan Allen,
and his mom...

23:44.823 --> 23:46.725
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is
the correctional facility.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.328
SGT. RICK GELLER: Correct.

23:49.328 --> 23:54.733
When he finally was sent there,
and his mom was trailing behind,
hoping and praying that

23:54.733 --> 23:59.805
the car that she has will
continue to work, the tears are
rolling down her face, I mean,

23:59.805 --> 24:04.977
I think that was it for him. I
really do. I think that was a --
the shining moment.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.679
CARON BUTLER: I really did feel
like a huge disappointment, just
because I knew what she

24:06.679 --> 24:08.947
invested in me.

24:08.947 --> 24:16.855
And for me to, you know, throw
that all away and be in
corrections, and her having to
live

24:16.855 --> 24:22.895
with that void of me not being
there, that was frustrating. So
it was just -- it was

24:22.895 --> 24:28.867
all those things, and my mom
moving out my old neighborhood,
so when I got out, I was

24:28.867 --> 24:34.840
in a new environment. So I
didn't feel like I had to live
up to that -- the norm or the

24:34.840 --> 24:40.979
expectations of my former self.

24:40.979 --> 24:52.291
I felt like I had a fresh start.
And people started showing me a
lot of favor, putting

24:52.291 --> 24:59.932
me in some situations to be
successful. And I took full
advantage of it.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.433
SGT. RICK GELLER: In Caron's
case, too, there wasn't a real
father figure.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.769
CARON BUTLER: No.

25:03.769 --> 25:08.140
SGT. RICK GELLER: There was a
great mother figure, but not
really a father figure. So

25:08.140 --> 25:16.615
I think it finally came -- he
came to the conclusion, either I
keep hurting my mom,

25:16.615 --> 25:23.789
or I end up dead, or I end up in
prison for a long, long time.
And I think he just decided

25:23.789 --> 25:25.657
it wasn't worth it.

25:25.657 --> 25:33.565
And I'm so glad he did. And I
will tell you something. As far
as that father figure, he

25:33.565 --> 25:38.337
has, without hesitation, become
the father that he always hoped
for with his kids. So,

25:38.337 --> 25:39.538
I think that is...

25:39.538 --> 25:40.506
CARON BUTLER: Appreciate that.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.841
SGT. RICK GELLER: You bet.

25:42.841 --> 25:47.613
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The book is
"Tuff Juice: My Journey from the
Streets to the NBA."

25:47.613 --> 25:50.949
Caron Butler, Rick Geller, thank
you both very much for being
here.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.684
CARON BUTLER: Thanks
for having us.

25:52.684 --> 25:55.621
SGT. RICK GELLER: Thank you.

25:55.621 --> 26:00.926
JUDY WOODRUFF: During the
military dictatorship in
Argentina, from 1976 to 1983, as
many as

26:00.926 --> 26:06.131
30,000 people simply
disappeared. Some of those were
young pregnant women. An
estimated

26:06.131 --> 26:12.204
500 of their babies were then
given to couples who were often
deemed sympathetic to the
regime.

26:12.204 --> 26:17.576
What happened to those women and
their babies is explored by the
documentary project Retro

26:17.576 --> 26:21.847
Report and distributed by The
New York Times. We're partnering
with them to bring you a

26:21.847 --> 26:24.550
version of this piece here.

26:24.550 --> 26:28.220
MAN: three-man military junta
has taken over the government of
Argentina.

26:28.220 --> 26:32.424
NARRATOR: The coup began in the
early morning hours of March 24,
1976.

26:32.424 --> 26:37.629
MAN: The action was swift and
efficient, and the new ruling
junta composed of coup leaders

26:37.629 --> 26:39.998
seemed in firm control.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.702
NARRATOR: It wasn't long before
the military dictatorship
started rounding up guerrilla

26:43.702 --> 26:47.906
groups and those believed to
be left-wing subversives.

26:47.906 --> 26:53.645
Housewife and school principal
Estela de Carlotto was 47 years
old back in November of 1977

26:53.645 --> 26:57.416
when her 22-year-old daughter,
Laura, disappeared.

26:57.416 --> 27:03.155
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO, Grandmother
(through translator): She was
the first of my four children.
Laura

27:03.155 --> 27:07.493
was a very respectful girl, but
with a strong personality. She
became politically active

27:07.493 --> 27:10.262
because she wanted change.

27:10.262 --> 27:15.334
NARRATOR: Carlotto says she was
frantic to find out what had had
happened to her daughter.

27:15.334 --> 27:20.939
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): At that time I was
the same as other mothers,

27:20.939 --> 27:23.775
very naive. We didn't know that
the military were coming to kill
people. We were expecting

27:23.775 --> 27:26.278
the return of our children.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.882
NARRATOR: But it wasn't to be.
Carlotto would never hear from
her daughter Laura again.

27:29.882 --> 27:37.356
In August of 1978, she was
killed by her captors. Although
devastated, Estela de Carlotto
was

27:37.356 --> 27:42.828
one of the more fortunate ones.
She was given her daughter's
body to bury. It was two years

27:42.828 --> 27:47.099
later that she learned something
she had suspected: Laura had
been pregnant and given birth to

27:47.099 --> 27:49.868
a son before she was murdered.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.938
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): I buried Laura. I
knew where Laura was. But

27:52.938 --> 27:56.041
I didn't know where
my grandson was.

27:56.041 --> 27:59.244
NARRATOR: Not long after, she
joined the grandmothers, or
abuelas, of the Plaza de Mayo.

27:59.244 --> 28:02.414
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): Being on my own was
dangerous. I couldn't share

28:02.414 --> 28:04.416
my sorrow. So, to find the
grandmothers was to find
company, to exchange ideas and
to

28:04.416 --> 28:05.984
look after one another.

28:05.984 --> 28:11.023
NARRATOR: The dictatorship
lasted seven years. During that
time, as many as 30,000 people

28:11.023 --> 28:16.028
were tortured and killed at
detention camps all over the
country. Many of the victims

28:16.028 --> 28:18.964
were buried in mass graves.

28:18.964 --> 28:22.801
After the regime fell, the
grandmothers were desperate to
not only find out what had
happened

28:22.801 --> 28:28.106
to their children, but to also
recover their grandchildren, who
had been stolen at birth.

28:28.106 --> 28:32.010
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): In the beginning,
we were searching, but we didn't

28:32.010 --> 28:35.847
have a way to prove which
were our grandchildren.

28:35.847 --> 28:39.885
NARRATOR: So they turned to
science. And, in 1987, they
began storing their profiles

28:39.885 --> 28:43.956
in a newly created national
genetic bank. By May of 2014,
Estela de Carlotto and the

28:43.956 --> 28:46.558
grandmothers had found or
identified 113 missing
grandchildren.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.362
And, at the age of 83, her
determination seemed stronger
than ever.

28:50.362 --> 28:55.233
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): I will never stop
doing what I do, because there

28:55.233 --> 29:06.712
is inside a very powerful
strength that is love, love for
our children and grandchildren.

29:06.712 --> 29:19.725
IGNACIO HURBAN, Grandson of
Estela de Carlotto (through
translator): I first heard of
grandmothers

29:19.725 --> 29:21.793
and of Estela de Carlotto when I
graduated from secondary school
and went to study in

29:21.793 --> 29:23.962
a music conservatory.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.099
NARRATOR: Ignacio Hurban was
born in June of 1978, at the
height of the dictatorship.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.870
His parents were farmers near
the city Olavarria, some 220
miles from Buenos Aires. On his
36th

29:31.870 --> 29:36.341
birthday in 2014, Ignacio found
out that he had been adopted.

29:36.341 --> 29:40.379
IGNACIO HURBAN (through
translator): It was a shock,
yes. The parents who raised me
didn't

29:40.379 --> 29:45.350
tell me. When I asked them, they
confirmed what I had been told.

29:45.350 --> 29:48.654
NARRATOR: Not long after his
discovery, Ignacio went to the
grandmothers, who arranged for

29:48.654 --> 29:53.859
a blood test. In August of 2014,
just days after taking the test,
Ignacio got the results

29:53.859 --> 29:57.462
from the head of the commission.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.600
IGNACIO HURBAN (through
translator): She told me whose
grandchild I was and that my
grandmother

30:01.600 --> 30:03.602
was waiting for me, very
excited. We met immediately, the
next day.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.338
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): Given his good
nature and nice character, he
said,

30:06.338 --> 30:10.042
in jest, of course, "If I'm a
grandson of the grandmothers, I
hope Estela is my grandmother."

30:10.042 --> 30:12.644
He seemed to have sensed it.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.081
NARRATOR: Yuki Goni is an
author and journalist.

30:16.081 --> 30:20.652
YUKI GONI, Journalist: The
country came together, I think,
in this huge cry of joy. I went
to

30:20.652 --> 30:25.057
the press conference where she
appeared publicly with him for
the first time, and there's a

30:25.057 --> 30:27.626
room packed full of journalists
all in tears, myself included,
because she represented so

30:27.626 --> 30:29.494
much for us.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.730
I mean, she had been so brave.
She had put so much of herself
at stake. And, finally,

30:31.730 --> 30:34.299
she had her reward.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.935
NARRATOR: But it also meant
something else: Her grandson's
adoptive parents would face

30:36.935 --> 30:39.104
a legal investigation.

30:39.104 --> 30:44.076
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): The people who
raised my grandson committed a

30:44.076 --> 30:48.280
crime. It's a serious crime, a
crime against humanity. There
are extenuating circumstances,

30:48.280 --> 30:53.952
in that they were farm people
under a very domineering master,
who one day brought them

30:53.952 --> 31:00.992
a child and told them, do not
ask questions and never tell him
he is not your own son.

31:00.992 --> 31:05.997
I personally do not blame them
or exonerate them. That is in
the hands of the justice

31:05.997 --> 31:08.200
system.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.636
NARRATOR: Ignacio Hurban is now
Ignacio Montoya Carlotto.
Although he has changed his
name,

31:11.636 --> 31:15.907
he says his bond with the
parents who raised him remains
strong, and he is proud to be

31:15.907 --> 31:18.210
the 114th grandchild identified.

31:18.210 --> 31:22.414
At the age of 84, Estela de
Carlotto shows no sign of
slowing down, taking her message

31:22.414 --> 31:25.050
and now her grandson
around the world.

31:25.050 --> 31:29.187
IGNACIO HURBAN (through
translator): There is my public
life with my grandmother and

31:29.187 --> 31:33.225
my private and emotional life
with her, a life we're building.
In that sense, it's just

31:33.225 --> 31:35.827
a grandchild and a grandmother.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.331
ESTELA DE CARLOTTO (through
translator): When I met my
grandson, I could hug him. He
doesn't

31:39.331 --> 31:47.839
look like his mother, but I knew
that in his blood was my
daughter Laura. And it was like

31:47.839 --> 31:52.277
I got her back.

31:52.277 --> 31:56.481
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can watch the
full documentary by Retro
Report, "The Disappeared," on
The

31:56.481 --> 31:58.650
New York Times Web site.
That's nytimes.com.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.252
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight:
Yo-Yo Ma and his acclaimed
career. He's been on the stage

32:00.252 --> 32:03.355
since a very early age.

32:03.355 --> 32:08.226
Now, as Jeffrey Brown found when
he visited him in New York
recently, the renowned cellist's

32:08.226 --> 32:10.362
taking time in his latest work
to incorporate personal
milestones and reflections.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.566
JEFFREY BROWN: In their new
album, Yo-Yo Ma and longtime
collaborator and friend Kathryn

32:14.566 --> 32:19.070
Stott have used the music of
cherished composers, Bach,
Brahms, Gershwin and others, to
create

32:19.070 --> 32:23.375
a kind of soundtrack of change,
love and loss. It's called
"Songs From the Arc of Life."

32:23.375 --> 32:26.011
YO-YO MA, Cellist: What do
people remember from their
childhood, music from their
childhood?

32:26.011 --> 32:28.613
What do people go through when
they are teenagers, or what do
they go through when they're in,

32:28.613 --> 32:33.485
you know, adolescence, or middle
age, or you know, late age? We
have two "Ave Maria"s,

32:33.485 --> 32:36.188
the miracle of birth, the
infinitude of death.

32:36.188 --> 32:40.292
JEFFREY BROWN: Yo-Yo Ma was born
in Paris to musician parents and
moved to New York

32:40.292 --> 32:48.166
when he was 5. He'd begun cello
lessons a year earlier, and by
8, he and his violinist

32:48.166 --> 32:50.235
sister had performed on national
television in a concert
featuring Leonard Bernstein and

32:50.235 --> 32:53.104
other major figures.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.775
Over the years, he's turned out
some 90 albums, a classical
music star who's also recorded

32:56.775 --> 32:59.544
a wide variety of music from
this country and around the
world with a who's-who of
musicians

32:59.544 --> 33:01.279
from other genres. He's appeared
before presidents, received the
Presidential Medal of Freedom

33:01.279 --> 33:04.082
and the National Medal of Arts,
and the true sign of cultural
importance, made a cameo

33:04.082 --> 33:05.116
on "Sesame Street."

33:05.116 --> 33:07.285
ACTOR: Man, that is
one mellow cello.

33:07.285 --> 33:10.589
JEFFREY BROWN: All of this
before he turned 60 this month.
And between his birthday and

33:10.589 --> 33:12.858
several musical anniversaries,
when we met at a recording
studio in New York recently,

33:12.858 --> 33:16.061
I found him ready to
ponder his own life's arc.

33:16.061 --> 33:23.401
YO-YO MA: I think my path was a
little circuitous, because I was
born into a musical family,

33:23.401 --> 33:30.108
and so music was there. And so I
felt like I never chose to go
into music, because that's

33:30.108 --> 33:32.577
just what I did.

33:32.577 --> 33:38.216
And the accidental parts, you
know, my moving from France to
the United States because my

33:38.216 --> 33:45.891
father got a job in New York,
that was an accident. I think,
if I were growing up somewhere

33:45.891 --> 33:50.495
else, my life would have
turned out very differently.

33:50.495 --> 33:55.700
JEFFREY BROWN: But, surely, so
much work goes into making you
the musician you are and the

33:55.700 --> 34:01.172
life that you had, and the kind
of commitment and drive. That
goes beyond the accidental.

34:01.172 --> 34:05.243
YO-YO MA: Absolutely. I can be
incredibly focused, and, you
know, incredibly willful

34:05.243 --> 34:12.751
and stubborn, and -- but I think
I also want to figure out what
it's about.

34:12.751 --> 34:18.723
Yes, it takes a lot of focus. It
takes those 10,000 hours to do
something, but it's like,

34:18.723 --> 34:23.428
how does it fit in within
the context of living?

34:23.428 --> 34:31.136
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the major
projects of Ma's life connects
music from different ages

34:31.136 --> 34:40.478
and cultures. He created the
Silk Road Ensemble 15 years ago,
its name chosen for the ancient

34:40.478 --> 34:44.182
China-to-Europe trade route.

34:44.182 --> 35:02.634
We sat in as the collective,
comprising many nationalities,
worked on a composition by

35:02.634 --> 35:06.838
Syrian clarinetist Kinan
Azmeh titled "The Wedding."

35:06.838 --> 35:17.248
Ma says much of his own world
view, embodied in this effort to
blend sounds and cultures,

35:17.248 --> 35:21.586
is shaped by his immigrant past.

35:21.586 --> 35:26.291
YO-YO MA: And with everything
that's happening now, you know,
the refugee situation,
immigration

35:26.291 --> 35:28.193
situation, I'm an immigrant.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.928
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

35:29.928 --> 35:33.832
YO-YO MA: Je suis
immigrant, right?

35:33.832 --> 35:48.546
JEFFREY BROWN: But it's striking
to me -- and I'm wondering if it
hits you -- it must -- that

35:48.546 --> 35:57.989
even as this sort of era of
globalization, where there's
much more communication, and

35:57.989 --> 36:05.630
at the same time more tribalism,
more xenophobia, more tensions
around the world.

36:05.630 --> 36:11.269
YO-YO MA: Those are the
reactions that fear produces.

36:11.269 --> 36:27.419
Rather than get depressed when
change occurs, you could, you
know, where -- what would be

36:27.419 --> 36:34.225
the opposite of fear? I would
say it's hope. I have also spent
quite a lot of time thinking,

36:34.225 --> 36:40.765
well, you know, what can I do
between 60 and 70 that may be
useful?

36:40.765 --> 36:44.736
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what does
that mean in your case?

36:44.736 --> 36:50.875
YO-YO MA: I think, from my
perspective, I get more and more
pleasure seeing other people

36:50.875 --> 36:57.982
doing things and succeeding. And
I don't feel like I have to do
this and that in order to

36:57.982 --> 37:00.018
prove something.

37:00.018 --> 37:07.358
JEFFREY BROWN: What has been the
purpose or the goal for you that
music gives you?

37:07.358 --> 37:19.804
YO-YO MA: It's a friend, a
friend in need. It is -- it
gives joy. It gives solace.

37:19.804 --> 37:32.283
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, I have
seen you play so many times, and
now I get to ask you this.

37:32.283 --> 37:43.528
When you close your eyes, and
you kind of -- you know, your
head kind of goes back off,

37:43.528 --> 38:00.378
and then you're -- sometimes
there's this smile on your face,
are you thinking at that

38:00.378 --> 38:08.753
moment? Are you experiencing?
What's going on inside you while
you're playing?

38:08.753 --> 38:19.564
YO-YO MA: It's a process of
figuring out, what are the
priorities that need to be
communicated?

38:19.564 --> 38:38.783
So, basically, the most
important thing is that
something someone cared about,
whether

38:38.783 --> 39:42.747
it's a piece of music someone
wrote or something that I'm
playing, the content of

39:42.747 --> 39:48.152
which actually passes on to
somebody, and lives in somebody
else. I think that's where

39:48.152 --> 39:52.757
age makes a difference.

39:52.757 --> 40:13.611
JEFFREY BROWN: In September at
Royal Albert Hall in London,
Yo-Yo Ma gave himself a rather

40:13.611 --> 40:20.451
unusual 60th birthday present.
He performed all six of Bach's
solo cello suites, still

40:20.451 --> 40:26.858
considered the pinnacle of
composition for his instrument.

40:26.858 --> 40:32.130
It's an enormous challenge.

40:32.130 --> 40:46.144
YO-YO MA: It's a physical
check-in, because I have never
actually done them pretty much

40:46.144 --> 41:15.640
-- pretty much all in a row
without breaks. But it's also a
check-in in terms of where

41:15.640 --> 41:44.435
you are in life in terms of
focus. And the question is, have
I learned enough to be able

41:44.435 --> 42:15.133
to do this with total dedication
and focus? Can you -- can I pull
it off?

42:15.133 --> 42:46.497
JEFFREY BROWN: And the results
were? Are you a better musician
now?

42:46.497 --> 43:51.362
YO-YO MA: No, I'm not sure that
I'm better at anything, but I
think I feel that I can

43:51.362 --> 43:59.837
still contribute.

43:59.837 --> 44:22.560
You just keep learning.
Keep on trucking.

44:22.560 --> 44:55.927
JEFFREY BROWN: Alright,
Yo-Yo Ma, thanks so much.

44:55.927 --> 45:16.747
YO-YO MA: Thank you, Jeffrey.

45:16.747 --> 47:31.749
GWEN IFILL: Yo-Yo Ma played part

47:31.749 --> 47:58.109
of "Quartet From

47:58.109 --> 51:59.817
the End of Time" for us.

51:59.817 --> 52:16.333
