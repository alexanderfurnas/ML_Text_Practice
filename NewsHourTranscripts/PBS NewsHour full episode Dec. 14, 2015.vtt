GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Nearly 200 countries
make history with a breakthrough

00:13.680 --> 00:17.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
climate agreement.
What happens next?

00:17.217 --> 00:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead: An
ever-growing population shows
strength at the polls. We

00:22.422 --> 00:28.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at how the GOP is wooing
Latino voters and new shifts in
the race for president.

GWEN IFILL: Plus: A mysterious

GIOVANNI MELCARNE, Oliver Grower
(through translator): What is
certain is that these

00:35.302 --> 00:38.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plants are dying, that these
plants are drying, and we don't
know what the future will be,

00:38.839 --> 00:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we don't even know that
there's a solution to this
situation.

00:40.941 --> 00:47.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:52.452 --> 01:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
today insisted coalition forces
are hitting back at Islamic

01:02.462 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State militants harder than
ever. As a result, he said, the
group also known as ISIL has

01:08.402 --> 01:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost key leaders and control of
large swathes of Iraqi and
Syrian territories. The
president

01:14.808 --> 01:19.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outlined the progress after
meeting at the Pentagon with his
national security advisers.

01:19.313 --> 01:23.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Every day, we
destroy as well more of ISIL's

01:23.951 --> 01:28.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forces, their fighting
positions, bunkers, and staging
areas, their heavy weapons,
bomb-making

01:28.322 --> 01:31.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
factories, compounds
and training camps.

01:31.391 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In many places, ISIL has lost
its freedom of maneuver, because
they know, if they mass

01:36.096 --> 01:39.099 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
their forces, we
will wipe them out.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also called on allies in the
Middle East to step up their

01:42.336 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contributions to the fight.

01:45.605 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Late today, Saudi Arabia
announced that it is forming a
34-state Islamic military
coalition

01:52.212 --> 01:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to combat terrorism. It includes
Arab countries like Egypt and
Qatar and Islamic countries

01:56.616 --> 01:59.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Turkey and Pakistan.

01:59.720 --> 02:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Investigators in
Egypt say October's crash of a
Russian passenger jet can't be

02:05.425 --> 02:11.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called terrorism yet. That's in
direct conflict with Russian,
American and British statements

02:11.465 --> 02:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a bomb was probably to
blame. A group linked to the
Islamic State had claimed
responsibility

02:16.503 --> 02:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the Sinai crash that killed
all 224 people on board. Egypt's
assessment is a preliminary

02:22.642 --> 02:25.946 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
finding. Their
investigation is ongoing.

02:25.946 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Argentina, at
least 43 police officers died
today when their bus careened

02:32.386 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off a bridge, plunging 65 feet
into a ravine. The crash
occurred near Salta, roughly
1,000

02:39.659 --> 02:45.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
miles north of Buenos Aires.
Rescue crews pulled victims from
the overturned bus, which

02:45.232 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was carrying around 60 people.
Investigators believe the
accident was caused by a
ruptured

02:48.869 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tire.

02:50.937 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Up to 750,000 people
have evacuated the Central
Philippines as a powerful
typhoon

02:57.711 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made landfall. The storm slammed
into a tiny village on the
northern tip of Samar Island

03:04.217 --> 03:10.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, packing wind gusts up to
115 miles per hour. Authorities
warned the heavy rain

03:10.157 --> 03:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could trigger storm surges,
landslides, and coastal flooding
of up to 13 feet. There were

03:15.195 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no -- there was no immediate
word of casualties.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Official results
out today showed France's
Conservative Party held off

03:24.438 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a challenge by the far-right
National Front in the second
round of regional elections.

03:29.843 --> 03:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Conservatives, led by former
President Nicolas Sarkozy,
captured 40 percent of Sunday's

03:35.582 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
votes. Current President
Francois Hollande's Socialist
Party won nearly 29 percent, and

03:40.654 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the National Front
took 27 percent.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sarkozy warned the far-right's
strong showing in the first
round of votes should have
everyone

03:48.995 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on guard.

03:51.698 --> 03:55.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through translator):
This mobilization for our
candidates

03:55.335 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the second round should under
no circumstances allow us to
forget the warnings which were

04:00.140 --> 04:05.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sent to all political leaders,
us included, during the first
round of those regional
elections.

04:05.145 --> 04:10.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While the
National front garnered its
largest number of votes in any
election,

04:10.117 --> 04:14.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it still failed to win a single
region in the polls. Last night,
its leader, Marine

04:14.254 --> 04:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Le Pen, downplayed the loss.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINE LE PEN, President,
National Front Party (through
translator): The National Front
will

04:19.593 --> 04:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the main force of opposition
in the regional councils in
France, an opposition which will

04:27.834 --> 04:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be constructive, but demanding,
because we are free of any
associations, an imaginative

04:33.039 --> 04:36.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposition, because we are
free of any interest groups.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
anti-immigration National Front
Party had recently seen a rise
in popularity

04:41.314 --> 04:44.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the wake of last month's
deadly Paris attacks.

GWEN IFILL: In Saudi Arabia, at
least 20 women won seats on
local councils following the

04:50.490 --> 04:56.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ultra-conservative kingdom's
first election open to female
candidates and voters; 2,100

04:56.730 --> 05:01.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seats were up for grabs in
Saturday's vote, but Saudi women
are still banned from driving

05:01.301 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or making important decisions
without the approval of a male
relative.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, Army Sergeant Bowe
Bergdahl will face charges of

05:10.443 --> 05:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desertion and endangering his
fellow troops in a
court-martial. Bergdahl walked
off his

05:15.448 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
post in Eastern Afghanistan in
2009. He was held captive by the
Taliban for five years

05:21.688 --> 05:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before being traded for five of
the group's leaders in
Guantanamo Bay. He now faces the

05:26.159 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
possibility of life in prison.

05:29.196 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A Baltimore jury
today began deliberating the
fate of the first police officer
to stand

05:34.668 --> 05:39.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trial in the death of Freddie
Gray. Officer William Porter was
in the police van where

05:39.039 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gray sustained his
fatal neck injury.

05:43.210 --> 05:48.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In closing arguments,
prosecutors argued Porter should
have properly secured Gray in
the vehicle.

05:48.315 --> 05:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his defense said there is no
evidence Porter's actions caused
Gray's death.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Shrimp peeled by
enslaved migrant workers and
children in Thailand have made

05:58.792 --> 06:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their way to all 50 states. An
Associated Press investigation
found the seafood for

06:03.897 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sale at major retailers like
Wal-Mart and Whole Foods, and on
the menu at Red Lobster

06:10.103 --> 06:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Olive Garden. The laborers
were often held against their
will in unsanitary conditions

06:16.743 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and paid little to no wages.
Many of the American businesses
are now condemning the labor
abuse

06:21.514 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and vowing to investigate.

06:24.117 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Most recreational
drones will soon be required to
register with the Federal

06:29.389 --> 06:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aviation Administration. The
agency announced that today,
just in time for the holiday
gift-giving

06:34.794 --> 06:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
season. Remote-controlled
aircraft weighing between
half-a-pound and 55 pounds can
be

06:39.599 --> 06:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registered on the FAA's Web site
beginning December 21st. That
will help authorities

06:44.904 --> 06:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
track down an owner if a drone
collides with another aircraft
or ventures too close to

06:48.642 --> 06:50.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an airport.

06:50.910 --> 06:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stocks closed
higher on Wall Street today,
boosted in part by strong gains

06:55.982 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the oil industry. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained
103 points to close at 17368.

07:03.423 --> 07:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 19

GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour": Will the historic
climate accord lead to historic

07:14.067 --> 07:20.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

07:28.915 --> 07:41.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
invited world leaders today to
come

07:41.728 --> 07:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to New York this April to put
their signatures on a historic
climate accord.

07:46.900 --> 07:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are numerous questions
about its practical realities.
Six years after a summit

07:52.005 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Copenhagen failed to find
common ground, the Paris meeting
ended with a major blueprint

07:57.243 --> 08:02.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for governments and a
message to business.

08:02.849 --> 08:06.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Delegates from 195 countries
were on their feet after they
struck a landmark climate

08:06.720 --> 08:08.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal in Paris.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURENT FABIUS, French Foreign
Minister (through translator):
It's a small hammer, but I think

08:11.658 --> 08:13.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will do great things.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:16.129 --> 08:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: French Foreign
Minister Laurent Fabius,
president of the conference,
gaveled

08:20.300 --> 08:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the deal to extensive applause.

08:23.803 --> 08:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the U.N.'s climate chief, it
was a moment of success after
six years of failure.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES, Executive
Secretary, United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate

08:30.510 --> 08:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Change: I have been saying for a
long time, we must, we can. And
I used to say, we will.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, we can say, we did.

08:41.488 --> 08:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As delegates left
the conference, they cheered the
news and looked for the man

08:46.626 --> 08:51.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the hour, Laurent Fabius,
for autographs and pictures.

08:51.331 --> 08:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agreement lays out a number
of goals and timelines,
including keeping the global
temperature

08:56.903 --> 09:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rise well below 6.3 degrees
Fahrenheit. After 2050, manmade
emissions should be reduced

09:05.245 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a level that forests and
oceans can absorb. Wealthy
countries are encouraged, but
not

09:11.217 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
required to help poorer ones cut
emissions, to the tune of
pledging at least $100 billion

09:17.924 --> 09:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year. And nations have to
report on their emissions and
efforts to reduce them.

09:24.631 --> 09:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hours after the Paris pact,
President Obama chimed in his
praise from Washington.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: The Paris
agreement establishes the
enduring

09:32.839 --> 09:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
framework the world needs to
solve the climate crisis. It
creates the mechanism, the
architecture

09:39.312 --> 09:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for us to continually tackle
this problem in an effective
way.

09:44.684 --> 09:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even so, critics
of the deal still abound. In
Paris, some protesters said

09:50.690 --> 09:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this agreement doesn't go far
enough, citing no penalties for
countries that don't meet

09:54.761 --> 09:57.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their targets.

09:57.464 --> 10:04.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And back in the U.S.,
Republicans in Congress warned
the deal will be shredded in 13
months

10:04.270 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if a Republican is elected
president. Utilities and some
Republican politicians are also
challenging

10:10.076 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
emissions regulations in court.

10:14.247 --> 10:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how meaningful are this
weekend's pledges? And does it
signal a fundamental change in

10:19.052 --> 10:22.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how we will get our energy?

10:22.322 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred Krupp is the president of
the Environmental Defense Fund.
He's back from Paris. And Robert

10:27.627 --> 10:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bryce is a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute and the
author of several books

10:31.865 --> 10:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this. His latest is titled
"Smaller, Faster, Lighter,
Denser, Cheaper."

10:37.136 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you
both to the program.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred Krupp, to you first. How
much of a difference is this
agreement going to make?

10:44.911 --> 10:47.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED KRUPP, President,
Environmental Defense Fund: It's
going to make a big difference.

10:47.614 --> 10:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really the first COP that
exceeded the expectations that I
had going into it, the

10:53.853 --> 10:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first conference of the parties
that really set us on a path
toward solving this problem.

10:59.859 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Judy, it doesn't solve the
climate problem. No one meeting
could do that, not by a long

11:05.431 --> 11:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot, but it does get us a long
way there. The reductions that
have been pledged by nearly

11:11.237 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every country on Earth get us
perhaps halfway there. And then
there is a mechanism built

11:17.377 --> 11:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the agreement that allows
the ambitions to be ratcheted
up.

11:22.215 --> 11:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, perhaps most important,
there is transparency, which
means countries will have to be
reporting

11:28.922 --> 11:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their emissions, and there will
be a technical review of those
reports to make sure they're

11:34.027 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accurate. And that is critical,
so that there is not only
ambition here, but also
accountability.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Bryce, do
you this as an agreement that
goes a long way toward doing

11:42.902 --> 11:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something about climate change?

11:44.571 --> 11:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT BRYCE, Senior Fellow,
Manhattan Institute: I do not.

11:47.073 --> 11:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are three key
problems with it, Judy. First
is, none of these targets

11:52.011 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have been set by the
individual countries are legally
binding. Second, Ban Ki-Moon,

11:57.817 --> 12:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.N. secretary-general, made
this clear before the meeting
started in Paris when he

12:02.755 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that all of these targets
that have been made by the
individual countries are not
sufficient,

12:08.027 --> 12:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that they're going to have
to come back in just a few years
and provide new lower

12:10.997 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
targets for emissions.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, and perhaps most
importantly, there is nothing in
any of these agreements

12:17.870 --> 12:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that moves the ball forward on
nuclear energy, and this is the
key issue. When you listen

12:23.376 --> 12:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what the climate scientists
have been saying on this, on
December 3, in The Guardian,
James

12:28.181 --> 12:33.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hansen, one of the most
high-profile climate scientists
in the world, along with three

12:33.219 --> 12:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other climate scientists, said
that nuclear energy will make
the difference -- I'm quoting

12:38.291 --> 12:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "make the difference between
the world missing crucial
climate targets or achieving

12:41.160 --> 12:43.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them."

12:43.496 --> 12:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the hard reality is that,
unless we have an energy form
that can replace substantial

12:48.768 --> 12:53.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
quantities of coal-fired
generation -- and that means
natural gas and nuclear -- then

12:53.406 --> 12:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that we're not going to
come near any kind of
significant reductions in CO2

12:58.678 --> 13:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emissions to meet the CO2
emissions targets that have been
laid out.

13:03.282 --> 13:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Fred Krupp,
let me take his -- Mr. Bryce's
last point first, that

13:08.888 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the agreement doesn't make
meaningful progress on moving
toward nuclear or another real
alternative

13:14.293 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to carbon.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED KRUPP: Well, I would
strongly disagree with that.

13:20.566 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Countries are free to meet their
obligations any way they want
to, but they have to report

13:27.073 --> 13:32.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and be accountable, as I said
before. China plans to build 30
nuclear power plants and

13:32.812 --> 13:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is constructing about half that
number now. So, if nuclear
technology comes along that's

13:39.852 --> 13:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe and affordable, nuclear
very much is on the table and
could be part of the agreement.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Fred Krupp,
there is no requirement that
countries do that. Is that

13:47.960 --> 13:50.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
correct?

13:50.063 --> 13:53.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED KRUPP: Well, there is no
requirement that countries use
nuclear, no. They're free

13:53.232 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to use whatever
technology they choose.

13:57.370 --> 14:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some countries are pursuing
nuclear, and that's allowed. It
turns out, Judy, that the

14:04.444 --> 14:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost of solar panels in the last
five years has dropped 80
percent. So, if solar panels

14:10.950 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are cheaper than nuclear, why
should the -- an agreement
require countries to use
nuclear?

14:18.224 --> 14:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nuclear may end up cheaper. That
remains to be seen. Right now,
the plants that are being

14:21.894 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
built in the United States will
substantially raise the rates of
rate payers in the jurisdictions

14:28.534 --> 14:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where those are being built,
because, right now, it is an
expensive technology, at least

14:31.804 --> 14:34.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here in the U.S.

14:34.040 --> 14:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Bryce, why
isn't it sufficient, if not --
even the advocates of

14:40.480 --> 14:44.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this agreement are saying it's
not perfect, but why isn't it
sufficient that countries

14:44.484 --> 14:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are now saying they're going to
move in the direction, not all
necessarily nuclear, but

14:47.887 --> 14:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these other technologies,
alternative fuel technologies?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BRYCE: Sure. And we hear
about solar and wind. And we
have heard about solar and

14:53.059 --> 14:55.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wind.

14:55.161 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, I'm pro-solar. I have
solar panels on the roof of my
house. I'm not bullish on

15:01.300 --> 15:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wind, because it takes up too
much land. The problem,
fundamentally, for the
developing

15:05.138 --> 15:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world is that they're not
turning to solar and wind in a
big way. They're turning to

15:07.874 --> 15:11.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coal-fired capacity.

15:11.144 --> 15:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at the numbers that
have been published by Sierra
Club and CoalSwarm, two adamant

15:15.414 --> 15:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coal critics. They point out
that, today, there is 276
gigawatts of coal-fired capacity

15:22.622 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under construction now. That's
roughly equal to the entire
coal-fired capacity of the
United

15:26.325 --> 15:28.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

15:28.661 --> 15:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Krupp says we have to make
nuclear safer and cheaper.
There's no question. But to make

15:32.665 --> 15:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happen, we have to have
strong governmental leadership.
I have written many times about

15:37.303 --> 15:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this. I had a piece in The L.A.
Times just a few days ago. The
United States could be

15:41.140 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking a leadership position in
making nuclear energy safer,
cheaper, developing reactors

15:44.777 --> 15:47.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are passively safe.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we don't have the support --
this is key -- of the main
environmental groups, including

15:51.951 --> 15:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Environmental Defense Fund.
Sierra Club and Green Peace are
adamantly opposed to nuclear

15:54.620 --> 15:54.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
energy.

15:54.854 --> 15:55.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:55.454 --> 15:55.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All
right. Excuse me.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BRYCE: Sure.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm sorry for
interrupting, but let me let Mr.
Krupp respond.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED KRUPP: First of all, we're
not opposed to nuclear energy.

16:03.529 --> 16:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second of all, the statistics
about 276 plants, those were
statistics from a few years ago.

16:10.469 --> 16:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was planned, not under
construction. But we had a lot
of plants planned in the

16:16.108 --> 16:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States just a few short
years ago, and they have almost
all, to a one, been scrapped.

16:22.081 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, India's plans to build
coal-fired plants -- change will
come to India, because it's

16:27.086 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their own national interest.
Sure, they have to lift people
out of poverty. They need

16:31.657 --> 16:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
electricity. They need economic
development, but they also need
clean air. Right now, they

16:37.230 --> 16:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have more opportunities than
ever before to create jobs with
renewable energy and to have

16:46.038 --> 16:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clean air. The air pollution is
killing hundreds of thousands of
people a year in India.

16:51.143 --> 16:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So all I would say, Mr. Bryce,
to you is that no one predicted
how fast natural gas came

16:57.350 --> 17:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
online in the United States. It
was a big change. And the change
we're seeing now that

17:02.655 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think will surprise a lot of
people is how fast the cost of
these clean energy technologies

17:07.927 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are coming down.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
gentlemen, big subject. We are
clearly going to be coming back
to

17:12.865 --> 17:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it a lot in the future.

17:15.234 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to thank both of you,
Fred Krupp, Robert Bryce. Thank
you.

17:18.137 --> 17:22.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BRYCE: Thank you.

17:22.775 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED KRUPP: Thank you.

17:28.814 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's Politics
Monday, and we have two takes
this week on an increasingly
competitive

17:34.053 --> 17:36.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential race.

17:36.622 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Republicans prepare to debate
tomorrow night in Las Vegas,
religion and immigration

17:41.427 --> 17:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have emerged as running themes.
But are GOP candidates, led by
front-runner Donald Trump,

17:46.732 --> 17:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing more harm than good when
it comes to expanding the
party's base among a growing

17:50.036 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subset of Hispanic voters?

17:53.539 --> 17:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham traveled to
Washington State recently to
explore one effort, bankrolled

17:58.044 --> 18:04.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by the billionaire Koch
brothers, to recruit Hispanics
into the GOP's tent.

18:04.150 --> 18:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's election
night, and Avina Gutierrez just
made history. For the

18:09.822 --> 18:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time ever, voters in
Yakima, Washington, elected a
Hispanic candidate to their city

18:14.560 --> 18:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
council, not just one, in fact.
Three Latinos won seats tonight,
this in a city where 40

18:19.298 --> 18:22.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent of residents
are Hispanic.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 35-year-old Democrat says
tonight's victory is just
another sign of the growing
presence

18:25.938 --> 18:28.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Latinos in politics.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVINA GUTIERREZ, Yakima City
Council Member: Tonight means
that I will be able to provide

18:30.476 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an example for other Latinas to
see that they do have a seat at
that table.

18:34.413 --> 18:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her election
is part of a national trend. The
Latino population of

18:38.351 --> 18:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. has been steadily
rising, while the white
population has been declining.

18:42.955 --> 18:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 2065, the U.S. is projected
to be a majority-minority
nation, with whites making up
less than half

18:49.628 --> 18:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the population. Politically,
this trajectory has been great
news for Democrats like
Gutierrez.

18:55.401 --> 19:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In national polls, Latinos lean
Democratic more than 2-1 over
Republicans. And, in 2012,

19:02.408 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latinos overwhelmingly picked
President Obama over Mitt
Romney, whose remarks about
Latinos

19:06.145 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
needing to self-deport
didn't sit well with many.

19:10.449 --> 19:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In its own political autopsy of
that election, the Republican
National Committee openly
acknowledged

19:15.721 --> 19:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if the party couldn't
figure out a better way to
communicate with Latino voters,
it

19:20.426 --> 19:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would spell electoral doom for
the GOP -- quote -- "It does not
matter what we say about
education,

19:26.732 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
jobs or the economy. If
Hispanics think we do not want
them here, they will close their

19:29.935 --> 19:37.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ears to our policies."

19:37.276 --> 19:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where Daniel Garza
comes in. He's the head of The
LIBRE Initiative. It's the

19:41.447 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largest conservative Hispanic
political group in the country.
And he's just been given $16

19:46.552 --> 19:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million from the conservative
billionaire Koch brothers to try
and convince Latinos

19:51.057 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that conservative ideals and
Latino ideals are one and the
same.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA, The LIBRE
Initiative: We are driving a
conversation within the Latino
community

19:59.331 --> 20:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the virtues of the free
market, whether it's engaging
them on policy issues or on

20:05.071 --> 20:09.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cultural issues. So, for
example, we believe strongly in
self-reliance, in personal
responsibility,

20:09.809 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that hard work ethic, the
American rugged individualism.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garza served
in George W. Bush's White House,
and now regularly hosts

20:16.782 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forums with today's
GOP candidates.

20:20.753 --> 20:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his story begins much more
humbly, here, in the
agriculturally-rich Yakima
Valley in

20:25.458 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Central Washington. The Hispanic
population has exploded here in
recent decades, as migrant

20:30.796 --> 20:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families like Garza's, who once
just came through to pick apples
and cherries during

20:34.733 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the harvest, decided to
stay and put down roots.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Garza showed us the hops fields
-- they're now out of season --
where he and his family

20:41.540 --> 20:43.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
used to work.

20:43.642 --> 20:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: Backbreaking work,
working in the elements. Didn't
pay hardly anything,

20:48.013 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you were powerless. And I
don't know of any mother who
says, I can't wait for my child

20:51.250 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to grow up to be a farm worker.
It just doesn't happen. But it's
noble work.

20:56.655 --> 21:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They lived in
nearby Toppenish, Washington,
population 9,000, in this little

21:00.626 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
house with no running water.

21:03.395 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: The idea, as farm
workers, is that you rent the
cheapest home you can.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was,
admittedly, a tough life. But
Garza's dad was able to save up

21:12.204 --> 21:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his money and eventually buy
this small motel in town.

21:16.509 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was this step up the economic
ladder where young Daniel began
finding his political beliefs.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He became a cop. He took a job
working for the hard-charging
Republican Congressman Doc

21:25.951 --> 21:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hastings. He was a huge fan of
William F. Buckley on "Firing
Line." It all made sense

21:30.956 --> 21:34.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to him, and he became a
card-carrying member of the
Republican Party.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: You know, I sort
of was taken by Ronald Reagan's
approach to governance

21:39.665 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sort of embraced it.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Reagan
famously said that Hispanics are
conservatives; they just don't

21:45.237 --> 21:45.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
know it yet.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, do you believe that?

21:47.873 --> 21:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: I do. I do believe
that. And I have always believed
that they embrace the

21:50.809 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ideals of the free market.

21:53.979 --> 21:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that's the
message The LIBRE Initiative is
pushing today, with slickly

21:59.552 --> 22:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
produced videos starring Garza
using his rags-to-riches story
as a symbol of conservative
Latino empowerment.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: My father never
took welfare because he didn't
want to depend on anyone

22:08.027 --> 22:11.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or lose his dignity.

22:11.130 --> 22:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They're also
spreading their message in more
subtle ways. This is actually

22:20.339 --> 22:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a driver's education class run
by Garza's group. This one's in
Las Vegas, but they do

22:24.944 --> 22:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these in swing states all over
the U.S. The idea is, you draw
Latinos in for useful classes

22:30.549 --> 22:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like these -- they also teach
English-language classes and
help prepare tax returns.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while they're there, those
voters get a little dose of
conservative politics on

22:37.823 --> 22:39.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the side.

22:39.925 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: I would say, we
use that opportunity as a
platform for ourselves to drive
our ideas,

22:44.797 --> 22:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk to folks and connect
with them. And then, you know,
if it resonates with them,

22:48.467 --> 22:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then they join our effort and
they stay connected with us.

22:52.404 --> 22:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garza's group
collects contact information at
these events for themselves,

22:56.075 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which it then shares with a
group called i360, a massive
voter database operation funded

23:00.346 --> 23:03.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the Koch brothers' network.

23:03.515 --> 23:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For LIBRE, the hope is that
these events, with their focus
on economic liberty and family

23:07.219 --> 23:09.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
values, will resonate
with Latino voters.

23:09.955 --> 23:13.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: When you're going
out directly to them and
tailoring your message to them,

23:13.325 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then you're earning their trust
and their respect, because
you're connecting with them.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they matter. And that's what
voters need to feel, that my
life is going to be better

23:20.933 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if I vote for that
person or that person.

23:23.335 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINFA GUTIERREZ, Radio Talk Show
Host: I don't think that's going
to -- they're going to

23:23.636 --> 23:26.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
buy that.

23:26.839 --> 23:33.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ninfa
Gutierrez hosts a popular
call-in radio show on KDNA,
Yakima

23:33.112 --> 23:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
valley's Spanish-language public
radio station. She says that,
with the presidential election

23:37.683 --> 23:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly a year off, right now,
there's only one thing her
listeners associate with
conservatives

23:41.954 --> 23:44.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Republicans.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: They're bringing
drugs. They're bringing crime.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're rapists.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINFA GUTIERREZ: The first call
that we got on one of those
programs said, because that

23:51.130 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clown that is saying all these
things about the Spanish people.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Donald
Trump, they're talking about.

23:57.202 --> 24:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINFA GUTIERREZ: Yes, Donald
Trump, that he doesn't know what
he's talking about. He doesn't

24:00.973 --> 24:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know us, who we are, because
he's saying that we're all,
what, drug dealers, we're
killers,

24:06.378 --> 24:09.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we're this and that.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And the
leading GOP front-runner isn't
showing any signs of backing
down from

24:11.850 --> 24:14.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his tough stance on
illegal immigration.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The wall works,
believe me, properly done.
Believe me.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

24:18.324 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While none of
the Republican candidates
support President Obama's
executive

24:22.328 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actions allowing undocumented
immigrants to stay in the
country, some argue massive
deportation

24:27.499 --> 24:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't feasible. Others argue
that the GOP's harsh words about
immigrants will be a boon

24:31.236 --> 24:33.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Democrats.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Even having this
conversation sends a powerful

24:36.909 --> 24:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
symbol. They're doing high-fives
in the Clinton campaign right
now, when they hear this.

24:40.846 --> 24:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Indeed, super
PACs supporting Democrats are
already out with ads with Latino

24:44.416 --> 24:47.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters quoting the
GOP candidates.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: They're rapists.

24:48.220 --> 24:48.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Criminals.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Anchor babies.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garza, who
spoke to an auditorium of
seniors at his old high school,
acknowledges

24:55.728 --> 25:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the GOP's current stance on
immigration is driving Latinos
away from his party.

25:01.033 --> 25:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's been vocal about the
need for them to knock it off
and to embrace comprehensive

25:05.104 --> 25:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration reform. But, as he
told these students at a school
that is 86 percent Latino,

25:16.348 --> 25:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he hopes voters focus on more
than just the one issue of
immigration.

25:20.185 --> 25:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: Republicans are
calling that we should now
empower the individual, that

25:24.022 --> 25:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we should focus on growing the
private sector, much more than
growing the government.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Afterwards,
Garza got the rock star
treatment, with students
swarming

25:32.965 --> 25:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around, jockeying for selfies
and autographs. But did his
message resonate?

25:38.303 --> 25:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We sat down with a smaller group
of students from the school to
find out.

25:41.874 --> 25:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there was a candidate that
stood for all the things you
cared about, whatever those

25:46.745 --> 25:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues are -- and they were --
it seems like this is my ideal
president, but they didn't

25:50.749 --> 25:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agree with you on immigration
reform, could that person still
get your vote?

25:53.352 --> 25:54.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: No.

25:54.720 --> 26:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I wouldn't vote for
him. My pride is where my family
comes from, so I don't

26:02.161 --> 26:05.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- he could be -- I can agree
with him with everything else,
but if he doesn't benefit

26:05.564 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my people in the immigration
reform, I would not vote for
him.

26:08.600 --> 26:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you see it
as a challenge to your mission,
though, that many leaders

26:13.939 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the GOP come out and say
things that drive the Latino
population into the arms of the

26:18.110 --> 26:19.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats?

26:19.778 --> 26:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: So, our objective
is to get Latinos behind free
market ideas, the principles

26:25.150 --> 26:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of limited government. That's
our objective. Whatever happens
politically, we can't control

26:30.522 --> 26:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. We can just help to drive
a conservation within the Latino
community.

26:34.092 --> 26:39.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Every 30
seconds, another Latino turns 18
in this country. Most of them

26:39.331 --> 26:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are American citizens and
eligible to vote. If these
students are any reflection of
the

26:43.602 --> 26:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broader population, Daniel Garza
has got his work cut out for
him.

26:47.673 --> 26:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Toppenish,
Washington.

26:51.643 --> 26:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now, for more on
where the race stands, including
some surprising new

26:55.681 --> 26:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poll numbers, we turn to our
regular Monday night duo, Tamara
Keith of NPR, and Amy Walter

26:59.785 --> 27:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome back.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Thank you.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Thank you.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk -- get
right to these numbers, very
interesting, over the weekend.

27:07.259 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw a Des Moines Register
poll, the Iowa Republican poll,
the gold standard. And in

27:12.164 --> 27:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, we have Cruz at 31 percent,
up 21 percent from the last poll
in October, where he was

27:18.604 --> 27:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only at 10. Trump is at 21
percent, essentially the same
where he was before.

27:23.542 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a big deal. But right
after that, today, we saw a new
Quinnipiac Iowa poll,

27:28.146 --> 27:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in which it's -- basically, it's
a tied race. Trump is at 28
percent. He's up 3 percent

27:34.553 --> 27:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 25 percent last time they
went in the field, and Ted Cruz
is at 27 percent, up 4

27:40.592 --> 27:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent, so they're like neck
and neck, 28-27 percent, well
within anybody's margin of
error.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's happening? What
is this Cruz surge?

27:47.966 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Cruz has benefited
from a couple of things. The
first is, the decline of Ben

27:51.703 --> 27:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carson. That wasn't on the poll
chart, but what you would see is
Ben Carson really plummeting

27:57.276 --> 27:58.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the polls.

27:58.944 --> 28:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He went from 28
percent to 13 percent in that
Des Moines poll.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, in that Des
Moines Register poll. And you
saw a drop-off too in the
Quinnipiac

28:05.684 --> 28:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poll. So, he has dropped off.
And that has benefited Ted Cruz
most significantly.

28:11.757 --> 28:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the other thing that Cruz
has been able to do is, he's put
the three most important

28:15.894 --> 28:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legs of the stool together for
Iowa. He has got evangelicals,
very conservative voters.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Of course, I'm going to
forget the third one.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:25.170 --> 28:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: As I remembered that
-- the evangelicals and people
who are Tea Party supporters.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: OK. See, I need to
go to my notes, but I knew there
were three.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

28:33.946 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, he's getting
strong support from all three of
those groups. Those are

28:38.350 --> 28:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the groups that determine who
the winner of Iowa will be.

28:42.421 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does he also do well
among people who hate
Washington? He came to
Washington,

28:47.526 --> 28:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but then immediately went to war
against Washington. He calls it
the cartel.

28:50.128 --> 28:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, he came to
Washington, joined the Senate,
and proceeded to help government

28:54.032 --> 28:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- shut the government down.

28:56.435 --> 29:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he led the government
shutdown. And then,
interestingly -- and thinking
about

29:01.273 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ted Cruz reminded me of this --
less than a month after the
government shutdown ended,

29:05.477 --> 29:11.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he went to Iowa, and he gave a
big speech at the Iowa
Republican Party statewide
dinner.

29:11.783 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has been building the
groundwork in Iowa since before
the government shutdown.

29:17.456 --> 29:22.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He came to Washington to raise
his profile, and he did with
things like the government

29:22.027 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shutdown, and then he goes to
Iowa years before an election,
and has people text in to join

29:30.035 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz's army. And he has a
huge infrastructure. He has a
huge ground game, especially in
Iowa,

29:37.242 --> 29:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but also in Southern states,
which will be key after Iowa.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, one interesting
detail, last week, before this
latest round of polling

29:45.684 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
came out, Donald Trump
immediately started trashing the
poll, in advance, possibly
anticipating

29:50.722 --> 29:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on -- I don't know whether he's
doing his own polling -- that
things were not going

29:52.491 --> 29:55.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we were all holding
our breath, thinking, what will
Trump say about Cruz,

29:59.965 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has taken pains not to
publicly criticize Donald Trump?
What will Trump say?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, then very quickly
yesterday, I believe it was on
"FOX News Sunday" -- let's take

30:07.472 --> 30:10.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a listen -- this is
what he had to say.

30:10.542 --> 30:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You look at the
way he's dealt with the Senate,
where he goes in there like

30:15.714 --> 30:18.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- frankly, like a little bit
of a maniac. You're never going
to get things done that

30:18.583 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

30:20.786 --> 30:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I built a phenomenal
business. I'm worth many, many
billions of dollars. I have some

30:25.357 --> 30:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the greatest assets anywhere
in the world. You can't walk
into the Senate and scream

30:31.096 --> 30:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and call people liars, and not
be able to cajole and get along
with people. He will

30:37.569 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never get anything done. And
that's the problem with Ted.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Donald Trump...

30:41.006 --> 30:41.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:41.740 --> 30:43.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: It's kind
of ironic, isn't it?

30:43.008 --> 30:43.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: That is
something interesting.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

30:46.011 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the argument against Ted
Cruz, is that he led the fight
to shut the government

30:50.882 --> 30:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, that he leads a lot of
fights, but he doesn't have a
lot of victories. And yet,

30:53.618 --> 30:54.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming from...

30:54.186 --> 30:55.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Or friends.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Or friends.

30:57.022 --> 31:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet coming somebody who is
more than happy to take on the
establishment and tell them

31:02.327 --> 31:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where to stick it, I don't know
that this is the guy that's
going to be able to unite

31:05.664 --> 31:08.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America either.

31:08.033 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump has
been an interesting character in
all of this. He has been the

31:11.269 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
naysayer, and it feels like,
right behind him, Ted Cruz has
been waiting to take that

31:16.575 --> 31:17.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mantle away.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:19.377 --> 31:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times had a very
interesting piece of audio of
Ted Cruz at a closed door

31:24.282 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund-raiser, saying that he was
going to hug Donald Trump and
Ben Carson until they -- you

31:31.189 --> 31:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, until gravity took hold of
their campaigns, which he fully
anticipated gravity will take

31:35.327 --> 31:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hold, and then he will be there,
just waiting to scoop up all
that support.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then, in that same
-- in that same appearance, he
raised questions about

31:41.566 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their judgment.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:44.069 --> 31:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely --
well, because he was behind
closed doors, so he didn't have

31:45.937 --> 31:46.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hug quite so tightly.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Then, of course,
the audio got out. And that is
in part what prompted Donald

31:52.744 --> 31:57.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump to really pick a fight and
start the tweet storm, which Ted
Cruz was like, I'm

31:57.249 --> 31:58.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not taking the bait.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

32:00.218 --> 32:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow night,
another -- another -- yet
another in a series of
weeknights spent

32:04.122 --> 32:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching debates for the three
of us. So, we're going to --
they're all gathering in

32:07.092 --> 32:09.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Las Vegas. What do
they have to do?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people we
didn't mention in these polls
who are having -- who are
struggling

32:11.863 --> 32:13.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I don't think that
this debate is going to change
the trajectory of this

32:17.135 --> 32:22.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race. I think we have seen the
race now basically come down to
three, maybe four people. And

32:22.607 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's Donald Trump and it's Ted
Cruz and it's Marco Rubio.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one person who I think is
sort of on the bubble right now
is Chris Christie, who is

32:29.981 --> 32:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing better in New Hampshire.
And I think this environment
that we're in right now,

32:33.985 --> 32:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one where terrorism and security
is the top of the mind for
voters, especially Republican

32:37.455 --> 32:41.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters, that plays well
to Christie's strengths.

32:41.359 --> 32:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he will be making
that case a lot tomorrow night,
and making that distinction

32:46.198 --> 32:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between himself, governor in New
Jersey, been around during
terrorism strikes, I know how

32:53.238 --> 32:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with this, these other
guys don't know what they're
doing.

32:55.407 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How does Marco Rubio
distinguish himself in that kind
of field?

32:59.211 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think that there
is more pressure on Marco Rubio
heading into this debate than

33:01.980 --> 33:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there have been in past debates.

33:04.850 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's continually had a strong
debate performance, but now
people are sort of expecting him
to

33:10.822 --> 33:14.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have a strong debate
performance. And so I think a
lot of people will be watching
him

33:14.159 --> 33:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that performance. The
question, though, is, he has
these good debate performances,

33:19.431 --> 33:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then there is this buzz, and
then he maybe moves up a couple
points. He doesn't have

33:23.101 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the big surge that Ted Cruz has.

33:25.971 --> 33:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In part, that is because Ted
Cruz is competing on the
anti-establishment, Tea Party,
evangelical

33:33.545 --> 33:37.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
side, and Marco Rubio is
competing on the other side of
the Republican Party, the
establishment

33:37.048 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side, which is a very crowded
neighborhood right now.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: And I think,
ultimately, the winner is going
to be the person, like Ted Cruz,

33:44.856 --> 33:50.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who is an establishment
candidate, but puts themselves
as anti-establishment.

33:50.061 --> 33:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ted Cruz is a member of the
United States Senate, has been
part of the Bush administration

33:53.798 --> 33:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in his past, but now
is running against...

33:55.066 --> 33:56.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:56.635 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm going to be
watching Ben Carson to see if he
can break out, or anybody else

34:01.306 --> 34:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the fringes. It's going to be
-- I think it's going to be very
interesting.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: It will be
interesting, I don't doubt.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Call me.

34:06.578 --> 34:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith,
thank you both very much.

34:11.149 --> 34:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

34:18.023 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
now to overseas.

34:23.828 --> 34:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras says that he will not
allow his country to become what

34:28.867 --> 34:34.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he calls a warehouse for
refugees. And Europe's border
agency is expected to send
agents to

34:34.539 --> 34:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greece soon in an attempt to
stem the inflow of migrants.

34:39.477 --> 34:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Currently, refugees from only
the conflicts in Syria,
Afghanistan and Iraq are being
permitted

34:44.416 --> 34:48.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to transit Greece to
countries farther north.

34:48.353 --> 34:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports, there's
now a roadblock on that trail,

34:53.758 --> 34:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving many migrants from other
countries with some tough
choices.

34:58.330 --> 35:04.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Spanish
lifeguards respond to a call
from volunteers scanning the
horizon

35:04.269 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the cliffs of Lesbos. They're
heading out to the channel to
shepherd the flimsy inflatables

35:07.739 --> 35:11.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to safety.

35:11.476 --> 35:16.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
After several rough days
prevented crossings from Turkey,
the seas are calm. A flotilla

35:16.581 --> 35:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of overcrowded rubber dinghies
is using the shortest crossing
between the two countries.

35:21.353 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The occupants have paid $1,000 a
head for the journey. In the
distorted economics of

35:27.292 --> 35:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the migrant trail, safe arrival
represents value for money,
especially for Syrians like

35:30.795 --> 35:33.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hamza Hussein.

35:33.365 --> 35:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAMZA HUSSEIN, Refugee: You need
to kill Bashar. They are killing
people now. I am too -- I

35:40.472 --> 35:45.110 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
can't speak now,
please. Thank you.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the middle
of the picture, you can see a
lifeguard trying to help a
refugee

35:49.581 --> 35:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has plunged into the sea 50
meters off shore. Mohammed Asti
Mimi is an Iraqi, given

35:55.854 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
priority by Europe in the
new two-tier migrant trail.

35:59.824 --> 36:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ASTI MIMI, Refugee:
Yes, I have been swimming. I
have been swimming, because I

36:04.262 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought was funny,
jumped into water.

36:07.766 --> 36:12.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Having secured
a foothold in Europe, the
Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis

36:12.637 --> 36:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are assured of a relatively
swift passage to the destination
of their choice. But all

36:18.610 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other nationalities on this
beach have arrived as the gates
have shut, after Greece's
neighbor,

36:24.015 --> 36:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Macedonia, said it would only
admit people from these three
conflicts.

36:30.288 --> 36:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Farmer Costas Bayotis, who helps
the refugees ashore and salvages
the rafts' components,

36:35.260 --> 36:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disapproves of what he believes
is a discriminatory system.

36:39.364 --> 36:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COSTAS BAYOTIS, Farmer (through
translator): In my opinion, all
the world is suffering.

36:45.236 --> 36:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they're from Afghanistan,
Iran, Iraq, or Bangladesh, they
are all in the same situation

36:49.974 --> 36:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and must be helped. They have
all got souls. The politicians
are more educated than we

36:54.579 --> 36:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are, so let them try and come up
with a solution for a better
tomorrow for these people, the

36:57.982 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best possible.

37:00.151 --> 37:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dawn at the
next step on the migrant trail,
Piraeus, the country's

37:05.690 --> 37:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
key port on the mainland, where,
daily, ferries arrive carrying
thousands of people, aiming

37:10.428 --> 37:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pass through Greece
as quickly as possible.

37:14.566 --> 37:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The intention of most is to
travel more than 300 miles north
to Macedonia. At the ramps,

37:22.073 --> 37:25.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scores of travel agents offer
bus tickets to the border.

37:25.543 --> 37:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Macedonia. Macedonia.

37:30.715 --> 37:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But this is the
ultimate destination for those
who are not Syrian,

37:37.388 --> 37:42.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi or Afghan: a fenced-off
former Olympic martial arts
stadium in Athens. All other

37:42.994 --> 37:47.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nationalities have been
transported here after last
week's closure by Greece of a
camp at

37:47.031 --> 37:50.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Idomeni on the border
with Macedonia.

37:50.502 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Food is in short supply, and
volunteers have struggled to
pacify the newcomers.

37:54.772 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We are here to help you.

37:58.143 --> 37:57.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: "We are here to
help you," called out a
volunteer, urging everyone to

37:57.876 --> 37:59.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stay calm.

37:59.310 --> 38:03.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Help us. Don't push.

38:03.515 --> 38:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's been a
venue for violence, stabbing,
protests and arrests.

38:08.353 --> 38:13.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Conditions are a problem.
There is a sleeping problem.
There is a food problem.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a big line. That people
are from Morocco and all these
countries. Yes, the fighting

38:16.294 --> 38:21.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a problem.

38:21.032 --> 38:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Outside the
stadium, we met 22-year old
Tassdaq Hussain from Pakistan,

38:27.972 --> 38:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of those deported from
Idomeni last week, when Greece
acknowledged that Macedonia
wouldn't

38:31.643 --> 38:34.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compromise over its
wide-ranging ban.

38:34.946 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TASSDAQ HUSSAIN, Refugee: But
now I have no idea how to go to
Germany and other countries,

38:40.919 --> 38:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because this border is sealed
for us and Iranians and some
countries. We request to
European

38:49.661 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union and other countries, help
us and please try to open the
border for us.

38:54.832 --> 38:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In common with
other excluded nationalities,
Hussain's options are to seek

38:59.904 --> 39:05.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asylum in Greece, leave the
country within 30 days, or be
repatriated with a small
financial

39:05.310 --> 39:07.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grant.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the government gives you
money to go back, will you go
back?

39:10.615 --> 39:15.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TASSDAQ HUSSAIN: How much money
do they give? We have spent more
than $4,000, more than

39:15.687 --> 39:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$4,000. They give us 400 euros.
This is too much -- little. This
is the main problem.

39:30.668 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many People have sold all his
fields, his animals, his house,
and like this. They have

39:37.875 --> 39:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no business here. If they have
good -- why come here? If
anybody is comfortable in their

39:44.115 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country and their
homeland, why come here?

39:48.786 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the Greek
Parliament, Prime Minister
Alexis Tsipras, once a supporter

39:53.858 --> 39:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of open borders, made it clear
that times have changed, as a
result of Macedonia's ban

39:58.263 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and European pressure.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
It is true that, if this influx

40:04.936 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues, there is a danger for
the country to be turned into a
warehouse for immigrants.

40:09.774 --> 40:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the country must not and
will not become a warehouse. We
welcome the establishment

40:14.545 --> 40:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a European Coast Guard. It is
welcome, and the Greek forces
will contribute.

40:19.017 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Europe's
reinforcements will arrive at a
time when Turkey is supposed to

40:23.454 --> 40:28.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be stemming the flow of
migrants, in return for more
than $3 billion and a promise to

40:28.159 --> 40:31.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speed up the process
of joining the E.U.

40:31.963 --> 40:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the large number of boats
landing in Lesbos has left some
analysts like Ioannis
Papageorgiou

40:36.934 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wondering what Turkey
is doing for its money.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IOANNIS PAPAGEORGIOU, Political
Scientist: I think it's a
disgrace that we have to suffer

40:42.940 --> 40:49.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- suffer blackmail from Turkey
as the European Union, but it's
realpolitik. I'm not sure

40:49.147 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they will be able to
fulfill their side of the
bargain. And I'm not also sure
that

40:54.852 --> 40:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the European Union will fulfill
its side of the bargain either.

40:58.122 --> 41:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Many of those
people now arriving in Lesbos
face real frustration,

41:03.127 --> 41:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it looks as though the
migrant trail has been severed.

41:07.031 --> 41:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greece's neighbors, Macedonia
and Bulgaria, are effectively
blocked. And the only other

41:12.403 --> 41:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible available route over
land is Albania. Now, that
nation is mountainous. It's
freezing

41:18.343 --> 41:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cold in winter, and overall is
much more dangerous than any
other Balkan country. But the
traffickers

41:24.048 --> 41:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are considering opening that up
as the next possible option,
even though they're well

41:27.819 --> 41:32.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aware that people may
possibly die there.

41:32.890 --> 41:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, having survived the game of
Russian roulette that is the sea
crossing from Turkey, the

41:38.629 --> 41:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugees have become used to
making calculated risks. The
hope of finding safe haven and

41:43.768 --> 41:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relative prosperity keeps
driving this historic movement
of humanity.

41:48.406 --> 41:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Lesbos.

41:55.713 --> 42:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next: Olive oil is a
staple in many of America's
kitchens, and much of it

42:11.329 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is produced in Italy. But a
mysterious infection is now
threatening that industry and a
way

42:15.466 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of life.

42:17.769 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown recently traveled
to the olive groves of Southern
Italy.

42:22.006 --> 42:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's the heel of
Italy's boot. The Salento region
may be less known than

42:27.812 --> 42:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country's more famous
tourist areas. But it boasts
beautiful port towns and idyllic

42:33.418 --> 42:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country roads lined with farms,
vineyards and, most of all, its
renowned olive groves,

42:38.756 --> 42:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some thousands of years old.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIOVANNI MELCARNE, Oliver Grower
(through translator): For us,
these are not only trees

42:43.628 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that produce olive oil, but they
are the Salento landscape
itself. Without these trees, the

42:46.531 --> 42:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Salento will no longer exist.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A deadly bacteria
dubbed an olive Ebola has
infected someone million trees

42:55.139 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so far, about 10 percent of the
trees in the larger Puglia
province. Some of those olive

43:00.211 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
groves have been in
families for generations.

43:03.815 --> 43:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the case for Giovanni
Melcarne, a grower who believes
500 of his 5,000 trees are now

43:08.519 --> 43:10.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infected.

43:10.021 --> 43:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you're fairly certain that
all of this will be lost.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIOVANNI MELCARNE (through
translator): By what we have
seen so far in the past few
months,

43:16.227 --> 43:18.262 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yes.

43:18.262 --> 43:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The bacteria is
Xylella fastidiosa, and for
years has been found in a
variety

43:23.701 --> 43:29.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of plants in Brazil and
California. It is commonly known
as Pierce's disease.

43:29.674 --> 43:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this strain was discovered
two years ago in Italy by Donato
Boscia, a virologist at

43:34.011 --> 43:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the National Research Council in
Bari, while he was visiting his
father-in-law's farm.

43:39.884 --> 43:43.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONATO BOSCIA, Virologist: My
father in law said, "Donato,
please, tomorrow, we can go

43:43.187 --> 43:49.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the field. I want to show you
some abnormal -- of the olive
trees." And I went there and

43:49.894 --> 43:51.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was shocked.

43:51.896 --> 43:56.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first signs
of infection are dried-out
leaves, known as leaf scorching.

43:56.934 --> 44:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eventually, the whole tree
withers. It's thought to have
come to Italy via Costa Rica,
hitching

44:02.240 --> 44:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a ride on a decorative coffee
plant. And it's spread by
insects feeding on tree tissue.

44:08.212 --> 44:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boscia's team is monitoring that
spread by confirming samples,
studying its carriers,

44:15.186 --> 44:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and testing the live bacteria on
various olive subspecies to see
which might be resistant.

44:20.858 --> 44:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONATO BOSCIA: We are sure that
the only tool that we have at
the moment available to try

44:26.864 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prevent the appearance of
this disease, of this quick
decline of olive is try to
prevent

44:33.170 --> 44:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the arrival of the bacteria.

44:36.874 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Italians take
their food very seriously, and
on nearly every table is a

44:41.879 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottle of good olive oil. On
average, Italy trails only Spain
in oil production, responsible

44:47.952 --> 44:52.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for 15 percent of the world's
virgin olive oil and half of
U.S. imports in an industry

44:52.823 --> 44:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that pulls in more than $2
billion a year to the country.

44:57.495 --> 45:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its popularity has only grown,
as it's been touted for a range
of health benefits, including

45:02.466 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reducing the risk of heart
disease. With so much at stake,
for Italy and the rest of
Europe,

45:08.339 --> 45:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the European Union earlier this
year established a buffer zone
to contain the bacteria to one

45:13.010 --> 45:18.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
province in the south, a
controversial move that left
many growers angry.

45:18.249 --> 45:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIOVANNI MELCARNE (through
translator): We are very
dissatisfied. The E.U. is only
interested

45:22.153 --> 45:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in blocking the advance of the
bacteria to the north. This
area, the area of the breakout,

45:25.089 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been left to its fate.

45:27.858 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The measure
required the cutting down of
infected trees and even
seemingly

45:31.596 --> 45:33.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
healthy ones nearby.

45:33.965 --> 45:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIUSEPPE SILLETTI, Regional
Director, Italian Forestry
Service (through translator): My

45:36.067 --> 45:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job would be a lot easier if not
for all the misunderstanding.
Every group has different

45:40.104 --> 45:42.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thoughts on how to
tackle the problem.

45:42.807 --> 45:47.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Giuseppe
Silletti, regional director of
Italy's Forestry Service, is the

45:47.745 --> 45:52.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man tasked with implementing
that plan for the Italian
government and E.U. But he says

45:52.316 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not getting the help
he needs from farmers.

45:55.152 --> 45:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIUSEPPE SILLETTI (through
translator): I have news that
the owners do everything they

45:58.956 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can to hide the disease. If they
have a tree with symptoms, they
prune the plants, so they

46:04.228 --> 46:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look healthy. This is very bad,
because it prevents us from
being able to identify how

46:07.231 --> 46:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much the disease is spreading.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In fact, many
farmers and activists are
skeptical of both the government
response

46:14.038 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the scientific
research on the bacteria.

46:17.808 --> 46:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virologist Donato Boscia was
even accused of introducing the
bacteria into Italy.

46:24.015 --> 46:30.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONATO BOSCIA: Saying to these
people, sorry, but we are, how
to say, a cancer, like that,

46:30.755 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so something that you can not
cure, that your time is limited,
there are -- no therapy,

46:36.127 --> 46:39.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is something that is
difficult to accept.

46:39.363 --> 46:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some, like olive
grower Roberto Polo, believe a
variety of factors, including

46:43.901 --> 46:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pesticides, are to blame.

46:46.437 --> 46:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTO POLO, Olive Grower
(through translator): I believe
that it is not only the bacteria

46:49.907 --> 46:54.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to blame for the rapid drying
out of the olive trees, but a
combination of causes which have

46:54.111 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compromised the immune system of
the trees. In practice, we have
seen a reduction in the

46:57.948 --> 47:01.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ability of the trees to defend
themselves from external attacks
of any kind.

47:01.218 --> 47:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTO ZILETTI, Business Owner:
It's a matter of time. It will
come.

47:03.988 --> 47:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Polo's neighbor,
Roberto Ziletti, owns the Antica
Masseria del Fano, an old

47:09.927 --> 47:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farm that's been converted into
a bed and breakfast with its own
prize-winning olive

47:12.797 --> 47:15.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oil production.

47:15.232 --> 47:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTO ZILETTI: Historically,
there are people that believe
that these things always happen,

47:19.704 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it will -- as it arrives,
it will go away, alone.

47:22.373 --> 47:23.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just naturally.

47:23.774 --> 47:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERTO ZILETTI: Naturally.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:26.911 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTO ZILETTI: I don't know if
this is true. Probably, it's
true, but the matter is that

47:30.314 --> 47:33.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these days the problem
is very, very big.

47:33.084 --> 47:37.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The government
has been attempting to enlist
more cooperation from farmers by

47:37.321 --> 47:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying them to cut down their
own infected trees. That plan
was dealt a blow last month

47:42.259 --> 47:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when a regional Italian court
temporarily halted the removal
of outwardly healthy trees

47:47.465 --> 47:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the infected zone, until the
bacteria could be proven as the
cause of the disease.

47:52.236 --> 47:55.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Researcher Boscia
responds this way:

47:55.106 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONATO BOSCIA: We do not have
the proof that the bacterium
alone can cause the disease,

48:00.978 --> 48:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the disease appear only when
the bacterium arrive there.

48:06.584 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Also unknown is
the incubation period, meaning
many more trees could be
infected

48:10.221 --> 48:13.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and not yet symptomatic.

48:13.057 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIOVANNI MELCARNE (through
translator): In Italy, we have
100 different opinions. But

48:16.961 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is certain is that these
plants are dying, that these
plants are drying, and we don't

48:20.264 --> 48:22.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what the future will be.
And we don't even know that
there's a solution to this

48:22.032 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

48:24.001 --> 48:28.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And there are
already signs the bacteria has
spread farther north, even

48:28.672 --> 48:32.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to France and Corsica, though
not yet infecting olive trees,
suggesting this problem isn't

48:32.943 --> 48:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going anywhere anytime soon.

48:36.347 --> 48:49.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the boot of Southern Italy,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

48:49.960 --> 49:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return to
another one of our "NewsHour"
essays.

49:04.542 --> 49:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Julie Lythcott-Haims, a
former Stanford University
undergraduate dean and author of

49:11.215 --> 49:15.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book "How to Raise an
Adult," shares ideas on her
belief that the job of parents
is to

49:15.419 --> 49:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put themselves out of work.

49:18.823 --> 49:23.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's her perspective on why it
is important to get out of the
overparenting trap.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE LYTHCOTT-HAIMS, Author,
"How to Raise an Adult": We
parents seem to have forgotten

49:25.663 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a simple, unassailable
fact: We're mammals.

49:30.467 --> 49:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sure, we may be mammals with
clothing and cell phones,
but,like our counterparts in

49:35.306 --> 49:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wild, our job as parents is
to put ourselves out of a job,
and raise our kids to be
independent

49:41.579 --> 49:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adults who can raise their own
offspring one day. If you think
about it, it's how we evolved

49:45.783 --> 49:48.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this point as humans.

49:48.586 --> 49:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, these days, too many of us
feel our child simply will not
be successful in life unless

49:54.358 --> 49:58.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we constantly protect and
prevent at every turn, hover
over every happening,
micromanage

49:58.629 --> 50:03.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every moment, take care
of every little thing.

50:03.267 --> 50:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, we can help our kids get a
short-term win when we overhelp,
such as the better grades

50:08.272 --> 50:12.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that come when we remind them to
put their homework in their
backpack, or bring it to

50:12.042 --> 50:17.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school when they have forgotten
it, or outright do some of the
work for them.

50:17.448 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And our overinvolvement
certainly makes life more
pleasant for our kids. Often, we
let

50:21.919 --> 50:26.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them off the hook for doing the
mundane tasks of life, such as
chores, and instead we
prioritize

50:26.790 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their homework and enrichment
activities over all else.

50:31.729 --> 50:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this leads to young adults
who can't do the basic tasks
associated with living life

50:37.067 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their own. A fellow college
dean on another campus told me
of a kid whose parents installed

50:42.306 --> 50:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a webcam in the dorm room in
order to wake their kid up each
morning in college. A student

50:48.145 --> 50:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told me of a friend whose
parents always filled her car
with gas, so she never learned.

50:52.950 --> 50:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then while driving one day
in her 20s, she noticed her tank
was low on fuel, and

50:57.254 --> 51:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she ended up filling the car
with diesel, instead of
unleaded. And some parents are

51:01.659 --> 51:04.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so accustomed to arguing over
grades in high school and
college, that they expect to do

51:04.828 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the same in the workplace.

51:07.364 --> 51:12.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A manager at a prestigious
company told me of hearing from
parents of an employee who

51:12.102 --> 51:16.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were dissatisfied with their --
quote, unquote -- "child"'s
performance review.

51:16.340 --> 51:21.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do parents do that?
Yes, parents do.

51:21.445 --> 51:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, we love our kids with a
driving force we can barely
comprehend. I think of it as

51:27.551 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aching, fierce, terror joy.
Of course, we want the very best
for them. And we love

51:34.024 --> 51:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be needed, and we feel a
great deal of satisfaction when
we ensure that their needs

51:37.795 --> 51:40.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are met.

51:40.698 --> 51:45.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But overhelping can come at a
significant long-term cost to
our kids. It deprives them

51:45.769 --> 51:50.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the chance to build
self-efficacy, a critical aspect
of psychological wellness that
comes

51:50.607 --> 51:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from seeing that one's own
actions lead to outcomes, one's
own actions, not one's parents'

51:55.946 --> 51:59.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actions on one's behalf.

51:59.550 --> 52:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We end up raising kids who fail
to launch, who don't have their
the wherewithal to do

52:03.554 --> 52:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for themselves, and who still
need us to act as the adult in
their lives.

52:08.892 --> 52:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No matter how impressive our
kid's childhood GPA or resume
may be, we have simply not done

52:14.465 --> 52:20.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right by our kids, our society,
our species, if they have
reached the age of chronological

52:20.170 --> 52:30.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adulthood, but don't have the
skills, habits, mind-sets, and
confidence to do for themselves.

52:30.514 --> 52:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: a film about Tyrone
West, who died in Baltimore
police

52:44.028 --> 52:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
custody in the summer of 2013.
The officers were cleared of all
wrongdoing, but the case

52:50.467 --> 52:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is receiving renewed attention
in light of the death of Freddie
Gray. You can find that

52:55.172 --> 52:59.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video on our Facebook page and
our home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:59.977 --> 53:04.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:04.248 --> 53:08.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, we will look at the
future of energy, on the heels
of the Paris climate

53:08.952 --> 53:14.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change agreement. Miles O'Brien
offers a reality check on the
limits of renewable energy and

53:14.958 --> 53:18.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it will take to create a
long-lasting alternative to
fossil fuels.

53:18.262 --> 53:19.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:19.329 --> 53:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:22.366 --> 53:26.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:26.136 --> 54:18.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
