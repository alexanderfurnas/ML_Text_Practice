JUDY WOODRUFF: For more than
35 years, the so-called Gulf
Cooperation Council, or GCC,

00:07.166 --> 00:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has united the nations of
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates,

00:12.933 --> 00:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Oman, the goal, to put the
wealthy, predominantly-Sunni
nations of the Persian
Gulf behind common

00:18.833 --> 00:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cultural, political and
military objectives.

00:21.366 --> 00:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, overnight,
long-simmering tensions
between Qatar and several
of its fellow members, and

00:27.866 --> 00:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
other regional states,
burst into full-fledged
diplomatic crisis.

00:32.300 --> 00:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the
UAE and Egypt, among others,
broke off diplomatic contact

00:38.766 --> 00:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and suspended commercial ties
with the Qatari government.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on these
dramatic developments,
I'm joined by Joyce Karam,
the Washington bureau

00:47.366 --> 00:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chief of Al-Hayat.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's an international
Arabic daily newspaper.

00:50.933 --> 00:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Joyce, thank you very
much for being with us.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why did this happen?

00:56.066 --> 00:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM, Al-Hayat: Well,
as you said, Judy, this is
a very dramatic escalation.

00:58.233 --> 01:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have been covering
tense relations between
Qatar and Saudi Arabia
and the UAE for a while,

01:05.233 --> 01:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it hasn't ever gotten
to the point where they're
not only closing embassies.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're sealing off the border.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're blocking airspace
and maritime access to Qatar.

01:18.466 --> 01:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Qatar, as you know, is
a country smaller than
the state of Connecticut.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's completely dependent
for its food supplies,
for -- 40 percent of
its food supplies come

01:31.433 --> 01:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Saudi Arabia.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is dramatic,
unprecedented escalation.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes at a time where we
are told that both the Saudis
and the Emiratis have had

01:44.833 --> 01:46.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- almost every
alignment in the region, there's
two camps today, if you want

01:52.866 --> 01:54.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

01:54.966 --> 01:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's the pro-Islamist
movement camps, where
Qatar is now boxed in,
and the more closer

02:04.500 --> 02:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this administration, the
Saudi and the Emirati and the
Egyptian camp, and this is

02:10.433 --> 02:12.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
where things are
going from here.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, among other
things, we're hearing that
these five countries are saying

02:14.933 --> 02:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Qatar is too extremist, that
it's been sponsoring terrorism.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Qataris are saying
-- say that's not true.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's really going on?

02:26.366 --> 02:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: Well, it's, again,
this different alignment in
the region post-Arab Spring of

02:32.233 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2011.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Qatar is seen today
as a host leaders from
Hamas, from Taliban.

02:40.333 --> 02:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Actually, just tonight,
the Qatari emir will be
hosting Sheik Kardari
(ph), who is well-known

02:47.666 --> 02:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extremist in the
region, for an iftar.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

02:51.400 --> 02:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
That's an Islamic...

02:53.266 --> 02:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: Islamic cleric.

02:55.933 --> 02:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in that sense, Qatar
is seen as very closed,
has boxed itself in with
these Islamist movements.

03:03.433 --> 03:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this has been a problem
with its relations with Egypt,
with Saudi Arabia and with the

03:10.800 --> 03:12.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Emiratis.

03:12.866 --> 03:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're seeing unfold is
a clash, is a rift within the
GCC on the direction forward,

03:18.233 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether it's in
counterterrorism or other.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we know that
some of these countries that are
accusing Qatar have themselves

03:24.900 --> 03:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at times supported some of
the extremist opposition
forces in Syria, for example.

03:33.133 --> 03:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So is it so clear that Qatar
is doing something different
from what these other countries

03:38.733 --> 03:40.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been doing?

03:40.800 --> 03:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: It's -- I think
Syria is a very complicated
battleground, but, if you look

03:46.900 --> 03:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Syria itself, the main
group that is affiliated
with al-Qaida, formerly
known as Jabhat al-Nusra,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is -- it's supported by Qatar.

03:55.933 --> 04:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- the head of a
group, Julani, gives
interviews on Al-Jazeera.

04:02.933 --> 04:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a Financial Times
story today that Qatar might
have indirectly paid a ransom

04:07.933 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of $1 billion that
went to extremists on
both sides in Syria.

04:14.266 --> 04:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this has become
problematic within the GCC.

04:21.100 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they do feel
bolstered after the Trump
visit to do more on that front.

04:24.433 --> 04:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
countries that have --
because it's true that this
has happened just a week

04:27.533 --> 04:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or two after President Trump
was there in Saudi Arabia.

04:30.733 --> 04:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But -- so, let's quickly talk
about -- Joyce, about how this
affects the region and relations

04:36.733 --> 04:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the U.S. going forward.

04:38.266 --> 04:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: I mean, this is a
very tense time in the region.

04:40.933 --> 04:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an almost Arab cold
war happening within the
Gulf Cooperation Council.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the U.S. tried to
distance itself today a bit.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Pentagon reiterated its
defense relations with Qatar.

04:55.500 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al Udeid Air Base continues to
be active, that the counter-ISIS
effort will not be impacted

05:02.633 --> 05:04.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by this.

05:04.666 --> 05:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we speak also, Judy, I think
the Kuwaitis are trying to
mediate, to find a common ground

05:10.033 --> 05:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the coming hours.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The emir of Kuwait
will be heading to
Saudi Arabia tomorrow.

05:16.700 --> 05:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they can achieve a
breakthrough, you know,
given the list of demands
that Saudi and the

05:23.633 --> 05:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UAE have put together, that
means maybe the citizens of
Qatar will not be expelled from

05:29.766 --> 05:31.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these countries.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unfair to ask
you this question and ask for a
quick answer, but is there fear

05:34.166 --> 05:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this could lead to all-out war?

05:36.600 --> 05:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: I don't think any
side at this point is interested
in a military confrontation.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Qatar, given that
it's a small country, and most
of Qatar's strategic depth

05:49.500 --> 05:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is within the Gulf
region, I don't think
Qatar has an alternative
but to fix this with its

05:58.466 --> 06:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighbors.

06:00.633 --> 06:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Saudi official tells me that
the only way this is -- there
would be an exit is if Qatar

06:10.566 --> 06:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
went away and, you know,
forgot its old habits.

06:17.533 --> 06:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're looking -- they're
looking at a change of behavior
from Qatar, not just demands,

06:21.600 --> 06:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as it happened in 2014.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joyce
Karam, tough subject.

06:25.833 --> 06:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you very
much, with Al-Hayat.

06:26.833 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOYCE KARAM: Thank you.

06:27.833 --> 06:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We appreciate it

06:28.833 --> 06:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: Thank you so much.
