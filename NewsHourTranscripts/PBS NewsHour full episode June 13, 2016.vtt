GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.508 --> 00:11.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: We
hope that our
fellow Americans will not let
fear become

00:11.979 --> 00:13.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disabling.

00:13.747 --> 00:17.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A nation in mourning
searches
for answers. At least 49
innocent people are

00:17.718 --> 00:24.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead and 53 wounded in the worst
mass shooting
in modern American history --
how a gay Orlando

00:24.658 --> 00:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nightclub became a target for
tragedy.

00:27.127 --> 00:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Here at this
center, which
is the hub of the LGBT community
in Orlando,

00:31.331 --> 00:35.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a mixture of sadness,
and anger,
and strength in the face of this
horrendous

00:35.936 --> 00:37.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
act.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
Presidential candidates
weigh in with stark differences
-- how the

00:41.742 --> 00:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
murdering rampage in Florida
will alter the
campaign going forward.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we examine how
Orlando is
sparking a national debate on
gun control

00:52.252 --> 00:53.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and hate crimes.

00:53.887 --> 00:59.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that on
tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:00.027 --> 01:02.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.596 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Orlando, a city that
evokes theme
parks and good times, now also a
blood-stained

01:14.675 --> 01:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entry in American history, 49
people, plus
the killer, slain at a gay
nightclub. Sunday's

01:21.315 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
massacre led today to a search
for motive
and for missed signals.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage in Orlando.

01:28.822 --> 01:32.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There was
relative calm
outside the Pulse nightclub this
morning,

01:32.926 --> 01:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a far remove from the chaos of
24 hours earlier.
Amateur video captured the
terror, gunshots

01:40.067 --> 01:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shattering the party atmosphere
inside the
club.

01:43.737 --> 01:49.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man firing the shots was
29-year-old Omar
Mateen, ultimately killed by a
SWAT team inside.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police said today they have no
regrets about
storming the club.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MINA, Orlando, Florida,
Police Chief:
Based on information we received
from the

01:55.882 --> 02:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspect, and from the hostages,
and people
inside, we believed further loss
of life was

02:04.424 --> 02:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imminent. I made the decision to
commence
the rescue operation and do the
explosive

02:09.896 --> 02:11.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
breach.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During the
attack, Mateen
called 911 dispatchers and
pledged loyalty

02:14.568 --> 02:16.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Islamic State.

02:16.636 --> 02:24.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, ISIS radio released an
audio statement
calling him a soldier of the
caliphate. And

02:24.311 --> 02:28.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
officials in Saudi Arabia
confirmed he'd visited
their country twice for
pilgrimages.

02:28.782 --> 02:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Washington, FBI Director
James Comey
said there's every reason to
think Mateen

02:33.653 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acted on his own.

02:35.489 --> 02:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: There
are strong
indications of radicalization by
this killer

02:39.393 --> 02:45.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of potential inspiration by
foreign terrorist
organizations. So far, we see no
indication

02:45.665 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this was a plot directed
from outside
the United States, and we see no
indication

02:50.637 --> 02:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he was part of any kind of
network.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The FBI had
investigated
Mateen on suspicions of
terrorist sympathies,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but the results were
inconclusive, and Comey
defended his agents' work.

03:00.447 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Our investigation
involved introducing
confidential sources to him,
recording conversations

03:06.520 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with him, following him,
reviewing transactional
records from his communications,
and searching

03:13.293 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all government holdings for any
possible connections,
any possible derogatory
information.

03:18.265 --> 03:22.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As
investigators now searched
the gunman's home in Fort
Pierce, Florida,

03:23.036 --> 03:28.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharply differing images of him
have emerged.
His Afghan-born father
apologized again today

03:28.341 --> 03:30.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the victims.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in a Facebook video,
speaking in Dari,
he reflected on his son and the
crime he committed.

03:34.147 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEDDIQUE MIR MATEEN, Father of
Omar Mateen:
My son Omar a good son and
educated person.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what caused him to
do it. I don't
know what happened. And I didn't
know he had

03:45.192 --> 03:50.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hatred. The issue of
homosexuality and punishment
belongs to God. It doesn't
belong to a servant

03:51.031 --> 03:52.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of Allah

03:52.966 --> 03:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Mateen's
ex-wife painted
a starkly different picture,
saying he was

03:56.536 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abusive, mentally unstable and
full of hate.

03:59.139 --> 04:04.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House, President
Obama spoke
of his own concerns about such
individuals.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
One of the biggest challenges we
are going

04:06.213 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have is this kind of
propaganda and perversions
of Islam that you see generated
on the Internet,

04:16.823 --> 04:24.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the capacity for that to
seep into the
minds of troubled individuals.

04:24.164 --> 04:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
police said today
they have identified nearly all
of the victims,

04:28.201 --> 04:33.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
among them, accountants,
baristas, hairdressers,
people, mostly young, who'd been
looking to

04:33.807 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unwind with a night of music and
dancing.

04:36.943 --> 04:41.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the city's wounds still
fresh, Orlando's
Mayor Buddy Dyer thanked the
city for its

04:41.815 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
response.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BUDDY DYER, Mayor of Orlando,
Florida: We
will not be defined by the act
of a cowardly

04:45.819 --> 04:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hater. We will be defined by how
we respond,
how we treat each other. And
this community

04:51.758 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has already stepped up to do
that.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As the country
awaits the
latest developments in this
investigation,

04:57.030 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a small army of volunteers here
in Orlando
have come to this community
center to do what

05:01.668 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they can to help out.

05:03.603 --> 05:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They loaded food and water today
at Orlando's
biggest LGBT community center,
just minutes

05:08.441 --> 05:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the site of the rampage.
Many said they
came to lend a hand, but also
just to be with

05:13.346 --> 05:15.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others in mourning.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY LYONS, President, Impulse
Orlando: It's
tragic. It's tragic across the
board. We saw

05:18.785 --> 05:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the act of what one person can
do, but in
the same day within 12 hours, we
saw the acts

05:23.990 --> 05:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what many can do together to
really fight
this incident and really try to
come together.

05:28.428 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIE CRUZ, Volunteer: We're
all people,
and it just hurts cause it's
black, white,

05:33.366 --> 05:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gay, no matter what. It doesn't
matter,

05:34.801 --> 05:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's an attack
on everybody.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIE CRUZ: It's just -- yes,
we're all
people, we're all human, and we
-- it's just

05:39.673 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it's hard to deal with.
That's the thing
about the gay community, is, we
all know somebody

05:46.680 --> 05:51.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who knows somebody who knows
somebody, because
this is a close group, and we're
-- it hurts

05:51.318 --> 05:53.119 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us all.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The shooting
happened as
Latin Night at the Pulse
nightclub was winding

05:55.822 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, and a majority of the
victims identified
so far are Hispanic.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Christian Castelan is
Mexican-American and
gay.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN CASTELAN, Volunteer: I
went out
to dinner last night with my
significant other

06:06.566 --> 06:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other friends, and just
being closed to
him, that is even scary, after
what happened,

06:12.839 --> 06:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I was constantly just
looking around.
It just went from completely
comfortable to

06:17.177 --> 06:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just completely fearful in a
matter of hours.
And it just continues to become
much more

06:24.484 --> 06:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult than what it was
yesterday.

06:26.386 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A vigil is
being held later
tonight for the victims of the
shooting. It's

06:32.459 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about less than a mile away from
the nightclub
where they lost their lives --
Gwen.

06:36.529 --> 06:41.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: William, I just
heard that young
man said to say to you that they
went from

06:41.134 --> 06:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being comfortable to terrified
so quickly.
Is it fair to say that the
community is still

06:46.539 --> 06:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a state of shock tonight?

06:48.341 --> 06:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Absolutely. I
mean, the
sense here is that this, like so
many other

06:53.213 --> 06:57.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
communities that have
experienced this type
of a tragedy, the sense of
safety that they

06:57.150 --> 06:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had has been snatched away from
them.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something we heard
not just from
the gay community, but largely
in that community

07:02.756 --> 07:04.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here, all over Orlando.

07:04.658 --> 07:09.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, William, is
there a special
impact in the gay -- if this was
Latin night

07:09.562 --> 07:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a gay nightclub, a special
impact in the
gay and lesbian community?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was,
absolutely.

07:16.002 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the Latino community, as
we know,
it's largely a conservative
community. And

07:21.308 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being gay in the Latino
community is not as
easy as it might be, say, in the
white community.

07:26.579 --> 07:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of people mentioned to
me that there
might be the possibility that
people who were

07:30.684 --> 07:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot, people who might have been
killed or
wounded in this event might not
have been

07:34.621 --> 07:36.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out even to their own families.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now they are forced to
have this conversation
that maybe they weren't ready to
be having,

07:40.060 --> 07:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, oh, I was at this club
when this happened.

07:43.296 --> 07:48.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just raised one more level of
a very, very
uncomfortable conversation for
them at a time

07:48.902 --> 07:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this awful tragedy going on
here.

07:51.104 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And is there
evidence now of heightened
security around, in and around
Orlando, but

07:56.676 --> 07:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
especially in that neighborhood?

07:58.745 --> 08:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Absolutely. We
spent a good
deal of time today and yesterday
at that community

08:03.983 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
center.

08:05.885 --> 08:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now even there every time
they don't let
people stand outside, for fear
of drive-by

08:09.389 --> 08:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shootings. They are checking
bags everywhere
they go. How much of that lasts
after this

08:13.360 --> 08:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event dies down and people start
to go on
with their lives, we don't know.
But there

08:16.963 --> 08:19.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a very strong sense of
security here everywhere.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: William, thank so
much. We will
hear from you again tomorrow
night.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
good night, Gwen.

08:25.405 --> 08:30.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And some
perspective now on
how intelligence and law
enforcement agencies

08:30.677 --> 08:34.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to find and stop people like
the Orlando
killer.

08:34.481 --> 08:40.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We turn to two men with
extensive experience
in counterterrorism operations
and investigations.

08:40.587 --> 08:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Leiter was the director
the National
Counterterrorism center from
2007 to 2011,

08:46.593 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during both the George W. Bush
and Obama administrations.
And Ali Soufan was a supervisory
special agent

08:54.267 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the FBI, where he worked on
both domestic
and international terrorism
investigations.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now runs a security and
intelligence consulting
business.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

09:06.846 --> 09:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Leiter, to you first.
Based on everything
you know, how do you assess the
job that the

09:12.051 --> 09:18.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FBI and other government
agencies did in looking
into what they heard about Omar
Mateen?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER, Former Director,
National
Counterterrorism Center: Well,
let's start

09:20.360 --> 09:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the premise that this is a
very hard
job.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Jim Comey said today, they
not only have
to find needles in a haystack.
They have to

09:26.199 --> 09:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predict which pieces of the way
ill eventually
become needles. I think what
Director Comey

09:31.204 --> 09:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said was that they did a fair
amount of information
of this individual in 2014, to
include running

09:37.777 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operatives against him, doing
surveillance,
doing electronic surveillance.

09:41.714 --> 09:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of that led them to
conclude that
this wasn't a threat. And that
really suggests

09:46.519 --> 09:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me that if there had been
almost anything
there at the time, other than
hearsay, they

09:51.157 --> 09:55.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would have continued the
investigation. So
clearly they didn't predict this
one right.

09:55.228 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's still too early to
know whether
at the time they should have
done more.

09:59.265 --> 10:05.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ali Soufan, in
looking at what
the FBI did, we heard Director
Comey they

10:05.405 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did a 10-month investigation.
What would that
have involved?

10:09.242 --> 10:13.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALI SOUFAN, Former FBI
Interrogator: Well,
I think we heard from Director
Comey that

10:13.780 --> 10:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they put someone undercover,
they put a source
on the individual, they probably
investigated

10:18.818 --> 10:20.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his criminal record.

10:20.854 --> 10:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did probably a thorough
investigation
to see if he is connected to any
ongoing investigation

10:28.027 --> 10:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or any individuals who are
suspected terrorists
or are part of any
investigation. They probably

10:35.602 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
checked his digital footprint.
They saw if
he has contact with suspicious
entities or

10:42.141 --> 10:43.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorist entities.

10:44.077 --> 10:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They probably looked into his
phone record.
And at the time, the assessment
was that he

10:49.916 --> 10:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not connected. And by law,
the FBI has
to close that investigation. If
they can't

10:56.789 --> 11:04.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
articulate that that
investigation, there
is probably a reasonable
suspicion or probable

11:04.631 --> 11:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cause to have the investigation
going, then
they could have had a full
investigation.

11:09.168 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the time, it seems that
there was no
indication whatsoever that that
individual

11:14.941 --> 11:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was involved or connected to
suspected entities.

11:19.279 --> 11:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Leiter,
how much harder
is it to find something on
someone when they

11:25.351 --> 11:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't seem to have a single
allegiance? At
the end, Omar Mateen talked
about ISIS, but,

11:30.456 --> 11:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earlier, his co-workers had said
he talked
about al-Qaida.

11:34.227 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He mentioned the al-Nusra. He
befriended a
man who had gone off to fight
for the al-Nusra

11:40.533 --> 11:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Front. How much more difficult
does that make
it?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: It makes it much
harder.

11:45.605 --> 11:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used to say the U.S. is a
melting pot for
a lot of reasons, including in
the terrorist

11:50.043 --> 11:55.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
minds. Allegiances and
dalliances that would
never occur overseas because of
the purity

11:55.448 --> 11:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to allegiance to Hezbollah vs.
ISIS would
never occur, but here in the
U.S., when you

11:59.852 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a confused and clearly
deranged individual,
searching out almost anything,
almost any

12:05.758 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideology, any group that gives
them a feeling
of worth and ultimately
justifies these horrendous

12:11.864 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acts of violence.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it makes it that much harder,
because you
don't have a clear path to
follow. There isn't

12:17.437 --> 12:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they aren't fitting the mold
that we often
expect to see with other
terrorist groups

12:22.508 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and individuals overseas.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ali Soufan,
should there
be a rethinking of these watch
lists and what

12:28.948 --> 12:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it takes to be on one or be
taken off of one?

12:31.985 --> 12:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI SOUFAN: Well, I think if he
is a subject
of an initial investigation, he
is going to

12:36.990 --> 12:38.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be on a watch list.

12:38.925 --> 12:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that investigation is
closed, he will
be removed off the watch list. I
think Michael

12:46.766 --> 12:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is right in what he mentioned.
We're talking
about an individual, in this
case, for example,

12:52.672 --> 12:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who seems to be so confused.

12:54.641 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, he claims to be a
member of Hezbollah,
which is a Shiite organization.
Another day,

12:59.912 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his family is connected to
al-Qaida. And then
he praised just before he was
killed an individual

13:07.286 --> 13:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was a suicide bomber for
al-Nusra, an
entity that is not in good terms
with ISIS.

13:13.793 --> 13:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he gave his regards and
admiration
for the Boston bombers, two
individuals who

13:20.800 --> 13:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have nothing to do with ISIS.
ISIS in this
case appeared to have no idea
about what this

13:26.439 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guy did. They didn't control his
operation.
They don't appear to be
directing that operation.

13:33.046 --> 13:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even their alleged claim of
responsibility
was based on circular media, was
based on

13:38.851 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they are gathering of U.S.
media regarding
that operation. So now we have a
case of an

13:44.691 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual who went to do his
crime and at
the last second he said, oh, by
the way, I

13:51.330 --> 13:53.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
am ISIS.

13:53.299 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we look at it not as a
hate crime,
but we're looking at it as a
terrorist -- rightly

13:57.136 --> 13:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so, as a terrorist massacre.

13:59.005 --> 14:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael
Leiter, what does
that say for future efforts on
the part of

14:03.843 --> 14:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigators? Because we keep
hearing that
there are hundreds, maybe even
thousands of

14:08.047 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
young people around this
country, mostly young
men, who may be sympathetic, may
hear something

14:13.653 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in ISIS or another of these
groups that they
are interested in. What does it
say about

14:18.324 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future efforts to ferret these
people out
before they do something?

14:22.295 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Judy, you and I
have sat here
after San Bernardino, after
Paris. This is

14:26.365 --> 14:28.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an incredibly hard fight.

14:28.434 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really revolutionized how
we did counterterrorism
post-9/11. And we have gotten so
much better

14:33.172 --> 14:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at working against complex plots
overseas.
But I think we're approaching
the point where

14:37.443 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to seriously consider
how we revolutionize
counterterrorism now to optimize
our ability

14:42.482 --> 14:44.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to find these.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it would require huge
changes. It would
require a lowering of the bar to
do surveillance

14:48.688 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in certain operations. That is
out canning
against the grain of the
post-Snowden era.

14:53.126 --> 14:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would require a huge increase
in resources,
both for the FBI and state and
local law enforcement.

14:57.997 --> 15:02.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it might also require
diminishing the
ability to obtain firearms.

15:02.769 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are all big choices. And
as tragic as
this is, it still isn't clear to
me that we

15:07.740 --> 15:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the political will to go
down that path.

15:09.675 --> 15:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that, Ali Soufan?
What does it take to make the
efforts of law

15:15.715 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enforcement more successful at
finding these
people before they act?

15:19.352 --> 15:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI SOUFAN: Well, I think, first
of all, I
agree with what Michael said.

15:24.991 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, since 9/11, we have been
very successful
tactically in combating the
threat. Unfortunately,

15:31.864 --> 15:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to the ideology,
we haven't
been that successful. We have
been behind

15:35.835 --> 15:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the eight-ball. We didn't do
much to counter
the incubating factors that is
leading into

15:41.073 --> 15:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. We haven't been countering
the ideology
and countering the narrative as
we should

15:45.912 --> 15:47.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
online.

15:47.880 --> 15:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we need to develop
some kind of
21st century policing model
where we can include

15:52.418 --> 15:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the community inside the pipe,
that they feel
that they are part of the
solution, not part

15:56.589 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the problem, not to say that
specific communities
around the nation haven't been
working very

16:01.861 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
closely with law enforcement.

16:04.363 --> 16:09.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, most of the
disruptions that
took place in the last few
years, significant

16:09.368 --> 16:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number was based on tips from
the community.
But I think we need to develop a
21st century

16:14.841 --> 16:23.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policing model that includes a
way to, you
know, promote the idea of, if
you see something,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say something, in specific
communities around
the United States.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ali Soufan,
Michael Leiter,
we thank you both.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Thank you.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI SOUFAN: Thank you.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
now to Capitol
Hill and how lawmakers are
responding to the

16:37.063 --> 16:38.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attack in Orlando.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with Senator Dianne
Feinstein, a
Democrat from California. She is
the ranking

16:43.603 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
member of the Intelligence
Committee.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Feinstein, welcome back
to the "NewsHour."

16:48.908 --> 16:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if you have been
able to hear
the conversation we have just
been having.

16:52.345 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But based on what you know, is
it your sense
that law enforcement
intelligence agencies

16:59.518 --> 17:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did everything they could to do
something
about this man, Omar Mateen,
before this happened?

17:06.392 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: Well,
first of all, Judy, I have great
respect both

17:09.428 --> 17:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Mike Leiter and Ali Soufan.
So, I very
much agree with what they have
had to say.

17:16.335 --> 17:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With respect of dealing with the
classic lone
wolf, we are, I think, seeing
the real problem.

17:24.243 --> 17:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one thing that came out
of all of
this that I thought was good is
that the Islamic

17:30.983 --> 17:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, and particularly the
religious
part of that community, is
beginning to stand

17:35.888 --> 17:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, take notice and say, no,
this is not us,
and say it over and over and
over again.

17:42.895 --> 17:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this last perpetrator that
really did
such a dastardly event by
striking at a lesbian

17:52.705 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gay community that has
struggled for equality
over so many years, and now to
have them subject

17:59.946 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this kind of terrible event
is just really
awful.

18:05.084 --> 18:12.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, I think that,
as time goes
on, we're going to increasingly
realize, as

18:12.992 --> 18:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali spoke about, Ali Soufan
spoke about, of
how we get a countermessage out
in a way that

18:19.832 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is effective.

18:21.667 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think law enforcement has
responded. As
far as I know, this country is
responding

18:26.839 --> 18:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with full resources. The FBI has
sent an additional
complement of men, of 80 men and
women, into

18:36.015 --> 18:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Florida. They have a big number
already in
Florida.

18:41.120 --> 18:47.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are leading the
investigation. Everybody
is cooperating. And I think the
investigation

18:48.094 --> 18:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to be going very well. How
you stop
this doesn't seem to be going
very well. This

18:55.401 --> 19:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a man, nine years employed,
good job, semi-law
enforcement, wanted law
enforcement, went

19:04.076 --> 19:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to mosques, prayed, and somehow
became so
alienated.

19:09.415 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, whether this is from social
media, whether
it's from contact, or whether
it's really

19:16.856 --> 19:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a displaced aggression, I don't
know. But
this is a big problem. And we're
going to

19:23.295 --> 19:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be stuck with it for a very long
time, I believe.

19:26.699 --> 19:32.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I want
to ask you
about the fact that you are one
of those in

19:32.838 --> 19:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate who is pushing this
legislation
to prevent individuals on a
terror watch list

19:39.011 --> 19:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from buying, obtaining a firearm
or explosives.

19:43.516 --> 19:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think you may have
some success
with that now, when it's been
impossible to

19:49.388 --> 19:51.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pass in the past?

19:51.257 --> 19:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, I
think people
are beginning to realize that
the attorney

19:58.230 --> 20:05.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general should have the ability
to place people
on the terrorist watch list and
deny sale

20:05.538 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of weapons to them.

20:07.440 --> 20:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this bill essentially gives
the attorney
general those regulations in
law. In other

20:15.314 --> 20:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
words, she can move to take
action. And that
is what this bill does. I think
it's very,

20:22.188 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very important.

20:24.056 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, on another subject, the
AR-15, this
is a military-style assault
weapon, in its

20:30.896 --> 20:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
truest sense of the word, big
bullets, terrible
physical damage. Look at the
death rate, and

20:38.237 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think more of that will come
out.

20:40.906 --> 20:49.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not to take action -- we tried
after Sandy
Hook. We failed. I tried after
San Bernardino

20:49.281 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to get this no guns for
terrorists through.
We failed. This Congress has to
realize that

20:57.723 --> 21:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they need to step up and we need
to protect
people now.

21:01.861 --> 21:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have got a full
component of
law enforcement. I think we have
got relatively

21:06.665 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good intelligence. As Director
Comey told
us, there is an investigation
going on in

21:12.505 --> 21:13.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every state.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, two
things.

21:16.375 --> 21:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Omar Mateen -- Omar Mateen,
as you know,
wasn't on a watch list in the
most recent

21:22.481 --> 21:27.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past. So he wouldn't have been
prevented from
buying a weapon. But, second of
all, the argument

21:27.720 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that many of your Republican
colleagues have
made about this is that there is
still the

21:32.124 --> 21:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential that people who are
innocent are
on a watch list, and they would
be prevented

21:36.428 --> 21:38.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from buying a gun.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well,
then you can
petition and prove that you are
innocent and

21:42.801 --> 21:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get off of the watch list.

21:44.603 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, if we want to
prevent this
-- you know, this bill was
drafted actually

21:51.977 --> 21:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the Bush administration
when a man,
a terrorist, went back to Syria,
an American,

21:59.385 --> 22:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said to everybody, now
exploit the loopholes
in America's laws, and you buy
weapons.

22:06.992 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this is -- we have got
huge loopholes.
And it's wrong. And we have got
to begin to

22:13.599 --> 22:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close them one by one by one.
The terrorist
bill, no guns for terrorists, is
the first

22:19.939 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step. Assault weapons is the
second step.
This man shouldn't have been
able -- if he

22:26.111 --> 22:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been on the terrorist watch
list, he wouldn't
have been able to buy that
assault weapon.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's important.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Dianne
Feinstein, we
thank you.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thank
you, Judy.

22:38.724 --> 22:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we get a
Republican
perspective now from Congressman
Will Hurd

22:43.662 --> 22:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Texas. He's on the House
Committee on Homeland
Security. He previously served
as an undercover

22:49.668 --> 22:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer for the CIA in the
Middle East and
South Asia.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Hurd, thank you for
being with
us. I don't know if you heard,
but Senator

22:57.743 --> 23:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dianne Feinstein just said that
it's time
for Congress to step up in the
wake of this

23:02.881 --> 23:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
horrible incident in Orlando.

23:05.251 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you know, she and other
senators are
promoting legislation that would
make it impossible

23:11.490 --> 23:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for someone on a terror watch
list to buy
a weapon.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Hurd, are you able
to hear me?

23:21.433 --> 23:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. WILL HURD (R), Texas: Yes.
Yes. Yes,
Judy.

23:24.169 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen, nobody is supporting
putting weapons
in the hands of terrorists. But
the reality

23:29.608 --> 23:34.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, it's unfortunate when an
event like what
happened in Orlando, both sides
of the political

23:34.613 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aisle retreat to some of the
same tired talking
points.

23:39.351 --> 23:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill that the good senator
from California
was talking about wouldn't have
prevented

23:43.956 --> 23:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happened in Orlando. It
wouldn't have
prevented what happened in San
Bernardino.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, on a no-fly list
-- if you
are on a no-fly list now and you
try to buy

23:53.098 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a weapon, that information goes
to the FBI,
and the FBI has influence on
whether that

23:57.970 --> 23:59.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sale is able to go through or
not.

24:00.005 --> 24:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, is what we need
to be focused
on here is focusing on taking
the fight to

24:04.877 --> 24:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the doorsteps of terrorists,
whether it's
ISIS, al-Qaida, Lashkar-e-Taiba,
Boko Haram.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to take the fight to
them.

24:11.750 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also need to make sure
that we are
countering that ideology . The
two gentlemen

24:15.587 --> 24:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier were talking about this.
What makes
ISIS so dangerous is its ability
to inspire

24:21.794 --> 24:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, even if they are 6,000
miles away
and they have never met them.

24:25.230 --> 24:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are a country that has the
most creative
minds, the best brands. We
should be all working

24:29.668 --> 24:34.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
together to counter this
ideology. And the
third thing we need to be doing
is making

24:34.440 --> 24:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that we have national
intelligence information
in the hands of local law
enforcement. We

24:39.611 --> 24:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see what happened in Orlando and
San Bernardino,
that it was local law
enforcement that has

24:45.417 --> 24:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to respond to these kind of
activities.

24:47.753 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I started in the CIA,
it was before
9/11. And have I seen how
intelligence-sharing

24:52.591 --> 24:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has improved significantly from
that time
to now. The next step is making
sure we're

24:57.796 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting the right information in
the hands
of local law enforcement.

25:00.299 --> 25:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Congressman,
why wouldn't
it be another important tool in
the hands

25:06.238 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of law enforcement to be able to
say if someone's
on a watch list, if they are
being investigated

25:11.343 --> 25:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for something they did or are
suspected of
doing, that they should at least
during that

25:16.582 --> 25:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
period not be allowed to buy a
weapon or explosives?

25:19.084 --> 25:19.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REP. WILL HURD: Well...

25:20.052 --> 25:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is that
objectionable?

25:21.887 --> 25:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. WILL HURD: Again, the
failsafe is there
if you are on the no-fly list.
If are you

25:25.524 --> 25:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on the no-fly, the FBI is
reviewing that
information.

25:29.294 --> 25:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, is a weapon is
just a tool.
Whether you use a long gun, a
handgun or explosives,

25:37.736 --> 25:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these are tools in the hands of
a terrorist.
And if you are that deranged
that you are

25:42.908 --> 25:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to kill 49 innocent
people and take
your own life, then are you
going to get that

25:47.413 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tool however you can in order to
do your deed.

25:50.582 --> 25:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the important thing
that we need
to be focusing on is what I just
said. Take

25:55.554 --> 25:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fight to them and make sure
that we're
countering that ideology. And
that is where

26:00.025 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- there is not going to be any
one piece
of legislation that prevents
another Orlando

26:04.897 --> 26:06.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from happening.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to be a lot of work.
This is something
that has been going on and that
the House

26:09.401 --> 26:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been looking at for the last
15 months.
I sat on a task force that
looked at four

26:14.306 --> 26:19.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and five years going into Iraq
and Syria.
And we have had nine pieces of
legislation

26:19.711 --> 26:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that tightens up loopholes in
our visa process
to make sure that we are still
allowing commerce

26:25.851 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and people to move back and
forth, but it's
making sure that we're having
all the tools

26:29.688 --> 26:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and information in the hands of
people that
are issuing the visas.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is a long-term fight.

26:34.393 --> 26:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman, is
there any additional
restriction on the ability of
individuals

26:40.098 --> 26:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are being investigated, who
may have committed
a crime or maybe thinking about
a terrorist

26:45.771 --> 26:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
act, who have been proven in
some way, or
who law enforcement has a reason
to be concerned

26:51.543 --> 26:56.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, is there any additional
restriction
that you would be willing to go
along with

26:56.715 --> 27:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to strengthen the hands
of law enforcement
in this country, where, as you
say, there

27:01.987 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a worry that people may be
committing an
act in sympathy with ISIS or
another terror

27:07.726 --> 27:09.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group?

27:09.595 --> 27:13.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. WILL HURD: Well, the
reality is, there
has been a lot of focus on the
Orlando killer

27:13.565 --> 27:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how they were interviewed
three times
by the FBI.

27:17.169 --> 27:22.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The FBI had a 10-month
investigation. They
ran undercover officers against
him. And they

27:22.608 --> 27:27.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found out he wasn't connected in
any form
or fashion. It's not breaking
the law to be

27:27.412 --> 27:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interviewed by the FBI. The FBI
has a difficult
task. And this lone wolf
scenario is one of

27:34.319 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hardest things for law
enforcement to
fight against.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we need to make
sure we're
doing everything we can to get
information

27:41.360 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their hands. So, you know,
this is the
time that we should be working
together, across

27:46.932 --> 27:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the aisle on making sure that
we're focused
on the real issue.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Will
Hurd, we thank
you very much.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. WILL HURD: Thank you.

27:55.807 --> 28:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
devoting the
rest of this program to killing
in Orlando,

28:01.213 --> 28:03.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

28:03.215 --> 28:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in the day's
other news: An
Indiana man is jailed in Santa
Monica, California,

28:08.720 --> 28:13.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after police arrested him
Sunday, heavily
armed and headed to a gay pride
parade. James

28:13.959 --> 28:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Howell will appear in court
tomorrow. Police
say he was carrying three
assault rifles and

28:20.065 --> 28:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chemicals used in explosives.

28:22.034 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Supreme
Court rebuffed
Puerto Rico today over its debt
crisis. The

28:27.372 --> 28:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court ruled federal law bars the
commonwealth
from restructuring part of the
$70 billion

28:33.045 --> 28:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it owes. Instead, it must wait
for Congress
to finish debt relief
legislation.

28:39.017 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The justices also refused to
freeze federal
curbs on power plant emissions
of mercury.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Twenty states wanted the rules
delayed.

28:47.526 --> 28:52.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In Iraq, the
government says it's
investigating reports that
Shiite militias

28:52.931 --> 28:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have killed Sunni men escaping
from Fallujah.
The Shiites are supporting an
Iraqi army offensive

28:59.104 --> 29:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to retake the city from Islamic
State fighters.
Iraqi troops have been slowly
advancing into

29:05.844 --> 29:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fallujah for three weeks now.
Over the weekend,
4,000 civilians managed to
escape.

29:11.116 --> 29:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city of
Marseille, France,
was rocked by soccer violence
over the weekend

29:16.622 --> 29:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Russian and English fans
at the European
Championship tournament.
European soccer's

29:22.427 --> 29:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governing body warned both
sides, but a court
handed down prison terms for
only one side.

29:28.500 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emma Murphy of Independent
Television News
reports from Marseille.

29:32.237 --> 29:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: That they were
organized, determined,
and extremely violent was
obvious to anyone

29:38.076 --> 29:41.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who saw the violence in
Marseille this weekend.

29:41.279 --> 29:46.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the French authorities have
admitted a
gang of 150 known Russian
hooligans managed

29:46.151 --> 29:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get into the country, and
indeed the stadium,
to foment three days of
brutality. Not one

29:53.158 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been arrested.

29:55.227 --> 29:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Describing them as ultra-rapid,
ultra-violent
and extremely well-trained,
Marseille's prosecutor

30:00.098 --> 30:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acknowledged some had been
stopped at the
airport, but the rest breached
French security

30:05.070 --> 30:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and are free to infiltrate other
games.

30:08.874 --> 30:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The hooligans from Russia
traveled from other
countries on trains and in
cars," he told

30:16.581 --> 30:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. "We would have known and
arrested them
had they come through the
airport."

30:20.085 --> 30:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians were the most
organized and violent,
but it was the English fans who
were in court

30:25.524 --> 30:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, six in all arrested for
violence.

30:28.360 --> 30:33.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the course of the
weekend, 35 people
were injured, four seriously.
These scenes

30:33.198 --> 30:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to UEFA's threat to throw
both England
and Russia out of the
tournament. Today, England's

30:38.970 --> 30:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manager and captain, Wayne
Rooney, appealed
to fans for no repeat.

30:41.573 --> 30:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROY HODGSON, English Soccer
Manager: I'm appealing
to you to stay out of trouble
and try and

30:45.677 --> 30:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make certain these threats that
are being
issued are never carried out.

30:50.615 --> 30:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAYNE ROONEY, English Soccer
Captain: I would
like to ask the fans, please, if
you don't

30:53.185 --> 30:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a ticket, don't travel. And
for the fans
with tickets, be safe, be
sensible.

30:56.855 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: This city is now
calm for the
first time in three days. And
with today's

31:01.660 --> 31:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentences, it seems the French
authorities
are keen to send out a strong
message to deter

31:06.998 --> 31:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
others from violent actions.

31:09.034 --> 31:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, with no Russians in
custody, that
message is significantly
weakened.

31:13.672 --> 31:19.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The French
prosecutor says
police are studying
closed-circuit TV footage,

31:19.478 --> 31:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and trying to track down the
Russians involved
in the violence.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Microsoft made a
surprise move
today and announced it is buying
the professional

31:27.519 --> 31:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
networking site LinkedIn. The
price tag? More
than $26 billion. It's the
largest acquisition

31:33.825 --> 31:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Microsoft's history, and it
gives the software
giant access to LinkedIn's 430
million members.

31:40.932 --> 31:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The sell-off that
hit Wall
Street late last week carried
over to today.

31:45.637 --> 31:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
133 points to close at 17732.
The Nasdaq fell

31:51.243 --> 31:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
46 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 17.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Broadway musical
"Hamilton"
and the Pittsburgh Penguins now
have something

31:54.980 --> 31:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in common: Both are big winners.
Pittsburgh
took the National Hockey League
title last

31:56.815 --> 31:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, beating the San Jose
Sharks in six
games. It's the fourth Stanley
Cup in the

31:57.415 --> 31:59.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
franchise's history.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And "Hamilton," the hip-hop
stage biography
of former Treasury Secretary
Alexander Hamilton,

32:01.052 --> 32:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won 11 Tony Awards, including
best musical.
That's one shy of the record.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
issue calls

32:05.090 --> 32:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to action in response to the
Orlando shooting;
plus, a look at the prejudice
the LGBT community

32:09.327 --> 32:13.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
still faces.

32:13.265 --> 32:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to
politics.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presidential candidates Hillary
Clinton and
Donald Trump both scaled back
scheduled campaign

32:26.611 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events today in the wake of the
Orlando shooting.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both responded to the tragedy,
in very different
ways.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Today is not a day for politics.

32:36.888 --> 32:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, Americans woke up to
a nightmare
that's become mind-numbingly
familiar, another

32:45.263 --> 32:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
act of terrorism in a place no
one expected.
This is a moment when all
Americans need to

32:53.171 --> 33:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand together. No matter how
many times we
endure attacks like this, the
horror never

33:00.912 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fades. The murder of innocent
people breaks
our hearts, tears at our sense
of security,

33:09.921 --> 33:11.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and makes us furious.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The bottom line is that Hillary
supports policies

33:15.026 --> 33:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that bring the threat of radical
Islam into
America and allow it to grow
overseas, and

33:20.365 --> 33:22.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is growing.

33:22.367 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Hillary Clinton's
catastrophic immigration
plan will bring vastly more
radical Islamic

33:29.007 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration into this country,
threatening
not only our society, but our
entire way of

33:35.747 --> 33:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life. We need a new leader. We
need a new
leader fast. They have put
political correctness

33:42.287 --> 33:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above common sense, above your
safety, and
above all else. I refuse to be
politically

33:49.394 --> 33:49.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
correct.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:51.963 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
candidates' response
to the deadly shooting in
Orlando, we turn

33:56.401 --> 34:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Politics Monday, with Amy
Walter of The
Cook Political Report and Tamara
Keith of

34:01.573 --> 34:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NPR, who is joining us tonight
from Cleveland.

34:04.175 --> 34:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, both candidates said this
wasn't a day
for politics, and Hillary
Clinton didn't mention

34:09.214 --> 34:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump by name. But she
still slid in
her little digs.

34:13.251 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.
And Donald Trump mentioned
Hillary Clinton

34:16.321 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explicitly many times during the
debate -- during
his press conference today.

34:21.192 --> 34:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think the candidates
that you saw
today giving speeches in
response to Orlando

34:25.797 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't any different from the
candidates that
you see on the campaign trail.
You had, in

34:29.467 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, the bold, the
brash, the controversial.
He doubled down on the Muslim
ban. Talked

34:35.874 --> 34:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about sort of an us vs. them
look at the world.

34:39.077 --> 34:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, much more
measured, much
more traditional, political and
she talked

34:44.716 --> 34:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about a we vs. me mentality.

34:47.018 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for anybody who is sort of
on the fence
about this campaign, who says I
don't really

34:51.523 --> 34:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know the differences between
these two candidates,
how would they react to a crisis
situation

34:57.262 --> 35:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a big event as president of
the United
States, you got a very clear
idea of the differences

35:03.168 --> 35:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the two of them today.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, but Donald
Trump didn't just
double down on what he has said
before about

35:08.940 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banning Muslims. He talked today
about banning
entire nationalities.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Right,
he said -- and this was an
expansion -- that

35:15.914 --> 35:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would put a temporary ban on
immigration
from countries that support
terrorism or where

35:24.189 --> 35:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism against America has
originated,
which could include a whole lot
of countries.

35:29.527 --> 35:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have details on which
those would
be. He also in that speech said
that Hillary

35:35.934 --> 35:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton wants to do away with
the Second Amendment,
take away people's guns and
allow terrorists

35:42.273 --> 35:45.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the country and then people
wouldn't
be able to defend themselves.
That, of course,

35:45.643 --> 35:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not Hillary Clinton's policy.
But there
you have it.

35:50.615 --> 35:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, it seems to me
that at least
the Democrats have their talking
points in

35:55.920 --> 36:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order. The president did this
with us on our
"NewsHour" town hall not long
ago, talking

36:01.226 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about terror watch lists and how
Congress
should at least allow them to
deny gun purchases

36:08.633 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to people on the watch lists.

36:10.435 --> 36:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Dianne Feinstein say it
again just
now to Judy. And we heard
Hillary Clinton

36:14.606 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say it. So, is that the line,
that the Democrats
will always talk about guns and
the Republicans

36:19.511 --> 36:20.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will always talk about
immigration?

36:21.012 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That seems to be
the way this
keeps happening.

36:26.518 --> 36:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should note that this is
not the first
time that these presidential
candidates have

36:31.189 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to respond to a terrorist
incident. This
one happens to be bigger and
here at home.

36:38.797 --> 36:44.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the response has been
essentially the
same each time. Hillary Clinton
this time

36:44.102 --> 36:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about wanting to
possibly expand
terror lists.

36:48.206 --> 36:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, essentially, it is the same
conversation
about guns and about terrorism.
And it goes

36:53.945 --> 36:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
round and round and round again.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the sort of depressing piece
about all
of this is, they are talking
about legislation

37:00.485 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is unlikely to get anywhere
within Congress,
whether it's more attempts to
control guns,

37:07.992 --> 37:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, you know, to have more
regulation around
guns, or whether it is about
banning Muslims

37:12.697 --> 37:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or people who are coming in, as
Tam pointed
out, from countries that support
terrorism.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are things that aren't
going to make
it through Congress.

37:19.471 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What is unique about
Donald Trump
is that he starts every response
by saying,

37:23.341 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see, I was right.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, see, I was
right.

37:26.077 --> 37:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he also said, I can do these
things on
banning certain people through
my own orders.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I won't need Congress to be able
to do that.

37:34.385 --> 37:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Tam, do we -- I
know we say
this a lot. But I'm curious
whether moments

37:38.323 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this, kind of somber, big
moments, represent
that a turning point, or at
least a clarifying

37:43.695 --> 37:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point in a campaign, especially
as we get
ready to turn to the general
election.

37:47.966 --> 37:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: This is absolutely
one of those
moments, just like Paris, just
like San Bernardino.

37:54.672 --> 37:59.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Those were moments in the
campaign where we
all paused and we thought that
this could

37:59.944 --> 38:01.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a defining moment.

38:01.913 --> 38:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we don't know -- those
previous incidents
were defining moments. Donald
Trump came out

38:06.551 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong. He talked about a Muslim
ban. He did
better among Republican voters
after those

38:11.890 --> 38:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incidents. His poll numbers
improved.

38:14.125 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we don't know this time
around is whether
it's different. You know what? A
Republican

38:18.663 --> 38:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary electorate is very
different from
a general election electorate.
There are a

38:23.601 --> 38:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot more people who have very
different views.
And it is just not clear at this
point.

38:30.542 --> 38:35.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a moment. We don't know
quite what the
moment means in terms of how
this will play

38:35.380 --> 38:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out over the next several weeks
and months.

38:37.215 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
terminology,
because one of the things that
Donald Trump

38:41.019 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is counting on is that in the
past this has
worked for him, this really
tough response.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

38:47.292 --> 38:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But now, today, he
was talking
a lot about she won't use the
words radical

38:51.062 --> 38:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamism. And she said, well, I
do too kind
of.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is that really about?

38:57.936 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, it seems that
what Hillary
Clinton was trying to do, at
least this morning

39:01.573 --> 39:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- she didn't do it in her
speech today -- but
by taking the issue radical
Islam, radical

39:07.312 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jihadism and sort of saying, I
can do either
or both of those, and say, I
don't want to

39:11.816 --> 39:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get in a debate over semantics.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would rather get in a debate
over what is
happening in this country with
individuals

39:17.822 --> 39:24.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are using faith to do
terrible things.
In the past, though, she has
said we don't

39:24.162 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to call it radical Islam,
because then
we are maligning entire -- an
entire religion.

39:29.634 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want to focus on the
religious part.
We want to focus on the actions.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in essence, what they
are trying
to do -- and I don't know if
this is correct.

39:36.507 --> 39:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in essence, what they are
trying to do
is to say, you know, look, this
issue is not

39:42.247 --> 39:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something I want to get in a
fight about anymore.
I think it's getting tougher and
tougher for

39:46.317 --> 39:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to try and take parse these
words and
to defend not taking on Muslim
religion, and

39:52.090 --> 39:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead start where Donald Trump
does and
say, we're not going to go as
far as he does

39:56.894 --> 39:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of banning all Muslims.

39:58.763 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Tam, I want to
talk about
another piece of terminology,
which is the

40:02.667 --> 40:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LGBT community, we heard Donald
Trump say
today, I'm a better -- I will be
a better

40:06.738 --> 40:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friend because I will act and
Hillary just
has words.

40:10.541 --> 40:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that actually true? Does it
seem that way?
It seems to me the big groups
have endorsed

40:15.246 --> 40:17.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton already.

40:17.181 --> 40:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The big groups
have endorsed
Hillary Clinton already. And she
is very popular

40:22.820 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among some large portion of the
LGBT community.

40:26.591 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump, though,
interestingly, you know,
has not wanted to fight in fight
in that arena.

40:33.398 --> 40:38.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other candidates who
were running
in the Republican primary who
wanted to talk

40:38.269 --> 40:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about gay marriage and wanted to
talk about
bathroom laws. And Donald Trump
has, generally

40:43.274 --> 40:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speaking, taken a more tolerant
view.

40:46.811 --> 40:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That seems to be an area that he
doesn't want
to get into too much.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Not on gay marriage.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Not on gay
marriage, for instance.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Right. OK, on gay
marriage, he
is, I think, in line with the
Republican Party.

40:58.690 --> 41:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, Tam Keith, we're done here.
Amy Walter,
we're done here.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We're done, for now.

41:04.896 --> 41:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you both.

41:10.501 --> 41:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

41:15.006 --> 41:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

41:19.477 --> 41:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president has
called the shootings
not just an act of terror, but
also an act

41:26.451 --> 41:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hate. This is not the first
time that members
of the LGBT community have been
targets, but

41:31.823 --> 41:36.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the wake of decades of
progress and acceptance,
it is resonating differently
now.

41:36.961 --> 41:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine that with Rachel
Tiven, the incoming
CEO of Lambda Legal, a national
organization

41:42.367 --> 41:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which works for the civil rights
of lesbians,
gay men, bisexuals and
transgender people,

41:48.206 --> 41:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Mark Potok of the Southern
Poverty Law
Center, which closely monitors
hate crimes

41:52.877 --> 41:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and threats throughout the
United States.

41:55.313 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Potok, I want to start by
asking for
a definition here. What is a
hate crime?

42:00.885 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK POTOK, Southern Poverty Law
Center: Well,
the definitions are a bit fuzzy,
because,

42:04.822 --> 42:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, there are many state
laws that
all express it differently.

42:08.092 --> 42:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, essentially, a hate crime
is a crime
that is motivated in whole or in
part by bias

42:14.165 --> 42:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against a particular named class
of people,
LGBT people, black people, white
people, certain

42:21.773 --> 42:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
religions and so on. It is
generally different,
I think, than terrorism, in the
sense that

42:26.844 --> 42:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is not a kind of public
display crime.

42:30.848 --> 42:36.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can happen in private with no
notice at
all. So it's not the kind of
crime that is

42:36.220 --> 42:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carried out in order to send a
message to
thousands of people, as
terrorist crimes are,

42:42.193 --> 42:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or to change the way an entire
community acts.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rachel Tiven, is it
significant,
or was it significant to you to
hear the president

42:49.033 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States immediately
go to the
word hate in describing what he
saw happen

42:55.239 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Orlando?

42:57.074 --> 43:00.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL TIVEN, Incoming CEO,
Lambda Legal:
Absolutely, because it is
important for the

43:00.111 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president to acknowledge the
victims here.

43:03.514 --> 43:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to talk about the
victims. The
victims of this crime were LGBT
Latinos and

43:09.320 --> 43:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their friends and their allies.
And that -- seeing
that either be lost in this
conversation or,

43:17.428 --> 43:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worse, be appropriated by people
who have
sought to harm LGBT people in
the past is

43:24.569 --> 43:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really bitter and hollow at this
time.

43:27.405 --> 43:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, could you
expand on that
a little bit? What is
significant -- specifically

43:30.942 --> 43:36.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant about the fact that
the targets
in this case were Latinos, gays
and lesbians?

43:37.048 --> 43:43.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL TIVEN: What is
significant is that
this wasn't an accidental
target, right?

43:43.721 --> 43:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The perpetrator of this crime
didn't happen
to be walking by and choose this
target by

43:51.062 --> 43:57.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accident. We have heard that --
from his father
that he harbored significant
animosity toward

43:57.134 --> 44:03.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LGBT people, and that that may
have been -- when
we find out from the FBI more
about his motives,

44:03.741 --> 44:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that may have been a part of the
narrative.

44:06.177 --> 44:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we don't even need to ask
what the motive
was. When you target a gay club,
a place that

44:12.817 --> 44:18.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LGBT people go to congregate and
murder the
people who are there,
unfortunately, that

44:18.523 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is an act that speaks for
itself.

44:20.491 --> 44:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark Potok, I know
you keep track
of hate crimes around the
country, and I wonder

44:25.296 --> 44:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you -- in your records, how
much more does
this happen -- or does it happen
more with

44:32.403 --> 44:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LGBT people than other people?
How much of
a target is that community?

44:37.041 --> 44:39.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK POTOK: Very much so.

44:39.777 --> 44:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We looked actually at 14 years
of FBI data,
hate crime data, and made
comparisons to the

44:46.684 --> 44:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size of the populations of
various minority
groups in this country. And to
make a very

44:52.256 --> 44:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long story short, what we found
was that,
on a per capita basis, at least
in recent

44:58.629 --> 45:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, LGBT people are targeted
for violent
hate crimes at a rate of two
times that of

45:10.207 --> 45:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gay -- I'm sorry -- of Muslims
or black people,
four times that of Jews, and 14
times that

45:19.383 --> 45:21.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Latinos.

45:21.319 --> 45:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the bottom line is that LGBT
people really
are targeted in a way that no
other minority

45:27.124 --> 45:32.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group or at a rate higher than
any other minority
group in this country, at least
in recent

45:32.663 --> 45:33.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

45:33.130 --> 45:34.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:35.099 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK POTOK: I think maybe it's
worth pointing
out that, just three years ago,
on New Year's

45:38.135 --> 45:48.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eve of 2013 in Seattle, a man
tried to burn
alive 750 people in an upstairs
gay club there

45:48.412 --> 45:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Neighbours. He wasn't
successful. Quick-thinking
patrons discovered the fire in
the stairwell

45:54.385 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and put it out.

45:55.953 --> 46:00.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there might well have been
an enormous
casualty list in that case.

46:00.257 --> 46:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rachel Tiven, is
this, any of
this, in your observation,
opinion, backlash

46:07.131 --> 46:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the gains that LGBT
people have made
in recent years, including
marriage?

46:13.037 --> 46:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL TIVEN: Unfortunately, we
have seen
backlash.

46:17.074 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen that, in the past
year, more
than 200 bills have been
introduced by state

46:23.147 --> 46:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legislatures and localities
around the country,
not just in a couple of states,
seeking to

46:29.253 --> 46:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strip LGBT people of equal
rights, seeking
to avoid protection from
discrimination for

46:36.494 --> 46:38.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LGBT people.

46:38.829 --> 46:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen lies, right? We
have seen
lies about who LGBT people are.
We have seen

46:45.670 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state legislatures say that
there is a danger
to washing your hands in a
bathroom next to

46:53.911 --> 46:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a transgender person, when they
know that
that is untrue.

46:58.249 --> 47:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, after the
incredible that
carnage that we saw this week,
to honor the

47:03.487 --> 47:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
memories of the people who died
by saying
enough, enough. We're going to
come together

47:09.026 --> 47:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we're going to end this hate
speech against
LGBT people. We are going to
stop lying about

47:16.267 --> 47:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who LGBT people are, in the way
that, after
Charleston, which is a sad
anniversary we

47:21.305 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are approaching, that the
country came together
and said, we're going to examine
how we talk

47:27.878 --> 47:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about race and what symbols we
use, because
attacking people because someone
is uncomfortable

47:35.753 --> 47:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with who other people are and
the ways that
they are different from them,
that's not American.

47:41.158 --> 47:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you both
this question,
finally, which is, how much more
power does

47:47.565 --> 47:53.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this particular attack have on
the imagination,
to the degree that it has been
tied up with

47:53.804 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism, as opposed to -- in
addition to
hate crimes, Mark Potok?

47:58.909 --> 48:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK POTOK: Well, I think it has
a great power
on the imagination.

48:04.448 --> 48:11.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the carnage was just
incredible, and
the mixture of motives. I mean,
it seems to

48:11.555 --> 48:17.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me it's very unclear what this
man's motives
were. They seem to have really
been all three

48:17.561 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strands, a kind of terrorist
strand, to the
extent he seems to be at least
somewhat related

48:22.333 --> 48:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Islamist ideas, a hate crime
strand, in
that it was clearly a huge
animus directed

48:29.473 --> 48:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against LGBT people, and then a
mental health,
or just kind of internal rage
strand, in which

48:35.279 --> 48:38.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this man seemed to be angry at
absolutely
everyone around him.

48:38.516 --> 48:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, briefly, Rachel
Tiven?

48:40.017 --> 48:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL TIVEN: Well, we shouldn't
be surprised,
unfortunately. Right?

48:43.387 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We shouldn't be surprised that
the kind of
animosity that has been
sanctioned by state

48:48.459 --> 48:54.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and local governments around the
country,
when mixed with easy access to
heavy weapons,

48:54.465 --> 48:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leads to a tragedy like this
one.

48:56.400 --> 49:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rachel Tiven of
Lambda Legal and
Mark Potok of the Southern
Poverty Law Center,

49:02.273 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you both very much.

49:03.274 --> 49:06.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL TIVEN: Thank you.

49:06.277 --> 49:13.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK POTOK: Thank you.

49:13.551 --> 49:20.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We close now with
a look at
the vigils and memorials that
have taken place

49:21.091 --> 49:42.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the country to show
solidarity with
the victims in Orlando.

49:42.279 --> 49:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and one unit of faith, and one
prayer, and
join in our hearts together with
the victims,

49:52.656 --> 50:03.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the families, the friends,
the loved
ones. It breaks out hearts, and
that is why

50:03.667 --> 50:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have all gathered here.

50:05.636 --> 50:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Every couple of months,
it feels like
some other group is targeted, a
black church,

50:36.734 --> 50:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a school, a gay club. And the
world we live
in is filled with intimate and
tragic moments

50:38.202 --> 50:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pain and hatred and violence.
We don't
always know how to respond.

50:42.206 --> 50:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Fifty people who I didn't
know, but
were part of my community, were
killed. And

50:47.978 --> 50:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were killed for exact
reasons that I
could be killed or my
congregation could be

50:52.783 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed or people I love.

50:56.287 --> 51:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We are one people who
share the bond
of humanity and the shared
values of the sanctity

51:09.066 --> 51:14.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life and the freedom to live
as we see
fit. We reject your hatred, and
we assert

51:14.805 --> 51:18.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
our love.

51:18.509 --> 51:29.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Our coverage
continues online,
where you can watch President
Obama discuss

51:29.219 --> 51:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stopping terrorists from getting
guns in an
exclusive clip from our recent
town hall,

51:34.391 --> 51:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compare U.S. gun laws to those
of other countries
in an explainer from the Council
on Foreign

51:39.797 --> 51:45.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Relations, and read how two
poets mourned
last year's deadly mass shooting
at a Charleston,

51:45.469 --> 51:46.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
South Carolina, church.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

51:52.609 --> 51:57.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, we will look at a
controversial
program to combat violent
extremism born here

51:57.948 --> 51:59.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at home and abroad.

51:59.316 --> 52:00.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:02.252 --> 52:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS

thank you, and good night.
