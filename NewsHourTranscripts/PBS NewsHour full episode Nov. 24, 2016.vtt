00:07.774 --> 00:13.213 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
tonight, I talk with Green party nominee Jill
Stein. Why she s raising millions of dollars

00:13.313 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for an election recount. Then, striving for
peace, the Colombian president and FARC rebels

00:18.752 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sign a revised treaty hoping to end, 52 years
of war. Plus, on Thanksgiving day, the history

Americans took time out today to celebrate
thanksgiving with feasts, parades and football.

01:21.281 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In New York, the annual Macy s thanksgiving
day parade went smoothly, amidst tight security.

01:26.486 --> 01:31.158 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thousands of heavily-armed officers were in
the streets, and police blocked intersections

01:31.258 --> 01:37.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with dump trucks filled with sand. Meanwhile
in Washington, president Obama, in a recorded

Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our

01:42.169 --> 01:47.374 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
differences, we re still one people, part
of something bigger than ourselves. We are

01:47.474 --> 01:53.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
communities that move forward together. We
are neighbors who look out for one another,

01:53.113 --> 01:58.485 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
especially those among us with the least.
We are always, simply, Americans.

The Islamic state also carried out a massive
suicide bombing south of Baghdad today, killing

02:16.737 --> 02:23.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at least 56 people, though some reports put
the toll as high as 100. 20 of the dead were

02:23.176 --> 02:29.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Iranian Shiite pilgrims. Another 45 people
were injured. I m joined now via skype by

02:29.316 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
special correspondent Jane Ferguson, who s
reporting for us from northern Iraq. Jane,

02:34.254 --> 02:36.023 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
what can you tell us about what happened today?

02:36.123 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON, PBS CORRESPONDENT: John, among
those killed in today s bombing were many

02:39.960 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Iranian Shiite pilgrims on their way back
to Baghdad for a religious occasion in the

holy city of Karbala about 70 miles south
of the capital.

02:50.003 --> 02:55.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The suicide bomber detonated a huge truck
bomb at a busy gas and restaurant where several

02:55.842 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
buses of pilgrims were. I. S. I. S. has claimed
responsibility for the attack. The group regularly

03:02.783 --> 03:08.121 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
target Shiites who they view as not true Muslims.
Meanwhile, it s Shiites militias who have

have taken control of a crucial road in and

03:21.101 --> 03:26.873 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
out of Mosul which effectively cuts off ISIS
militants in Mosul city stopping them from

03:26.973 --> 03:29.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
resupplying or retreating.

03:29.242 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Militias have made an unprecedented deal
with Iraqi Kurdish fighters called Peshmerga

03:34.714 --> 03:40.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to cooperate in cutting off Mosul. In the
east of the city, Iraqi troops have been battling

03:40.420 --> 03:46.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ISIS since the launch of an offensive to retake
the city over six weeks ago. They have been

03:46.326 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
engaged in street to street fighting as the
militants have dug in to the heavily populated

03:51.798 --> 03:53.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

03:53.733 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s a tough fight and progress is slow. They
expect it will be another two or three months

03:58.605 --> 04:03.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
before they can take the city. Over 5,000
US Troops are in Iraq, advising and supporting

At least 67 workers died in southeast china

04:20.193 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
today when scaffolding collapsed at a power
plant construction site. It happened in the

04:24.998 --> 04:30.137 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
city of Fengcheng, and is one of the country s
deadliest work safety accidents in more than

04:30.237 --> 04:36.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
two years. Cement slabs and metal beams crushed
all but three of the 70 workers when a support

04:36.810 --> 04:38.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
platform gave way.

04:38.745 --> 04:43.884 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An investigation into what caused the collapse
is underway. In Syria, rebels in the besieged

04:43.984 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
city of Aleppo have agreed to a UN plan to
allow aid deliveries and evacuate the wounded.

04:49.723 --> 04:55.195 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But UN officials said they re still waiting
for approval from the Syrian government. The

04:55.295 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

05:49.783 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
when his bus ran into a tree.

05:51.651 --> 05:57.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He faces six counts of vehicular homicide.
Five children remain hospitalized. The bus

05:57.891 --> 06:06.600 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

two years alone. Hurricane Otto gained speed

06:06.700 --> 06:12.939 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

including many who crowded onto buses bound

06:24.584 --> 06:30.624 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for shelters. Otto is expected to weaken to
a tropical storm later today. Still to come

06:30.724 --> 06:36.830 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on the Newshour, we talk to Jill Stein about
her plans to ask for an election recount.

nominee is preparing to request recounts in

06:58.318 --> 07:04.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
key battleground states. In just a day, she s
raised over $4 million dollars through an

trump in the popular vote by more than 2 million

07:16.136 --> 07:21.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
votes, she trails Mr. Trump by narrow margins
in those three states. To discuss the push

07:21.741 --> 07:26.713 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for recounts, green party presidential nominee
doctor Jill Stein joins me now from Camden,

07:26.813 --> 07:29.215 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Maine. Dr. Stein, welcome.

07:29.316 --> 07:34.688 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Let me ask you, will you be filing these requests?
I know the deadline is tomorrow in Wisconsin,

07:34.788 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and then next week in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Will you be filing in all three states?

07:39.492 --> 07:43.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JILL STEIN, GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:
Yes, we will. The big question was whether

07:43.263 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the American people supported this enough
that they would fund it. All we did was put

07:50.303 --> 07:53.073 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
out the press release, put up a web site

07:53.173 --> 07:54.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 10: 00. 2]

07:55.075 --> 07:59.279 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the funding for it in. The American people
are looking for a positive step that we can

07:59.379 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
take to ensure that our votes are being counted
and that they re counted accurately.

08:05.985 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: And what s your goal with this? Do you
think you can overturn the election with these

08:11.057 --> 08:12.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recounts?

08:12.926 --> 08:16.596 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEIN: I don t think that s likely and this
is not done to benefit one candidate at the

08:16.696 --> 08:22.569 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
expense of the other. This is being done because
American s came out of this election, not

08:22.669 --> 08:29.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
happy campers. 80 percent of Americans according
to the New York Times poll, felt disgusted

08:29.542 --> 08:31.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

08:31.344 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These were two candidates that, you know,
largely people were voting out of fear and

08:35.248 --> 08:41.988 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the question was which one do you trust less
-- you know, the most disliked and untrusted

08:42.088 --> 08:46.526 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
candidates in our history. I think Americans
are looking for a way that we can improve

08:46.626 --> 08:48.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s not just an academic question, but it s
the question of the job, the healthcare we

08:51.631 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can t afford and a generation locked in debt,
non-academic is very up close and personal

08:56.936 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and what I have been shocked by is in this
holiday weekend when usually people retreat

09:02.475 --> 09:08.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to the pleasures of their families and the
wonderful food and all that, you know, we

09:08.481 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
don t see that happening at all. People are
really wanting to jump forward toward creating

09:13.353 --> 09:19.192 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a political system that we feel like we can
have confidence in.

09:19.292 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: As you explain, we are talking to you
by Skype and we re hearing other news organizations

09:23.563 --> 09:28.501 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trying to reach you. Do you have any in evidence
those three states of any irregularities,

09:28.601 --> 09:36.643 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hacking, any problems in those states other
than the narrow margins? Why pick those three

09:36.743 --> 09:38.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states?

09:38.578 --> 09:42.549 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEIN: Because the margins were narrow and
if they were hacking, those were the states

09:42.649 --> 09:47.220 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you would expect to see where the difference
is very close and the impact would have been

09:47.320 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a small, statistical change that would have
changed the outcome and just left it with

09:52.759 --> 09:58.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a very minor difference in the votes between
the two candidates.

09:58.331 --> 10:04.771 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is not a smoking gun here, but what
the election integrity experts tell us and

10:04.871 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the advocates for verified voting, what they
tell us, is that -- well in fact, it s not

10:11.911 --> 10:16.516 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
just them, you know, this is sort of the obvious,
the elephant s in the room. This was an election

10:16.616 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in which we saw hacking all over the place,
we saw hacking into the democratic party database

10:21.187 --> 10:26.993 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and hacking into voter database in Illinois
and Arizona and evidence that it was attempted

10:27.093 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
much more broadly and we also saw hacking
into personal accounts.

10:31.498 --> 10:35.869 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, we have a voting system
which has been proven to basically be wide

10:35.969 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
open to hackers. That is, we have voting machines
in Wisconsin, for example, that have been

10:41.674 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
barred from California, that got actually
made illegal in California because they have

10:47.113 --> 10:53.653 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
been proven to be drop-dead simple to go in
and reprogram with malicious software.

10:53.753 --> 11:00.860 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So we re sake you wouldn t get into an airplane
and wait for it to crash to decide you need

11:00.960 --> 11:07.667 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
quality assurance and a backup system. Our
voting system is no less important and we re

11:07.767 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
basically calling for a system to verify voting.
We shouldn t have to show there s been a disaster

11:13.339 --> 11:16.843 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in order to safeguard a very vulnerable voting
system.

11:16.943 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Green party nominee Jill Stein. Thankyou so much for joining us.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEIN: Thank you so much.

11:23.082 --> 11:28.021 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: To dig deeper into the recount push,
I m joined by David Sanger, national security

11:28.121 --> 11:31.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
correspondent for the New York Times, he has
been following this story. David, welcome,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.760 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
thanks for coming in on Thanksgiving day.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.728 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID SANGER, SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR NEW
YORK TIMES: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving

11:35.828 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to you. We re all given thanks for Gwen s
life.

11:38.298 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Absolutely, thank you. Where does this
talk come from? The sudden talk about recounts

11:46.573 --> 11:48.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in those three states come from?

11:48.441 --> 11:54.480 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: John, I think it comes from the fact
as Dr. Stein indicated the popular vote has

11:54.581 --> 12:02.355 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
now risen, it s over 2 million lead for secretary
Clinton, and the margin in the three critical

12:02.455 --> 12:08.695 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
has narrowed and that has prompted people

12:08.795 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who have been looking at the hacking questions
and others to say if we were getting down

12:13.499 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to such small amounts, do we need to go check
because of possibly miscounting but also because

12:19.872 --> 12:21.674 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to have the risk of hacking.

12:21.774 --> 12:28.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, when you look at Pennsylvania where the
margin is still about 70,000 or so, the chances

12:28.715 --> 12:33.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that this would change the result are pretty
miniscule but there may be other good reasons

12:33.953 --> 12:35.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for doing it anyway.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 15: 00. 1]

12:37.624 --> 12:41.294 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: A group of computer scientists called
the Clinton campaign last week to urge them

12:41.394 --> 12:47.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to do this. Do they have any evidence or any
proof that something happened in these three

12:47.533 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states?

12:49.402 --> 12:53.039 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: They don t seem to. I think the telling
issue here is the Clinton campaign has not

12:53.139 --> 12:57.777 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
asked for a recount and I think that tells
you that they don t believe this would alter

12:57.877 --> 12:59.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the result.

12:59.712 --> 13:06.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What they do have is looking at the variance
between where a number of the pre-election

13:06.519 --> 13:11.591 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
polls were in, of course, as we all know,
those were notoriously bad in these cases

13:11.691 --> 13:18.331 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and where the vote count has come out, and
then some of the usual variances that you

13:18.431 --> 13:23.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
see just precinct by precinct, and there are
always some number of precincts where it looks

13:24.070 --> 13:28.875 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like there were several more thousand voters
who came in or several thousand fewer and

13:28.975 --> 13:30.743 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
it doesn t match up with the numbers.

13:30.843 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It usually comes out in the wash of doing
the verification of the vote. But in Wisconsin

13:37.617 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and Michigan, there are paper backups and
that s the critical thing, digitized as we

13:43.122 --> 13:49.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
get, John. Voting is one thing where you sort
of want to take a big step back and always

13:49.962 --> 13:55.435 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have a paper backup. In Pennsylvania, that s
true only in a few parts of the state.

13:55.535 --> 14:00.173 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Dr. Stein says she doesn t think this
would change the outcome and you have suggested

14:00.273 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it s unlikely. So what s the point of going
through this?

14:04.310 --> 14:12.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: One point is every state has a different
system and different levels of cyber security.

14:12.418 --> 14:18.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And if there was one big lesson from the 2016
election, apart from the issues between the

14:19.025 --> 14:24.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
candidates, is that we are vulnerable to a
foreign power to come in and attempting to

14:24.197 --> 14:27.900 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
influence the election and that s of course
what the intelligence agencies were saying

14:28.000 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
about the hacks of the DNC and John Podesta,
the chairman of the Clinton campaign s e-mails.

14:36.275 --> 14:44.217 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If that s the case, we have to all up our
game for sanctity of the election system.

14:44.317 --> 14:49.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think if states understand, that they are
going to be required to go back and look at

14:49.822 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the paper ballots either on a sample or full
basis, they will probably invest more in their

14:57.497 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cyber security if they believe that there
is a chance that there could be hacking, they

15:03.536 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need a better system.

15:05.338 --> 15:10.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In this particular case, when the issue is
this narrow, if they don t go back and do

15:11.077 --> 15:16.549 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it, there will be conspiracy theories between
now and 30 years from now saying the 2016

15:16.649 --> 15:22.789 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
election, there was something suspect there.
So if they pass up this chance, they will

15:22.889 --> 15:28.594 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
open up to the conspiracy theories having
their case even if their case is unfounded.

15:28.694 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: So, is it do it to prove that nothing
happened that there was no hacking?

15:34.567 --> 15:40.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: I think it s do it to be sure there
was no hacking and do it to make sure states

15:41.040 --> 15:46.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
recognize if they don t have the best cyber
security around which includes understanding

15:46.345 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what sort of malware can come into the systems
and investing in the front end, they probably

15:51.150 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
will have to pay a lot more money at the back
end if elections close.

15:55.588 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, the way the states are doing this
right now, you only do a recount if the two

16:01.260 --> 16:10.136 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people running are within half a percent or
less of each other. For a half of an election,

16:10.236 --> 16:16.042 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
that wouldn t make sense because any sophisticated
hacker is going to know that the state s cutoff

16:16.142 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is half of one percent and make sure the margin
is slightly larger than that to avoid an automatic

16:22.415 --> 16:27.920 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
recount. So you ve got to stay one thought
out ahead of some very sophisticated hackers.

16:28.020 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: David Sanger of the New York Times.
Thanks for joining us.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANGER: Thank you.

16:40.132 --> 16:45.204 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: The president of Colombia signed a new
peace deal with FARC rebels this morning,

16:45.304 --> 16:51.043 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
about six weeks after voters narrowly rejected
an earlier agreement. Days after that vote,

16:51.143 --> 16:55.748 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president Juan Manuel Santos received the
Nobel peace prize for his efforts to end that

16:55.848 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
five-decade OLD war. For more, I m joined
from Bogota by special correspondent Nadja

17:01.287 --> 17:05.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Drost. Nadja, how significant were the changes
that were made after the referendum?

17:05.892 --> 17:09.996 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NADJA DROST, PBS CORRESPONDENT: Well, John,
the government and the FARC said they incorporated

17:10.096 --> 17:17.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
many if not most to have the changes that
no campaigners and opponents of the PCL had

17:17.169 --> 17:18.804 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
voiced. The current PCL. That was just

17:18.905 --> 17:20.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 20: 00. 3]

17:20.740 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
signed has included over 50 changes, among
them the FARC has promised that they will

17:26.178 --> 17:32.251 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
reveal all information related to narco trafficking
and drug trafficking routes to help out law

17:32.351 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enforcement. But could it say that many of
the changes in this new deal don t go far

17:38.324 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enough in punishing the FARC in serious human
rights abuses.

17:42.261 --> 17:47.667 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For example, one to have the main arguments
is FARC leaders should not be able to run

17:47.767 --> 17:53.339 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
for political office while still serving alternative
sentence force atrocities committed.

17:53.439 --> 17:59.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Why was the government insistent on
getting it renegotiated and signed quickly?

17:59.578 --> 18:05.084 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: There is a real sense of urgency here
to get this peace process back on track because

18:05.184 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
simple referendum and the PCL failed on October
2nd. We have about 7,000 FARC fighters spread

18:12.925 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
out across the country in judicial limbo and
their demobilization has been paralyzed. While

18:19.098 --> 18:24.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
there is a bilateral seize fire in place,
it s fragility was demonstrated. Earlier this

18:24.770 --> 18:35.348 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
month two FARC guerillas were killed. This
weekend at least three random activists and

18:35.448 --> 18:40.820 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
leaders in a social movement assassinated
and another one killed this morning.

18:40.920 --> 18:47.727 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: What are the next steps? What are the
challenges in implementing this peace deal?

18:47.827 --> 18:53.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: President Santos decided not to put
this new peace deal to a popular vote as he

18:53.366 --> 18:59.872 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
did last time and it failed. Instead, he is
sending it immediately to congress for approval.

18:59.972 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
While we don t yet know if the implementation
of the deal will get fast tracked into congress

19:06.412 --> 19:09.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or dragged out in debates.

19:09.815 --> 19:16.555 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We know the opponents to this deal in congress
lead by former president Alavaro Uribe have

19:16.655 --> 19:22.361 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
vowed to oppose the deal, but how much they ll
actually will be able to do in congress considering

19:22.461 --> 19:29.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they re a minority is it s not looking very
hopeful for them to actually help any legislative

19:29.402 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changes.

19:31.237 --> 19:34.573 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Nadja, this has been a bit of a roller
coaster ride, the peace agreement reached,

19:34.673 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rejected by the referendum, renegotiated and
signed. What s the mood of the public now?

19:40.046 --> 19:48.454 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: We re here in Bogota s main square,
the Plaza Bolivar. There is definitely a sense

19:48.554 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of, I would say, mild jubilation, but more
of that relief. However, I would say that

19:55.094 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the patience of Colombians has been really
tested out with this peace process and it

20:01.200 --> 20:06.439 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hasn t been beneficial for anybody that this
peace deal has been going through so many

20:06.539 --> 20:08.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stages of limbo.

20:08.174 --> 20:16.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

10 restaurants that changed America. Black

brings people together. But first, the tragic
toll of substance abuses in America. A new

the heroin and opioid epidemic that s plaguing

20:48.981 --> 20:51.283 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the country. William Brangham has more:

20:51.383 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS CORRESPONDENT: According
to the surgeon general s report more than

21:01.060 --> 21:05.664 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a fraction of those people, only 10 percent,
get meaningful help. The report cites missed

opportunities for prevention and treatment
and it says our substance abuse costs the

21:10.769 --> 21:17.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
country a staggering 440 billion a year. I m
joined by the US surgeon general Dr. Vivek

21:17.543 --> 21:19.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Murthy. Dr. , thank you very much for being
here.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
VIVEK MURTHY, US SURGEON GENERAL: Really glad
to be with you.

21:21.380 --> 21:26.819 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: This is a pretty sobering report.
Millions of people suffering, very, very few

21:26.919 --> 21:31.290 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people are getting help. When you compiled
all this data, were you surprised by what

21:31.390 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you had found?

21:33.292 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Well, I had seen the problem up close
as a doctor practicing medicine. When I came

21:40.132 --> 21:45.571 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
into medicine, I expected as an internal medicine
doctor to primarily see people with diabetes,

21:45.671 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
heart disease and cancer, and I was shocked
by the number of patients who came under my

21:51.844 --> 21:53.546 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
care who actually had substance abuse.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.582 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: You were seeing this in private
practice before being tapped to be in the

21:56.682 --> 21:58.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal government?

21:58.484 --> 22:01.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Yes, I have always seen this -- we
even -- starting in medical school itself

22:01.420 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and then on throughout

22:02.421 --> 22:04.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 25: 00. 1]

22:04.290 --> 22:07.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
my medical career, the experience was not
unique to me but many of my clinician colleagues

22:07.326 --> 22:09.962 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
were seeing the same thing and they were really
surprised.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When I became surgeon general and had the
privilege of travelling around the country

22:13.432 --> 22:18.337 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and hearing people s stories firsthand, I
found that every community was touched in

22:18.437 --> 22:24.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
some way by substance abuse disorders. I went
to a small fishing village in Alaska called

22:24.710 --> 22:29.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Napaskiak which is accessible only by boat
and no roads to go there and even in this

22:29.982 --> 22:35.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
small village of less than 500 people, the
small little building where they kept medications

22:35.621 --> 22:40.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
had been broken into multiple times by people
seeking out prescription painkillers.

22:40.492 --> 22:44.997 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: You say in this report that we as
a nation need to think differently about addiction

22:45.097 --> 22:49.468 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and to look at substance abuse and addiction
differently. How do we look at it now and

22:49.568 --> 22:51.303 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
what would you like to see change?

22:51.403 --> 22:56.041 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Unfortunately, for too many people,
addiction is a disease of choice, they see

22:56.141 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
as a character flaw as evidence of moral failing,
but what we know they are clearly from the

23:01.280 --> 23:05.217 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
science, is that addiction is actually none
of those things it s a chronic disease of

23:05.317 --> 23:07.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the brain.

23:07.119 --> 23:11.557 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have good scientific studies that tell
us that addiction impacts the circuits in

23:11.657 --> 23:16.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
your brain and in specific parts of the brain
that affect impulse control, decision making

23:16.762 --> 23:21.367 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and your stress and reward response. When
we understand that, we start to have a better

23:21.467 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sense of why it is so easy for people to relapse
with substance abuse disorders and why people

23:26.505 --> 23:28.507 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
experience withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

23:28.607 --> 23:34.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Can you explain -- that number really
jumps, 440 billion dollars in costs from substance

23:34.613 --> 23:37.416 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse. How do the costs add up?

23:37.516 --> 23:42.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: These costs come from several streams.
One is from direct healthcare costs. Also

23:42.321 --> 23:48.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
losses in workplace productivity as well as
criminal justice system costs. The good news

23:48.861 --> 23:53.732 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is we have evidence-based treatment and prevention
strategies at work. The problem is they re

23:53.832 --> 23:55.534 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
just not getting it to enough people.

23:55.634 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Why is that? You report details
quite a bit of these things that you argue

24:00.572 --> 24:04.143 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
absolutely are proven to work but aren t being
used, why is that?

24:04.243 --> 24:07.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: It s really striking and it s especially
striking when you recognize it. Not only do

24:07.780 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we have a humanitarian reason to get treatments
to people but we know that for every dollar

24:11.617 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that we invest in treatment we save four dollars
in healthcare costs, seven dollars in criminal

24:15.120 --> 24:20.926 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
justice system costs. We have prevention programs
that are proven, that can save up to 64 dollars

24:21.026 --> 24:22.861 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
for every one dollar invested.

24:22.961 --> 24:26.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A part of the reason that people haven t gotten
these treatments is that, as a country, number

24:26.432 --> 24:31.070 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
one, we haven t invested enough in expansion
of treatment programs. Number two, we haven t

24:31.170 --> 24:35.808 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trained our clinicians widely enough in how
to recognize, diagnose and treat substance

24:35.908 --> 24:41.580 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse disorders and, third, there is this
ongoing, unfortunate stigma around substance

24:41.680 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse disorders that prevents people fromseeking help in the first place.

24:45.751 --> 24:50.856 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: On the prevention side, what is
it that works? What is it that we know can

24:50.956 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
be done to help people to stop these substanceabuse problems from developing?

24:54.860 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Well, the good news is that, there
are prevention programs that don t just target

24:59.264 --> 25:04.236 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
one particular kind of substance but they
can be effective reducing rates of use of

25:04.336 --> 25:09.475 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
alcohol, tobacco as well as elicit substances
particularly by our youth and these programs

25:09.575 --> 25:15.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are varied but some of them are school-based
programs, one called the behavior game which

25:15.481 --> 25:21.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trains young children in how to deal with
stress in a healthy way and how to understand

25:21.353 --> 25:26.125 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
some of these substances of misuse and understand
how to deal with them responsibly.

25:26.225 --> 25:31.497 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are also community-based programs that
focus on education and on dealing with stress

25:31.597 --> 25:36.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in a healthy way. And this is a key point
which is, as I ve traveled around the country,

25:36.101 --> 25:41.173 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have found many times when people are using
substances or when they begin, they begin

25:41.273 --> 25:45.477 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trying to medicate some type of pain they re
experiencing. It may not be physical pain.

25:45.577 --> 25:51.116 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It may be emotional pain or stress they re
experiencing. If we can help equip young people

25:51.216 --> 25:55.354 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in particular with healthy ways of dealing
with stress we can go a long way toward preventing

25:55.454 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
substance abuse disorders.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.493 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: There are many people in the treatment
and the substance abuse world who are so cheered

26:01.593 --> 26:06.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by this report and it s called to action.
There are others say it is too little, too

26:06.632 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
late. I know Massachusetts senator Ed Markey
wrote that overdoses from the opioid epidemic

26:13.372 --> 26:19.845 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are still rising and he says, yet this report
fails to provide any detailed road map for

26:19.945 --> 26:23.348 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
how best to curb opioid addiction. What s
your response to that?

26:23.449 --> 26:28.921 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: A couple of things. Number one, in
this report we took a broad view of all substances.

26:29.021 --> 26:33.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We didn t just look at opioids but we also
looked at alcohol, and it may surprise many

26:33.392 --> 26:39.398 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people to recognize that alcohol leads to
the other substances in terms of cost and

26:39.498 --> 26:41.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lives lost.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So we dealt with a range of substances. If
you read the report carefully where you understand

26:45.471 --> 26:46.872 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
there is in fact a road map

26:46.972 --> 26:48.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 30: 00. 2]

26:48.774 --> 26:51.176 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for how we should approach prevention and
how we should approach treatment, there is

26:51.276 --> 26:56.315 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
also attention to given to recovery because
what we have realized over time is that treatment

26:56.415 --> 27:01.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is not a two-week process where you go in,
get cured and are good to go. Instead, we

27:01.720 --> 27:05.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have to focus on long-term treatment because
this is a chronic illness. We give a fair

27:05.324 --> 27:10.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
amount of attention to recovery services which
are the social supports and ongoing counseling

27:10.229 --> 27:12.598 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that people need in order to reduce the amount
of relapses.

27:12.698 --> 27:19.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My feeling is we have a number of concrete
steps in the report that communities can take

27:19.471 --> 27:25.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and we, in fact, dedicate the entire last
chapter of the report to action, to not just

27:25.611 --> 27:30.282 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
defining the action doctors and nurses can
take but what policymakers and families and

27:30.382 --> 27:35.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
law enforcement and teachers and educators
need to take.

27:35.954 --> 27:40.058 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This report has something for everyone. And
that s appropriate. Substance abuse disorders

27:40.158 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
touch everyone. That s something I ve seen
firsthand and we all need to play a part in

27:44.463 --> 27:46.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
addressing addiction in America.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.601 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Alright. Dr. Vivek Murthy, surgeon
general of the United States. Thank you very

27:49.701 --> 27:50.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

27:51.003 --> 27:58.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MURTHY: Glad to be with you.

27:58.610 --> 28:07.152 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: now, on this thanksgiving day, we devote
the rest of our broadcast to food, and a little

28:07.252 --> 28:11.890 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine. First, economics correspondent Paul
Solman explores the histories of some of this

28:11.990 --> 28:17.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
country s most iconic restaurants, and how
they reflected the cultural, social and economic

28:17.262 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
development of their times.

28:18.263 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

28:20.232 --> 28:23.502 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:
In the heart of Harlem, Sylvia s, where for

28:23.602 --> 28:29.908 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
50-plus years, presidents and pop stars, tourists
and locals have feasted on down home cooking.

28:30.008 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TREN NESS WOODS-BLACK, SYLVIA S: What we serve
here at Sylvia s is authentic, soul-food cuisine,

28:35.480 --> 28:39.017 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rich in heritage that goes back over five
generations.

28:39.117 --> 28:43.355 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Tren ness Woods-Black is a granddaughter
of the late Sylvia Woods from South Carolina.

28:43.455 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WOODS-BLACK: So, you re going to get the original
farm to table, which is what soul food is.

28:48.093 --> 28:52.264 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL FREEDMAN, YALE UNIVERSITY: You can t
write a book about American food without giving

28:52.364 --> 28:58.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a big place to African American cuisine, which
is arguably what American cuisine is at heart.

28:58.470 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Medieval historian Paul freedman,
who turned an academic fascination with Middle

29:03.208 --> 29:10.749 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ages cuisine into a new career in his middle
ages, chronicling American food. His new book,

29:10.849 --> 29:15.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
"Ten Restaurants That Changed America," begins
at Delmonico s in New York s financial district,

29:15.420 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the new nation s first real restaurant.

29:18.690 --> 29:25.864 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: By real, I mean a place that offered
a choice. A large menu, and a fairly wide

29:25.964 --> 29:31.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
range of times when the place was open instead
of saying we serve at 1:00, take it or leave

29:31.770 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: What fascinated me, as a money buff,
was how our restaurants track our economic

29:37.509 --> 29:39.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

29:39.511 --> 29:45.917 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, when Delmonico s opens in the 1830s, that s
the beginning of what we now know as the American

29:46.018 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy?

29:47.819 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: It coincides with an America of
railroads, of rapid expansion to the West,

29:52.758 --> 29:59.364 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of industrialization and of increasing contact
with the rest of the world. It s not a place

29:59.464 --> 30:05.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for people who fancy themselves as squires
or aristocrats. It s a place for enterprising

30:05.904 --> 30:06.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.073 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SOLMAN: But they are wealthy.

FREEDMAN: Definitely.

30:10.042 --> 30:15.213 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: The new money wanted food that was
fancy French, with new world twists. Delmonico s

30:15.313 --> 30:16.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
steak, a rib-eye --

30:16.848 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: They invented Lobster Newburg. They
invented Baked Alaska.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.421 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: They even invented brunch.

30:22.521 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TV HOST: Delmonico s is credited with creatingthis brunch dish -- Erin.

30:26.625 --> 30:27.559 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
CONTESTANT: What is Eggs Benedict?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TV HOST: Good.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.563 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: This was the place to meet and eat,well into the 20th century.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We re going to Delmonico sfor supper, won t you join us?

30:34.433 --> 30:37.803 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will it be tonight,Delmonico s or the Plaza?

30:37.903 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lunch at Delmonico s!

30:39.705 --> 30:44.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: And men and women would show up
together at night, but at lunch, it would

30:44.309 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be men only.

30:46.111 --> 30:50.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Gender exclusivity, which, at the
turn of the 20th century, invited a second

30:50.882 --> 30:56.288 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of freedman s top ten to enter the fray and
helped change America s expanding economy:

30:56.388 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Schrafft s.

30:58.190 --> 31:02.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I remember going to Schrafft s in the 50s
for the sundaes, I believe. The ice cream

31:03.028 --> 31:04.963 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sundaes. That was a real treat.

31:05.063 --> 31:10.502 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: I too remember going there with
my grandmother. It s one of the first restaurants

31:10.602 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to cater to women, not just by providing a
safe atmosphere, but by providing the kind

31:17.209 --> 31:23.048 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of food that women were thought to like to
eat -- light food followed by very rich desserts.

31:23.148 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: But now when Schrafft s starts in
1900, what does that say about what s happening

31:27.552 --> 31:29.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the American economy?

31:29.387 --> 31:35.060 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: We see the rise of a middle middle
class of the sort that we know. They want

31:35.160 --> 31:41.366 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a nice experience. They want food that is
relatively simple or not particularly French.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.401 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: A democratized middle class.

31:43.502 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Yes, exactly. And so the restaurant
options are often for couples, you have to

31:51.143 --> 31:55.814 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
wait for Howard Johnson s and roadside restaurants
for children really to be featured.

31:55.914 --> 32:02.420 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Number three: Howard Johnson s, now
nearly extinct, with just one upstate New

32:02.521 --> 32:07.926 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
York outpost for fried clams and Frankforts,
down from a thousand such orange-and-blue

32:08.026 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
emporia in its mid-20th-century heyday.

32:10.729 --> 32:16.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: In the 1920s, the American dream
was not to own a house, the American dream

32:16.168 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was to own a car and to drive with your family
around to look at the countryside.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Sunday drives.

32:23.608 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Sunday drives. Howard Deering Johnson
developed a restaurant concept that offered

32:28.980 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
food particularly by the side of the new highways
that were opening up for leisure driving.

32:36.521 --> 32:43.028 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: So the advent and success of Howard
Johnson s represents a further democratization

32:43.128 --> 32:44.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the American economy?

32:44.963 --> 32:50.735 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Yes, and it may be an early symbol
of the hollowing out of the middle level.

32:50.836 --> 32:54.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: With HoJo s decline tracking growing
inequality.

32:54.706 --> 33:00.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Because on the one hand you would
have very democratic places like McDonald s.

33:00.779 --> 33:04.115 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And on the other hand you have more and more
fancy restaurants.

33:04.216 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Hoity-toity boites like change agent
number four, Le Pavillon, where chef and owner

33:09.921 --> 33:14.593 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Henri Soule sat A-listers up front, to see
and be seen.

33:14.693 --> 33:19.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: So lots of other places like La
Caravelle, La Grenouille, all of them begin

33:19.331 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
with Le and La, imitated this pattern.

33:22.100 --> 33:27.439 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Or number five, The Four Seasons,
birthplace of seasonal menus and the modern

33:27.539 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
power lunch in an increasingly financialized
economy.

33:31.309 --> 33:35.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: When it started to have these power
lunches it was more media people. Advertising,

33:36.081 --> 33:37.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TV, book publishing.

33:37.315 --> 33:40.919 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: That s the 60s and 70s.

33:41.019 --> 33:47.425 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: 60s and 70s. I asked one of the
owners if that was still true, if there were

33:47.525 --> 33:52.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
still literary agents and authors, and he
looked at me pityingly. He looked at me as

33:52.197 --> 33:56.401 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
if I had asked to send a telegram or where
the nearest automat was.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.703 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
SOLMAN: Because it had become high end finance.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: It s finance and real estate. Serious
money.

34:01.940 --> 34:06.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: There s one big apple restaurant togo: number six, Mamma Leone s.

34:06.578 --> 34:10.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: People say, well how can you have
Italian food in the United States represented

34:10.882 --> 34:17.322 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by a place that was so mass market, so touristy.
That s part of the story of food in the United

34:17.422 --> 34:22.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
States. Mamma Leone s was a pioneer of the
spectacle restaurant. And it introduced a

34:22.861 --> 34:24.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lot of people to Italian food.

34:24.362 --> 34:28.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Marking the true globalization of
the American economy.

34:28.967 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that was also manifest on the West Coast.
Thus, number seven, The Mandarin in San Francisco,

34:35.006 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
where in 1961 chef-owner Cecilia Chang introduced
people to Chinese food north and west of Cantonese.

34:42.881 --> 34:48.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Not just one province of southern
China, as had been the case with Chinese food

34:48.420 --> 34:50.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to that time.

34:50.355 --> 34:54.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: OK, we ve reached 1971 and Freedman s
restaurant number eight. America was now rich

34:54.859 --> 35:00.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enough to start caring about something new
in its food -- how fresh it was; how safe.

35:00.532 --> 35:07.105 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thus Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California,
where chef-owner Alice Waters was the change

35:07.205 --> 35:09.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agent...

35:09.107 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Changing the way many, many people
eat. It s influenced what public schools serve.

35:13.411 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s influenced what Walmart and Target have
available in their produce sections. It s

35:19.751 --> 35:24.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
influenced restaurants pretty far down the
price food chain.

35:24.622 --> 35:30.895 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Number nine? Antoine s of New Orleans,
owned and run by the same family since 1840.

35:30.996 --> 35:35.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An example of regional American cuisine: in
this case. Creole.

CARTOON CHARACTER: You can t beat a good old
Back-bay Bayou Bunny Bordelais, a la Antoine.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.075 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: America as melting pot.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
CARTOON CHARACTER: ZE Antoine of New Orleans?

35:46.378 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CARTOON CHARACTER: I don t mean Antoine of
Flatbush!

35:48.880 --> 35:53.284 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Regional food is part of the heritage
of America and it s something that s being

35:53.385 --> 35:55.553 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
brought back, particularly Southern food.

35:55.653 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Which brings us back to number 10,
Sylvia s in Harlem, where the Woods family

36:01.893 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
carries on old traditions, and new ones, like
the timely Thanksgiving take-home package

36:08.633 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for an ever busier America.

36:10.769 --> 36:15.640 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WOODS-BLACK: You ve got turkey, you have dressing,
you have collard greens, macaroni and cheese,

36:15.740 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cornbread, sweet potato pie, you have everything
that you need that in the end, you can take

36:22.580 --> 36:27.519 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a little flour and just like, put it on your
face to make you look like a Thanksgiving

36:27.619 --> 36:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dinner superstar.

36:29.487 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Without all the effort. Time is money,
wrote Ben Franklin in 1748, which is a key

36:36.227 --> 36:41.099 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
reason Americans have been eating out, ever
since.

YANG: And now, a second helping of our food
theme. At a part of the country where ethnic

37:01.453 --> 37:07.192 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cuisine can be found on nearly every street
corner, one entrepreneur is relying on refugees

37:07.292 --> 37:10.095 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to bring their home cooking to New York City
foodies.

William Brangham is back with a visit to a
Long Island kitchen,

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

37:15.467 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT:
It s business as usual inside the kitchen

37:17.268 --> 37:22.340 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Eat Offbeat -- a New York City catering
company. Recipes, prepared with precision

37:22.440 --> 37:28.480 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
slicing and dicing, are cooked to perfection.
But the chefs here all have one thing in common:

37:28.580 --> 37:34.219 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they re refugees, and none of them, until
recently, had any formal culinary training

37:34.319 --> 37:38.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANAL KAHI, FOUNDER EAT OFFBEAT: Today, we
have chefs from Syria, Iraq, Nepal, Eritrea,

37:38.723 --> 37:43.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Conakry. They re all
working each on their own dish and we have

37:44.028 --> 37:45.830 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
a few deliveries happening this afternoon.

37:45.930 --> 37:50.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Manal Kahi created Eat Offbeat with
her brother Wissam last year. The idea came

37:51.002 --> 37:57.242 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to them a few years before, after Kahi kept
trying different brands of American made hummus

37:57.342 --> 37:59.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and nothing measured up to her grandmother s
recipe.

37:59.544 --> 38:05.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: I had recently moved to the U.S. from
Lebanon and I kind of missed my home. In the

38:05.817 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
midst of the refugee crisis back in Lebanon,
our grandmother happens to be from Aleppo,

38:11.156 --> 38:16.294 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from Syria, originally. It was relatively
natural for us to say if you want someone

38:16.394 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as talented as our grandmother to make hummus
for New Yorkers, maybe we should see the refugees

38:21.966 --> 38:25.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
coming from Syria. We probably would findsomeone who s just like her.

38:25.170 --> 38:30.175 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: That idea soon grew beyond just
Syrians -- Kahi believed that talented home

38:30.275 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cooks from across the globe could offer New
Yorkers unique flavors, prepared in traditional

38:35.480 --> 38:37.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

38:37.382 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: Cuisines like Iraqi food, Syrian, Nepali,
Eritrean, it s not really cuisines that you

38:42.820 --> 38:47.025 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can find around every corner even here in
New York, as cosmopolitan as it can be. When

38:47.125 --> 38:51.496 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we say authentic, it s not necessarily the
way it s made in that country or it s been

38:51.596 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
made in that country hundred years ago. It s
the way they make it at home, the way they

38:55.300 --> 38:58.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
eat it with their families. That s the way
we re selling it.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.974 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
BRANGHAM: Eat Offbeat partners with the International
Rescue Committee to find their chefs, and

39:03.074 --> 39:08.313 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
twelve of them are now employed with the company.

39:08.413 --> 39:12.150 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Because it s their first time working in a
professional kitchen, they need a bit of training,

39:12.250 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and so, the culinary process is overseen by
head chef Juan Suarez De Lezo. He s worked

39:17.655 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at some of the top restaurants in both Spain
and the U.S.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUAN SUAREZ DE LEZO, HEAD CHEF: I m teaching
them how to move in a professional kitchen,

39:24.028 --> 39:29.567 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
how to work, how to organize, how to balance
flavors, because at the end, they ve been

39:29.667 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cooking always for their families which is
amazing, but in this case, now they re cooking

39:34.606 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for New Yorkers. So, they need to adapt thoseflavors in somehow for the city.

39:39.410 --> 39:45.083 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: For Rachana Rimal, a Nepalese chef,
she s been preparing a dish that is generally

39:45.183 --> 39:47.352 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
served at special occasions in her country.

39:47.452 --> 39:50.855 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RACHANA RIMAL, CHIEF, EAT OFFBEAT: This isa chicken ball, actually.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Like a meatball?

39:52.790 --> 39:55.927 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RIMAL: Like a meatball but I put a lot of
spices on it, like onions and my ingredients

39:56.027 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
here, culmi, mustard. I put everything here.

39:59.731 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Rimal s daughter Satakshi came to
the U.S. with her a few years ago when they

40:07.372 --> 40:13.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
fled Nepal as a family. She works as the kitchen
manager for Eat Offbeat. With a meticulous

40:13.244 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
eye, she oversees deliveries, portion sizes,
and, for the first time in her life, keeping

40:18.716 --> 40:20.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her own mom in line.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SATAKSHI RIMAL, KITCHEN MANAGER, EAT OFFBEAT:
I get to boss her around here and she gets

40:23.521 --> 40:27.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to boss me around at home. So, I think weeven each other out pretty well.

40:27.992 --> 40:32.263 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Larry Younck is a senior refugee
resettlement officer for the United Nations

40:32.363 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Washington, D.C. Younck says cooking is
often a perfect job for refugees when they

40:37.201 --> 40:38.970 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
first arrive to the United States.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.805 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LARRY YOUNCK, SENIOR REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT
OFFICER, UNITED NATIONS: Refugees are expected

40:40.905 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to be self-supporting very quickly, a few
months after arriving here, and to find jobs

40:44.676 --> 40:49.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the U.S. and that can be a challenge when
you don t speak English or you speak limited

40:49.480 --> 40:55.353 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
English and your job skills maybe are hard
to transfer from your home country. But when

40:55.453 --> 41:01.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it comes to food, food communicates regardless
of whether you can speak English or not.

41:01.392 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Younck also believes more companies
should follow Eat Offbeat s lead when it comes

41:05.763 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hiring refugees.

41:07.765 --> 41:12.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YOUNCK: What we see is refugees in general
in a lot of walks of life are much more entrepreneurial

41:13.037 --> 41:19.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
than typically Americans are because, again,
they ve taken risks. They know what it is

41:19.610 --> 41:22.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to try something and maybe you succeed and
maybe you don t.

41:22.780 --> 41:27.652 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: But Manal Kahi wants her company
to go further, not just to offer jobs, but

41:27.752 --> 41:31.489 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to help change the perception of refugees
as just being vulnerable, needy people.

41:31.589 --> 41:36.828 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: That s exactly what they re trying to
prove wrong. In our opinion, refugees are

41:36.928 --> 41:42.800 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
very skilled. They bring with them a lot of
skills, a lot of talent, a lot of heritage

41:42.900 --> 41:47.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that they can share with their host communities.
And given the right opportunity, the right

41:48.072 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
space, they have a lot to contribute for the
local economy, and for the local communities.

41:52.377 --> 41:57.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: And for employees like Satakshi
Rimal, she says the kitchen has become a place

41:57.882 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
where chefs do much more than simply cook.

42:00.585 --> 42:06.591 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RIMAL: The best I could describe is it s a
second home to everybody. It s like a bunch

42:06.691 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of aunts coming in, cooking at a common kitchen.
And, you know, it s like joint family so you

42:11.629 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have everything that happens in a household.
There s screaming, there s, "hey, don t put

42:15.233 --> 42:19.137 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
too much of this. Don t put so much of it."Even if that s not their dish.

42:19.237 --> 42:23.408 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Eat Offbeat mainly caters to large
groups, but is hoping to expand into a delivery

42:23.508 --> 42:29.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
service in the coming months. And as for the
hummus -- Kahi says her company s recipe would

42:29.380 --> 42:30.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make grandma proud.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mmm, that is great.

42:32.884 --> 42:37.121 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour", I m William Brangham

MARTIN SEEMUNGAL, PBS NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over): South Africa s breathtaking

43:20.331 --> 43:27.138 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
vineyards near Cape Town, perfectly manicured
estates spreading for miles in every direction,

43:27.238 --> 43:34.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
famous for world class wines. But a world
away, from the sprawling townships on the

43:34.812 --> 43:39.917 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
outskirts of the city -- infamous for forced
resettlement of mixed race and black South

43:40.017 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Africans, for crime and poverty -- you have
to look pretty hard to find a common link

43:44.655 --> 43:51.496 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- but it is there, one little square among
a sea of shacks: a man planting a vineyard.

43:51.596 --> 43:59.704 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Manelisi Mapukata is part of an innovative
collective; growing wine grapes in small plots

43:59.804 --> 44:06.043 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that will one day make wine. The township
winery started production using grapes from

44:06.143 --> 44:11.883 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
those traditional winemaking areas, Sauvignon
Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinotage, but the labels

44:11.983 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are unique... The Flats, Philippi, names from
this part of town. Ultimately, more and more

44:19.490 --> 44:22.727 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the grapes will come from these tiny township
plots.

44:22.827 --> 44:26.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANELISI MAPUKATA, VINEYARD FARMER: I feel
proud about it because if just give me enough

44:26.631 --> 44:36.240 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time also I will learn more about grapes.
How it s important to have in our townships.

44:36.340 --> 44:41.379 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People can learn. People can come to visitalso to see what is happening.

44:41.479 --> 44:46.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: The vines he is planting here won t
actually be ready to bear fruit for another

44:47.084 --> 44:52.023 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
three years, but after that, he will have
a guaranteed harvest every year, and that

44:52.123 --> 44:55.760 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
means a guaranteed income.

44:55.860 --> 45:01.399 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
That guaranteed income is an enormously important
project to the farmers. Many have spent years

45:01.499 --> 45:06.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
growing and selling vegetables and have been
at the mercy of fluctuating prices. Those

45:07.071 --> 45:11.642 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
empty rows in a section of this small plot
will soon be growing grapes and ultimately

45:11.742 --> 45:15.179 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
earn annually as much as all vegetables combined.

45:15.279 --> 45:18.115 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Lulama says it will change their lives.

45:18.215 --> 45:25.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LULAMA, VINEYARD FARMER: It means that we
want to generate more income so that we can

45:25.423 --> 45:30.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
put bread on the table for our children and
the generations to come.

45:30.761 --> 45:36.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: They stand to double what they
are making now. The average income here is

45:36.400 --> 45:42.340 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
roughly $1,800 a year. Easy to understand
why people are energized, why word is spreading.

45:42.440 --> 45:49.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Nomhle Zondani is marketing the Township Winery
internationally, and here in South Africa,

45:49.380 --> 45:53.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
she also has to manage expectations amongthese first time growers.

45:53.351 --> 45:57.955 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NOMHLE ZONDANI, MARKETER, THE TOWNSHIP WINERY:
Its not going to be an easy money making scheme.

45:58.055 --> 46:03.227 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You re not going to get rich in like two years.
So, within that five years, you will get exposure.

46:03.327 --> 46:07.732 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will bring people to say this is an idea
that we have we would love to grow it and

46:07.832 --> 46:12.436 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
after five years, we would then we will have
this whatever grape we can harvest from those

46:12.536 --> 46:14.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vines.

46:14.405 --> 46:18.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: Graham Knox is an expert with years
of experience at all levels of winemaking,

46:18.542 --> 46:24.382 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now a key partner in the township winery.
Hard as it is to believe he says the soil

46:24.482 --> 46:27.351 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in these townships is perfect for wine grapes.

46:27.451 --> 46:33.391 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
GRAHAM KNOX, THE TOWNSHIP WINERY: To grow
vines in the townships brings a response of

46:33.491 --> 46:40.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
surprise, incredulousness. And this is an
opportunity to take the land that s in the

46:40.264 --> 46:46.704 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
township that doesn t have that huge price
tag to enable the ladies to benefit from their

46:46.804 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
works to make a living from growing vines
and grapes in a way that is completely impossible

46:53.511 --> 46:55.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Stellenbosch.

46:55.413 --> 46:59.350 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: Stellenbosch -- about an hour away
-- is home to some of South Africa s premier

46:59.450 --> 47:06.090 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine estates. Warwick is one of them, a pioneer
in its own right. Nearly 40 years ago, Warwick s

47:06.190 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Norma Ratcliffe was one of the first womento make wine in South Africa.

47:09.927 --> 47:14.799 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NORMA RATCLIFFE, WARWICK WINE ESTATE: I started
with six barrels of wine, and I went through

47:14.899 --> 47:21.839 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
all the stages that they will go through,
and a part of being a woman winemaker in those

47:21.939 --> 47:27.578 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
days was novelty. Part of their project is
novelty which will take them quite far as

47:27.678 --> 47:32.283 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
well. People come they want to have a look.
Hey, these guys are doing something neat.

47:32.383 --> 47:38.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: The plan is to showcase that novelty
by converting this old cement factory in one

47:38.622 --> 47:44.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the townships to a winery Knox hopes that
in a few years time, it will be ready to process

47:44.662 --> 47:46.897 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the grapes that will be harvested here.

47:46.997 --> 47:49.867 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
KNOX: And start to come in to those big windows.

47:49.967 --> 47:53.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: He says it will be the focal pointof the township winery project.

47:54.071 --> 48:06.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KNOX: People who drink wine absolutely love
to visit wineries. International press and

48:06.350 --> 48:11.122 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine traders are fascinated by the idea that
we want to grow grapes in the township.

48:11.222 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: And there is more to this story
than the novelty of growing grapes in the

48:16.293 --> 48:21.766 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
township and the economic benefits it will
provide. For decades black and mixed race

48:21.866 --> 48:27.638 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
south Africans were the laborers in the wine
estates. With only a few exceptions, ownership

48:27.738 --> 48:30.407 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
has remained in white hands.

48:30.508 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Arlene Van Wyk says her father and grandfather
were wine farm workers. She says the idea

48:35.212 --> 48:40.985 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of being a winegrower was always an impossible
dream. But now, she s preparing the ground

48:41.085 --> 48:42.787 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to plant her own vineyard.

48:42.887 --> 48:45.389 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ARLENE VAN WYK, VINEYARD FARMER: I ve been
waiting all my life. I ve been poor all my

48:45.489 --> 48:49.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
life. So, now, today, even the farm workers
kids can even now become farmers.

48:49.360 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For me, there s a big change in the last 30
years. There s a lot of white people out there

48:55.699 --> 49:02.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that wants to help us as colored people and
black people. The more doors it will open,

49:02.706 --> 49:08.512 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
more of our black people will have opportunity

SEEMUNGAL: Norma Ratcliffe understands the
impact apartheid had and believes this is

49:15.052 --> 49:16.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an important step.

49:16.887 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RATCLIFFE: I think its going to give these
people a lot more than a stake. I think its

49:21.225 --> 49:27.765 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
going to give them a bit of upliftment. It s
going to say I m doing something and I m worth

49:27.865 --> 49:29.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

SEEMUNGAL: Lulama has turned a dusty corner
of Guletu Township into an oasis of hope,

49:34.238 --> 49:39.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and she is deeply proud, even though it is
in the middle of a poor township.

49:39.109 --> 49:45.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LULAMA: I don t think the beauty of the place
matters. What matters is that you do what

49:46.050 --> 49:51.555 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you want to do. You want to succeed. You want
to reach your goals.

49:51.655 --> 49:57.061 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: They understand success will not
come easy. But these new winegrowers -- in

49:57.161 --> 50:03.534 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the most unlikely of places are determined
to get there -- one tiny vineyard at a time.

YANG: Finally tonight, another in our "Brief
But Spectacular" series where we ask. Tonight,

50:23.354 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we hear from Steve Cohen, owner of New York s
Second Avenue Deli, who gives us his take

50:28.492 --> 50:31.195 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on the pastrami, sliced thin with the side
of schmoozing.

50:31.295 --> 50:33.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

50:33.130 --> 50:34.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEVE COHEN, NEW YORK S SECOND AVENUE DELI:
You meet people in the deli, and it s like

50:35.032 --> 50:41.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you re their best friend. I saw it here in
1981, right before Passover. My favorite part

50:41.872 --> 50:49.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the job is meeting people, talking to people.
I have people that came in as customers and

50:49.613 --> 50:52.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now they are friends. I go to their weddings,
their bar mitzvahs, and, unfortunately, I

50:52.316 --> 50:54.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go to their deaths.

50:54.285 --> 51:06.497 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, it s a good business from a social
standpoint. As a business, it s a little difficult

51:06.597 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
kosher deli business. The food cost is quite
large. Nobody has to throw a benefit for us,

51:11.735 --> 51:13.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it is a fact.

51:13.637 --> 51:20.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have vats and vats of beats. It s briskets.
We have roast beefs. We have pastramis. They

51:20.511 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
have to be steamed properly. They kept properly.

51:22.579 --> 51:29.186 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, it s just a little more difficult to run
and to make money at, to tell you the truth.

51:29.286 --> 51:33.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is a lot of exclusive restaurants in
New York that shall remain nameless. You go

51:33.857 --> 51:36.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to those restaurants and say, look what Ihave, look what I can do.

51:36.994 --> 51:41.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They come to a deli and you say, you know
what? Look what we have. Look what we can

51:41.131 --> 51:45.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
do. We re all a group and friends. And theytalk. It s the great equalizer.

51:46.070 --> 51:50.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When you come to New York, one of the reasons
is pastrami or deli. We have the matzo ball

51:50.708 --> 51:53.544 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
soup. We have a fresh stock pot going.

51:53.644 --> 51:59.750 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our pastrami is mouth watering. You just slice
thin. It s the bacaya (ph), which is a gift.

51:59.850 --> 52:05.155 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have something pacha (ph) is a pickled
calves feet and garlic. We have (INAUDIBLE),

52:05.255 --> 52:10.594 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which is a pasta dish, like a k ration butit tastes good. It s nuts.

52:10.694 --> 52:16.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have darma, which is stuffed darma kishka.
When I see eating kishka here, I say, when s

52:16.800 --> 52:21.005 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the last time you ate a kishka? And they ll
say 30, 40 years ago. And they re right.

52:21.105 --> 52:25.509 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
After a meal like this, you really -- you re
quite full, but you really feel satisfied.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.546 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
You feel like had something, and you ve connected
with the past somewhat.

52:29.646 --> 52:34.618 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have children and grandchildren and I really
don t envy them getting up and growing up

52:34.718 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in this day and age. It s very difficult.
It s very hard.

52:37.788 --> 52:45.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now you just feel it s nice to just relax
and snooze and talk to people and get their

52:45.429 --> 52:49.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ideas and their thoughts. Not so much political
but otherwise.

The Militias have made an unprecedented deal
with Iraqi Kurdish fighters called Peshmerga

55:24.254 --> 55:26.056 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to cooperate in cutting off Mosul. In the
east of the city, Iraqi troops have been battling

55:26.156 --> 55:27.958 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ISIS since the launch of an offensive to retake
the city over six weeks ago. They have been

55:28.058 --> 55:28.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
engaged in street to street fighting as the
militants have dug in to the heavily populated

55:28.492 --> 55:30.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

55:30.427 --> 55:32.196 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s a tough fight and progress is slow. They
expect it will be another two or three months

55:32.296 --> 55:34.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
before they can take the city. Over 5,000
US Troops are in Iraq, advising and supporting

At least 67 workers died in southeast china

55:38.569 --> 55:40.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
today when scaffolding collapsed at a power
plant construction site. It happened in the

55:40.470 --> 55:42.306 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
city of Fengcheng, and is one of the country s
deadliest work safety accidents in more than

55:42.406 --> 55:42.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
two years. Cement slabs and metal beams crushed
all but three of the 70 workers when a support

55:43.040 --> 55:44.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
platform gave way.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.743 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An investigation into what caused the collapse
is underway. In Syria, rebels in the besieged

55:46.843 --> 55:48.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
city of Aleppo have agreed to a UN plan to
allow aid deliveries and evacuate the wounded.

55:48.712 --> 55:50.514 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But UN officials said they re still waiting
for approval from the Syrian government. The

55:50.614 --> 55:51.081 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
UN s humanitarian adviser said they re poised
to act once they get the go-ahead. He spoke

55:55.519 --> 55:57.154 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are ready, greatest humanitarian workers will
be able to go with hundreds of truckloads

since July. Much-needed food and medical supplies

56:01.558 --> 56:03.393 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
haven t been able to reach the area since
then. Separately, a US service member died

56:03.493 --> 56:05.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
when an improvised explosive device detonated
in northern Syria. A sixth child has now died

56:05.362 --> 56:07.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from injuries suffered in a school bus crash
in Chattanooga, Tennessee earlier this week.

56:07.164 --> 56:07.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Police say, Johnthony Walker strayed from
his route and was speeding on a curvy road

56:07.998 --> 56:09.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
when his bus ran into a tree.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.535 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He faces six counts of vehicular homicide.
Five children remain hospitalized. The bus

two years alone. Hurricane Otto gained speed

56:13.503 --> 56:15.072 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and intensity today. It slammed into Nicaragua s
Caribbean coast as a category 2 storm. The

56:15.172 --> 56:16.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
unusually strong, late- season hurricane packedwinds up to 110 miles an hour.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.809 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Officials evacuated more than 10,000 people,
including many who crowded onto buses bound

56:18.909 --> 56:20.644 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for shelters. Otto is expected to weaken to
a tropical storm later today. Still to come

56:20.744 --> 56:22.512 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on the Newshour, we talk to Jill Stein about
her plans to ask for an election recount.

Another peace deal to end Colombia s decades

address the addiction crisis, and much more.

56:25.515 --> 56:27.284 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jill Stein, the Green party s presidential
nominee is preparing to request recounts in

56:27.384 --> 56:29.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
key battleground states. In just a day, she s
raised over $4 million dollars through an

56:29.152 --> 56:30.988 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
online fundraising page to support recounts
in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

56:31.088 --> 56:32.856 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Although Hillary Clinton leads president-elect
trump in the popular vote by more than 2 million

56:32.956 --> 56:34.758 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
votes, she trails Mr. Trump by narrow margins
in those three states. To discuss the push

56:34.858 --> 56:35.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for recounts, green party presidential nominee
doctor Jill Stein joins me now from Camden,

56:35.626 --> 56:37.527 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Maine. Dr. Stein, welcome.

56:37.628 --> 56:39.329 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Let me ask you, will you be filing these requests?
I know the deadline is tomorrow in Wisconsin,

56:39.429 --> 56:41.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and then next week in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Will you be filing in all three states?

56:41.298 --> 56:43.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JILL STEIN, GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:
Yes, we will. The big question was whether

56:43.133 --> 56:44.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the American people supported this enough
that they would fund it. All we did was put

56:44.101 --> 56:44.568 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
out the press release, put up a web site

56:44.668 --> 56:46.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 10: 00. 2]

56:46.570 --> 56:48.238 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the funding for it in. The American people
are looking for a positive step that we can

56:48.338 --> 56:50.140 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
take to ensure that our votes are being counted
and that they re counted accurately.

56:50.240 --> 56:50.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: And what s your goal with this? Do you
think you can overturn the election with these

56:50.741 --> 56:52.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recounts?

56:52.609 --> 56:54.378 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEIN: I don t think that s likely and this
is not done to benefit one candidate at the

56:54.478 --> 56:56.246 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
expense of the other. This is being done because
American s came out of this election, not

56:56.346 --> 56:56.813 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
happy campers. 80 percent of Americans according
to the New York Times poll, felt disgusted

56:56.913 --> 56:58.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

56:58.715 --> 57:00.484 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These were two candidates that, you know,
largely people were voting out of fear and

57:00.584 --> 57:02.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the question was which one do you trust less
-- you know, the most disliked and untrusted

57:02.419 --> 57:02.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
candidates in our history. I think Americans
are looking for a way that we can improve

57:02.953 --> 57:04.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

57:04.788 --> 57:06.556 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s not just an academic question, but it s
the question of the job, the healthcare we

57:06.657 --> 57:08.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can t afford and a generation locked in debt,
non-academic is very up close and personal

57:08.492 --> 57:10.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and what I have been shocked by is in this
holiday weekend when usually people retreat

57:10.294 --> 57:12.095 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to the pleasures of their families and the
wonderful food and all that, you know, we

57:12.195 --> 57:13.563 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
don t see that happening at all. People are
really wanting to jump forward toward creating

57:13.664 --> 57:15.565 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a political system that we feel like we can
have confidence in.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.434 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: As you explain, we are talking to you
by Skype and we re hearing other news organizations

57:17.534 --> 57:19.336 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trying to reach you. Do you have any in evidence
those three states of any irregularities,

57:19.436 --> 57:19.770 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hacking, any problems in those states other
than the narrow margins? Why pick those three

57:19.870 --> 57:21.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states?

57:21.705 --> 57:23.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEIN: Because the margins were narrow and
if they were hacking, those were the states

57:23.573 --> 57:25.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you would expect to see where the difference
is very close and the impact would have been

57:25.409 --> 57:26.777 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a small, statistical change that would have
changed the outcome and just left it with

57:26.877 --> 57:28.578 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a very minor difference in the votes between
the two candidates.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.414 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is not a smoking gun here, but what
the election integrity experts tell us and

57:30.514 --> 57:32.416 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the advocates for verified voting, what they
tell us, is that -- well in fact, it s not

57:32.516 --> 57:34.384 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
just them, you know, this is sort of the obvious,
the elephant s in the room. This was an election

57:34.484 --> 57:36.286 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in which we saw hacking all over the place,
we saw hacking into the democratic party database

57:36.386 --> 57:37.754 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and hacking into voter database in Illinois
and Arizona and evidence that it was attempted

57:37.854 --> 57:39.556 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
much more broadly and we also saw hacking
into personal accounts.

57:39.656 --> 57:41.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, we have a voting system
which has been proven to basically be wide

57:41.591 --> 57:43.327 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
open to hackers. That is, we have voting machines
in Wisconsin, for example, that have been

57:43.427 --> 57:45.095 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
barred from California, that got actually
made illegal in California because they have

57:45.195 --> 57:46.997 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
been proven to be drop-dead simple to go in
and reprogram with malicious software.

57:47.097 --> 57:48.832 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So we re sake you wouldn t get into an airplane
and wait for it to crash to decide you need

57:48.932 --> 57:50.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
quality assurance and a backup system. Our
voting system is no less important and we re

57:50.934 --> 57:52.102 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
basically calling for a system to verify voting.
We shouldn t have to show there s been a disaster

57:52.202 --> 57:53.704 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in order to safeguard a very vulnerable voting
system.

57:53.804 --> 57:54.471 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Green party nominee Jill Stein. Thankyou so much for joining us.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.175 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: To dig deeper into the recount push,
I m joined by David Sanger, national security

57:58.275 --> 57:59.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
correspondent for the New York Times, he has
been following this story. David, welcome,

57:59.309 --> 58:01.044 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
thanks for coming in on Thanksgiving day.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID SANGER, SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR NEW
YORK TIMES: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving

58:02.346 --> 58:04.147 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to you. We re all given thanks for Gwen s
life.

58:04.247 --> 58:04.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Absolutely, thank you. Where does this
talk come from? The sudden talk about recounts

58:05.082 --> 58:06.850 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in those three states come from?

58:06.950 --> 58:08.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: John, I think it comes from the fact
as Dr. Stein indicated the popular vote has

58:08.952 --> 58:10.687 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
now risen, it s over 2 million lead for secretary
Clinton, and the margin in the three critical

58:10.787 --> 58:12.556 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
has narrowed and that has prompted people

58:12.656 --> 58:14.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who have been looking at the hacking questions
and others to say if we were getting down

58:14.591 --> 58:15.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to such small amounts, do we need to go check
because of possibly miscounting but also because

58:15.392 --> 58:17.194 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to have the risk of hacking.

58:17.294 --> 58:19.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, when you look at Pennsylvania where the
margin is still about 70,000 or so, the chances

58:19.196 --> 58:19.763 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that this would change the result are pretty
miniscule but there may be other good reasons

58:19.863 --> 58:20.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for doing it anyway.

58:20.430 --> 58:22.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 15: 00. 1]

58:22.299 --> 58:24.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: A group of computer scientists called
the Clinton campaign last week to urge them

58:24.167 --> 58:24.501 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to do this. Do they have any evidence or any
proof that something happened in these three

58:24.601 --> 58:26.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states?

58:26.470 --> 58:28.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: They don t seem to. I think the telling
issue here is the Clinton campaign has not

58:28.305 --> 58:28.739 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
asked for a recount and I think that tells
you that they don t believe this would alter

58:28.839 --> 58:30.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the result.

58:30.674 --> 58:32.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What they do have is looking at the variance
between where a number of the pre-election

58:32.476 --> 58:34.177 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
polls were in, of course, as we all know,
those were notoriously bad in these cases

58:34.277 --> 58:36.079 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and where the vote count has come out, and
then some of the usual variances that you

58:36.179 --> 58:37.914 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
see just precinct by precinct, and there are
always some number of precincts where it looks

58:38.015 --> 58:38.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like there were several more thousand voters
who came in or several thousand fewer and

58:38.982 --> 58:40.751 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
it doesn t match up with the numbers.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It usually comes out in the wash of doing
the verification of the vote. But in Wisconsin

58:42.652 --> 58:44.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and Michigan, there are paper backups and
that s the critical thing, digitized as we

58:44.521 --> 58:46.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
get, John. Voting is one thing where you sort
of want to take a big step back and always

58:46.289 --> 58:48.091 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have a paper backup. In Pennsylvania, that s
true only in a few parts of the state.

58:48.191 --> 58:49.459 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Dr. Stein says she doesn t think this
would change the outcome and you have suggested

58:49.559 --> 58:51.395 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it s unlikely. So what s the point of going
through this?

58:51.495 --> 58:53.296 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: One point is every state has a different
system and different levels of cyber security.

58:53.397 --> 58:55.098 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And if there was one big lesson from the 2016
election, apart from the issues between the

58:55.198 --> 58:56.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
candidates, is that we are vulnerable to a
foreign power to come in and attempting to

58:57.033 --> 58:58.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
influence the election and that s of course
what the intelligence agencies were saying

58:58.935 --> 59:00.637 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
about the hacks of the DNC and John Podesta,
the chairman of the Clinton campaign s e-mails.

59:00.737 --> 59:02.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If that s the case, we have to all up our
game for sanctity of the election system.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.408 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think if states understand, that they are
going to be required to go back and look at

59:04.508 --> 59:06.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the paper ballots either on a sample or full
basis, they will probably invest more in their

59:06.376 --> 59:06.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cyber security if they believe that there
is a chance that there could be hacking, they

59:07.077 --> 59:08.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need a better system.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.647 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In this particular case, when the issue is
this narrow, if they don t go back and do

59:10.747 --> 59:12.482 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it, there will be conspiracy theories between
now and 30 years from now saying the 2016

59:12.582 --> 59:14.317 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
election, there was something suspect there.
So if they pass up this chance, they will

59:14.418 --> 59:16.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
open up to the conspiracy theories having
their case even if their case is unfounded.

59:16.153 --> 59:17.921 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: So, is it do it to prove that nothing
happened that there was no hacking?

59:18.021 --> 59:19.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SANGER: I think it s do it to be sure there
was no hacking and do it to make sure states

59:19.890 --> 59:21.725 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
recognize if they don t have the best cyber
security around which includes understanding

59:21.825 --> 59:23.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what sort of malware can come into the systems
and investing in the front end, they probably

59:23.360 --> 59:25.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
will have to pay a lot more money at the back
end if elections close.

59:25.228 --> 59:27.030 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, the way the states are doing this
right now, you only do a recount if the two

59:27.130 --> 59:29.032 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people running are within half a percent or
less of each other. For a half of an election,

59:29.132 --> 59:31.034 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
that wouldn t make sense because any sophisticated
hacker is going to know that the state s cutoff

59:31.134 --> 59:32.903 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is half of one percent and make sure the margin
is slightly larger than that to avoid an automatic

59:33.003 --> 59:34.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
recount. So you ve got to stay one thought
out ahead of some very sophisticated hackers.

Thanks for joining us.

SANGER: Thank you.

59:36.940 --> 59:38.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: The president of Colombia signed a new
peace deal with FARC rebels this morning,

59:38.842 --> 59:40.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
about six weeks after voters narrowly rejected
an earlier agreement. Days after that vote,

59:40.710 --> 59:42.412 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president Juan Manuel Santos received the
Nobel peace prize for his efforts to end that

59:42.512 --> 59:44.181 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
five-decade OLD war. For more, I m joined
from Bogota by special correspondent Nadja

59:44.281 --> 59:46.149 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Drost. Nadja, how significant were the changes
that were made after the referendum?

59:46.249 --> 59:47.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NADJA DROST, PBS CORRESPONDENT: Well, John,
the government and the FARC said they incorporated

59:48.084 --> 59:48.952 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
many if not most to have the changes that
no campaigners and opponents of the PCL had

59:49.052 --> 59:49.519 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
voiced. The current PCL. That was just

59:49.619 --> 59:51.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 20: 00. 3]

59:51.421 --> 59:53.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
signed has included over 50 changes, among
them the FARC has promised that they will

59:53.423 --> 59:55.125 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
reveal all information related to narco trafficking
and drug trafficking routes to help out law

59:55.225 --> 59:56.526 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enforcement. But could it say that many of
the changes in this new deal don t go far

59:56.626 --> 59:58.361 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enough in punishing the FARC in serious human
rights abuses.

59:58.462 --> 01:00:00.230 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For example, one to have the main arguments
is FARC leaders should not be able to run

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.065 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
for political office while still serving alternative
sentence force atrocities committed.

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.967 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Why was the government insistent on
getting it renegotiated and signed quickly?

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: There is a real sense of urgency here
to get this peace process back on track because

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
simple referendum and the PCL failed on October
2nd. We have about 7,000 FARC fighters spread

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:09.673 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
out across the country in judicial limbo and
their demobilization has been paralyzed. While

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.508 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
there is a bilateral seize fire in place,
it s fragility was demonstrated. Earlier this

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
month two FARC guerillas were killed. This
weekend at least three random activists and

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.078 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
leaders in a social movement assassinated
and another one killed this morning.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.913 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: What are the next steps? What are the
challenges in implementing this peace deal?

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: President Santos decided not to put
this new peace deal to a popular vote as he

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.750 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
did last time and it failed. Instead, he is
sending it immediately to congress for approval.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:21.518 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
While we don t yet know if the implementation
of the deal will get fast tracked into congress

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.420 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or dragged out in debates.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We know the opponents to this deal in congress
lead by former president Alavaro Uribe have

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.424 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
vowed to oppose the deal, but how much they ll
actually will be able to do in congress considering

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:27.858 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they re a minority is it s not looking very
hopeful for them to actually help any legislative

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changes.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.528 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: Nadja, this has been a bit of a roller
coaster ride, the peace agreement reached,

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.396 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rejected by the referendum, renegotiated and
signed. What s the mood of the public now?

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:35.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DROST: We re here in Bogota s main square,
the Plaza Bolivar. There is definitely a sense

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.000 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of, I would say, mild jubilation, but more
of that relief. However, I would say that

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the patience of Colombians has been really
tested out with this peace process and it

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:39.402 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hasn t been beneficial for anybody that this
peace deal has been going through so many

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:40.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stages of limbo.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:41.338 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

10 restaurants that changed America. Black

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
south Africans entering a business that was

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
brings people together. But first, the tragic
toll of substance abuses in America. A new

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:49.846 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
surgeon general s report says it s not just
the heroin and opioid epidemic that s plaguing

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.715 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the country. William Brangham has more:

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS CORRESPONDENT: According
to the surgeon general s report more than

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.552 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
27 million Americans have problems with prescription
drugs, illegal drugs or alcohol. But just

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.354 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a fraction of those people, only 10 percent,
get meaningful help. The report cites missed

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
opportunities for prevention and treatment
and it says our substance abuse costs the

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.423 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
country a staggering 440 billion a year. I m
joined by the US surgeon general Dr. Vivek

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Murthy. Dr. , thank you very much for being
here.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.693 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
VIVEK MURTHY, US SURGEON GENERAL: Really glad
to be with you.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.495 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: This is a pretty sobering report.
Millions of people suffering, very, very few

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:06.062 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people are getting help. When you compiled
all this data, were you surprised by what

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you had found?

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Well, I had seen the problem up close
as a doctor practicing medicine. When I came

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.835 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
into medicine, I expected as an internal medicine
doctor to primarily see people with diabetes,

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:12.802 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
heart disease and cancer, and I was shocked
by the number of patients who came under my

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.604 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
care who actually had substance abuse.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:15.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: You were seeing this in private
practice before being tapped to be in the

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:17.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal government?

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:17.774 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Yes, I have always seen this -- we
even -- starting in medical school itself

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:18.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and then on throughout

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 25: 00. 1]

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.545 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
my medical career, the experience was not
unique to me but many of my clinician colleagues

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.346 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
were seeing the same thing and they were really
surprised.

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.148 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When I became surgeon general and had the
privilege of travelling around the country

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and hearing people s stories firsthand, I
found that every community was touched in

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
some way by substance abuse disorders. I went
to a small fishing village in Alaska called

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:30.787 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Napaskiak which is accessible only by boat
and no roads to go there and even in this

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.589 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
small village of less than 500 people, the
small little building where they kept medications

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.558 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
had been broken into multiple times by people
seeking out prescription painkillers.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.393 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: You say in this report that we as
a nation need to think differently about addiction

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.294 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and to look at substance abuse and addiction
differently. How do we look at it now and

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.129 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
what would you like to see change?

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Unfortunately, for too many people,
addiction is a disease of choice, they see

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.899 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
as a character flaw as evidence of moral failing,
but what we know they are clearly from the

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:43.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
science, is that addiction is actually none
of those things it s a chronic disease of

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the brain.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.103 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have good scientific studies that tell
us that addiction impacts the circuits in

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
your brain and in specific parts of the brain
that affect impulse control, decision making

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.907 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and your stress and reward response. When
we understand that, we start to have a better

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:51.975 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sense of why it is so easy for people to relapse
with substance abuse disorders and why people

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.977 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
experience withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:54.811 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Can you explain -- that number really
jumps, 440 billion dollars in costs from substance

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse. How do the costs add up?

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: These costs come from several streams.
One is from direct healthcare costs. Also

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
losses in workplace productivity as well as
criminal justice system costs. The good news

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:01.451 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is we have evidence-based treatment and prevention
strategies at work. The problem is they re

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.253 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
just not getting it to enough people.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:04.721 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Why is that? You report details
quite a bit of these things that you argue

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
absolutely are proven to work but aren t being
used, why is that?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: It s really striking and it s especially
striking when you recognize it. Not only do

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.460 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we have a humanitarian reason to get treatments
to people but we know that for every dollar

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that we invest in treatment we save four dollars
in healthcare costs, seven dollars in criminal

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.296 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
justice system costs. We have prevention programs
that are proven, that can save up to 64 dollars

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.231 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
for every one dollar invested.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.133 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A part of the reason that people haven t gotten
these treatments is that, as a country, number

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.969 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
one, we haven t invested enough in expansion
of treatment programs. Number two, we haven t

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trained our clinicians widely enough in how
to recognize, diagnose and treat substance

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse disorders and, third, there is this
ongoing, unfortunate stigma around substance

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.207 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
abuse disorders that prevents people fromseeking help in the first place.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.875 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: On the prevention side, what is
it that works? What is it that we know can

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
be done to help people to stop these substanceabuse problems from developing?

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.546 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: Well, the good news is that, there
are prevention programs that don t just target

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:31.448 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
one particular kind of substance but they
can be effective reducing rates of use of

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:33.316 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
alcohol, tobacco as well as elicit substances
particularly by our youth and these programs

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.185 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are varied but some of them are school-based
programs, one called the behavior game which

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:36.987 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trains young children in how to deal with
stress in a healthy way and how to understand

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.888 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
some of these substances of misuse and understand
how to deal with them responsibly.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are also community-based programs that
focus on education and on dealing with stress

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.626 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in a healthy way. And this is a key point
which is, as I ve traveled around the country,

01:02:42.726 --> 01:02:44.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have found many times when people are using
substances or when they begin, they begin

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:46.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
trying to medicate some type of pain they re
experiencing. It may not be physical pain.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It may be emotional pain or stress they re
experiencing. If we can help equip young people

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:49.032 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in particular with healthy ways of dealing
with stress we can go a long way toward preventing

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.967 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
substance abuse disorders.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.769 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: There are many people in the treatment
and the substance abuse world who are so cheered

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by this report and it s called to action.
There are others say it is too little, too

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.539 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
late. I know Massachusetts senator Ed Markey
wrote that overdoses from the opioid epidemic

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.008 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are still rising and he says, yet this report
fails to provide any detailed road map for

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.976 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
how best to curb opioid addiction. What s
your response to that?

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.811 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MURTHY: A couple of things. Number one, in
this report we took a broad view of all substances.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.613 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We didn t just look at opioids but we also
looked at alcohol, and it may surprise many

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:04.147 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people to recognize that alcohol leads to
the other substances in terms of cost and

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lives lost.

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:06.883 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So we dealt with a range of substances. If
you read the report carefully where you understand

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:07.450 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
there is in fact a road map

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
[0: 30: 00. 2]

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:11.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for how we should approach prevention and
how we should approach treatment, there is

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.023 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
also attention to given to recovery because
what we have realized over time is that treatment

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.858 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is not a two-week process where you go in,
get cured and are good to go. Instead, we

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.793 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have to focus on long-term treatment because
this is a chronic illness. We give a fair

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.161 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
amount of attention to recovery services which
are the social supports and ongoing counseling

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:20.030 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that people need in order to reduce the amount
of relapses.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.865 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My feeling is we have a number of concrete
steps in the report that communities can take

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and we, in fact, dedicate the entire last
chapter of the report to action, to not just

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.035 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
defining the action doctors and nurses can
take but what policymakers and families and

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.936 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
law enforcement and teachers and educators
need to take.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This report has something for everyone. And
that s appropriate. Substance abuse disorders

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:29.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
touch everyone. That s something I ve seen
firsthand and we all need to play a part in

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:31.474 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
addressing addiction in America.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:31.908 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Alright. Dr. Vivek Murthy, surgeon
general of the United States. Thank you very

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:32.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MURTHY: Glad to be with you.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YANG: now, on this thanksgiving day, we devote
the rest of our broadcast to food, and a little

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:38.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine. First, economics correspondent Paul
Solman explores the histories of some of this

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.182 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
country s most iconic restaurants, and how
they reflected the cultural, social and economic

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:39.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
development of their times.

PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:
In the heart of Harlem, Sylvia s, where for

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:45.789 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
50-plus years, presidents and pop stars, tourists
and locals have feasted on down home cooking.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.090 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TREN NESS WOODS-BLACK, SYLVIA S: What we serve
here at Sylvia s is authentic, soul-food cuisine,

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.025 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rich in heritage that goes back over five
generations.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.960 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Tren ness Woods-Black is a granddaughter
of the late Sylvia Woods from South Carolina.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.829 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WOODS-BLACK: So, you re going to get the original
farm to table, which is what soul food is.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL FREEDMAN, YALE UNIVERSITY: You can t
write a book about American food without giving

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a big place to African American cuisine, which
is arguably what American cuisine is at heart.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.535 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Medieval historian Paul freedman,
who turned an academic fascination with Middle

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ages cuisine into a new career in his middle
ages, chronicling American food. His new book,

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.438 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
"Ten Restaurants That Changed America," begins
at Delmonico s in New York s financial district,

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.306 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the new nation s first real restaurant.

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:05.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: By real, I mean a place that offered
a choice. A large menu, and a fairly wide

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:05.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
range of times when the place was open instead
of saying we serve at 1:00, take it or leave

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:07.444 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:07.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: What fascinated me, as a money buff,
was how our restaurants track our economic

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:10.313 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, when Delmonico s opens in the 1830s, that s
the beginning of what we now know as the American

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy?

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.017 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: It coincides with an America of
railroads, of rapid expansion to the West,

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.885 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of industrialization and of increasing contact
with the rest of the world. It s not a place

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:16.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for people who fancy themselves as squires
or aristocrats. It s a place for enterprising

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:17.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SOLMAN: But they are wealthy.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FREEDMAN: Definitely.

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:20.390 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: The new money wanted food that was
fancy French, with new world twists. Delmonico s

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
steak, a rib-eye --

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:22.826 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: They invented Lobster Newburg. They
invented Baked Alaska.

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.427 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: They even invented brunch.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.328 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TV HOST: Delmonico s is credited with creatingthis brunch dish -- Erin.

CONTESTANT: What is Eggs Benedict?

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TV HOST: Good.

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:29.165 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: This was the place to meet and eat,well into the 20th century.

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.734 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We re going to Delmonico sfor supper, won t you join us?

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:31.701 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will it be tonight,Delmonico s or the Plaza?

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.503 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lunch at Delmonico s!

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.037 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: And men and women would show up
together at night, but at lunch, it would

01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:35.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be men only.

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.674 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Gender exclusivity, which, at the
turn of the 20th century, invited a second

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:38.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of freedman s top ten to enter the fray and
helped change America s expanding economy:

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Schrafft s.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.844 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I remember going to Schrafft s in the 50s
for the sundaes, I believe. The ice cream

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:42.779 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sundaes. That was a real treat.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.581 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: I too remember going there with
my grandmother. It s one of the first restaurants

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to cater to women, not just by providing a
safe atmosphere, but by providing the kind

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.384 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of food that women were thought to like to
eat -- light food followed by very rich desserts.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:49.085 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: But now when Schrafft s starts in
1900, what does that say about what s happening

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the American economy?

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.789 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: We see the rise of a middle middle
class of the sort that we know. They want

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:53.723 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a nice experience. They want food that is
relatively simple or not particularly French.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.592 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: A democratized middle class.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.427 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Yes, exactly. And so the restaurant
options are often for couples, you have to

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.262 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
wait for Howard Johnson s and roadside restaurants
for children really to be featured.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:01.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Number three: Howard Johnson s, now
nearly extinct, with just one upstate New

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.065 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
York outpost for fried clams and Frankforts,
down from a thousand such orange-and-blue

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:03.867 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
emporia in its mid-20th-century heyday.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:05.602 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: In the 1920s, the American dream
was not to own a house, the American dream

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:06.302 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was to own a car and to drive with your family
around to look at the countryside.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Sunday drives.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.140 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Sunday drives. Howard Deering Johnson
developed a restaurant concept that offered

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.041 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
food particularly by the side of the new highways
that were opening up for leisure driving.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:12.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: So the advent and success of Howard
Johnson s represents a further democratization

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the American economy?

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.912 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Yes, and it may be an early symbol
of the hollowing out of the middle level.

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.781 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: With HoJo s decline tracking growing
inequality.

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:19.215 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Because on the one hand you would
have very democratic places like McDonald s.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.117 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And on the other hand you have more and more
fancy restaurants.

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:22.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Hoity-toity boites like change agent
number four, Le Pavillon, where chef and owner

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.254 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Henri Soule sat A-listers up front, to see
and be seen.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:25.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: So lots of other places like La
Caravelle, La Grenouille, all of them begin

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.056 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
with Le and La, imitated this pattern.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.291 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Or number five, The Four Seasons,
birthplace of seasonal menus and the modern

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
power lunch in an increasingly financialized
economy.

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:30.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: When it started to have these power
lunches it was more media people. Advertising,

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:31.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TV, book publishing.

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.663 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
SOLMAN: That s the 60s and 70s.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.465 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: 60s and 70s. I asked one of the
owners if that was still true, if there were

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:36.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
still literary agents and authors, and he
looked at me pityingly. He looked at me as

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.034 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
if I had asked to send a telegram or where
the nearest automat was.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.302 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
SOLMAN: Because it had become high end finance.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: It s finance and real estate. Serious
money.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.839 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: There s one big apple restaurant togo: number six, Mamma Leone s.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.774 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: People say, well how can you have
Italian food in the United States represented

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.576 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by a place that was so mass market, so touristy.
That s part of the story of food in the United

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:47.410 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
States. Mamma Leone s was a pioneer of the
spectacle restaurant. And it introduced a

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lot of people to Italian food.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.880 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Marking the true globalization of
the American economy.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that was also manifest on the West Coast.
Thus, number seven, The Mandarin in San Francisco,

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.884 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
where in 1961 chef-owner Cecilia Chang introduced
people to Chinese food north and west of Cantonese.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:55.451 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Not just one province of southern
China, as had been the case with Chinese food

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:57.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to that time.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: OK, we ve reached 1971 and Freedman s
restaurant number eight. America was now rich

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
enough to start caring about something new
in its food -- how fresh it was; how safe.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:01.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thus Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California,
where chef-owner Alice Waters was the change

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:03.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agent...

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:05.228 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Changing the way many, many people
eat. It s influenced what public schools serve.

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:06.629 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s influenced what Walmart and Target have
available in their produce sections. It s

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
influenced restaurants pretty far down the
price food chain.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:09.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Number nine? Antoine s of New Orleans,
owned and run by the same family since 1840.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An example of regional American cuisine: in
this case. Creole.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:12.702 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

Back-bay Bayou Bunny Bordelais, a la Antoine.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:13.803 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: America as melting pot.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.071 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
CARTOON CHARACTER: ZE Antoine of New Orleans?

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

Flatbush!

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.974 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FREEDMAN: Regional food is part of the heritage
of America and it s something that s being

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.776 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
brought back, particularly Southern food.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.644 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SOLMAN: Which brings us back to number 10,
Sylvia s in Harlem, where the Woods family

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
carries on old traditions, and new ones, like
the timely Thanksgiving take-home package

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.447 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for an ever busier America.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.349 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WOODS-BLACK: You ve got turkey, you have dressing,
you have collard greens, macaroni and cheese,

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cornbread, sweet potato pie, you have everything
that you need that in the end, you can take

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:28.818 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a little flour and just like, put it on your

reason Americans have been eating out, ever

YANG: And now, a second helping of our food
theme. At a part of the country where ethnic

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cuisine can be found on nearly every street
corner, one entrepreneur is relying on refugees

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:40.597 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to bring their home cooking to New York City
foodies.

William Brangham is back with a visit to a
Long Island kitchen,

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.901 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT:
It s business as usual inside the kitchen

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.836 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Eat Offbeat -- a New York City catering
company. Recipes, prepared with precision

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.638 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
slicing and dicing, are cooked to perfection.
But the chefs here all have one thing in common:

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they re refugees, and none of them, until
recently, had any formal culinary training

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.308 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANAL KAHI, FOUNDER EAT OFFBEAT: Today, we
have chefs from Syria, Iraq, Nepal, Eritrea,

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:53.343 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Conakry. They re all
working each on their own dish and we have

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:55.245 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
a few deliveries happening this afternoon.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Manal Kahi created Eat Offbeat with
her brother Wissam last year. The idea came

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:58.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to them a few years before, after Kahi kept
trying different brands of American made hummus

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and nothing measured up to her grandmother s
recipe.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.085 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: I had recently moved to the U.S. from
Lebanon and I kind of missed my home. In the

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.887 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
midst of the refugee crisis back in Lebanon,
our grandmother happens to be from Aleppo,

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.889 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from Syria, originally. It was relatively
natural for us to say if you want someone

01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:07.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as talented as our grandmother to make hummus
for New Yorkers, maybe we should see the refugees

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:09.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
coming from Syria. We probably would findsomeone who s just like her.

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:11.194 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: That idea soon grew beyond just
Syrians -- Kahi believed that talented home

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:11.628 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cooks from across the globe could offer New
Yorkers unique flavors, prepared in traditional

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.365 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: Cuisines like Iraqi food, Syrian, Nepali,
Eritrean, it s not really cuisines that you

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:17.166 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can find around every corner even here in
New York, as cosmopolitan as it can be. When

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.002 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we say authentic, it s not necessarily the
way it s made in that country or it s been

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.403 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
made in that country hundred years ago. It s
the way they make it at home, the way they

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
eat it with their families. That s the way
we re selling it.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:23.573 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
BRANGHAM: Eat Offbeat partners with the International
Rescue Committee to find their chefs, and

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:25.508 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
twelve of them are now employed with the company.

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:27.343 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Because it s their first time working in a
professional kitchen, they need a bit of training,

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.678 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and so, the culinary process is overseen by
head chef Juan Suarez De Lezo. He s worked

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.546 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at some of the top restaurants in both Spain
and the U.S.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.382 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUAN SUAREZ DE LEZO, HEAD CHEF: I m teaching
them how to move in a professional kitchen,

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:34.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
how to work, how to organize, how to balance
flavors, because at the end, they ve been

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
cooking always for their families which is
amazing, but in this case, now they re cooking

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:37.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for New Yorkers. So, they need to adapt thoseflavors in somehow for the city.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:38.922 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: For Rachana Rimal, a Nepalese chef,
she s been preparing a dish that is generally

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:40.456 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
served at special occasions in her country.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RACHANA RIMAL, CHIEF, EAT OFFBEAT: This isa chicken ball, actually.

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.059 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Like a meatball?

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.127 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RIMAL: Like a meatball but I put a lot of
spices on it, like onions and my ingredients

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.995 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
here, culmi, mustard. I put everything here.

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.864 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Rimal s daughter Satakshi came to
the U.S. with her a few years ago when they

01:07:47.964 --> 01:07:49.732 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
fled Nepal as a family. She works as the kitchen
manager for Eat Offbeat. With a meticulous

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:50.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
eye, she oversees deliveries, portion sizes,
and, for the first time in her life, keeping

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her own mom in line.

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:53.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SATAKSHI RIMAL, KITCHEN MANAGER, EAT OFFBEAT:
I get to boss her around here and she gets

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:55.705 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to boss me around at home. So, I think weeven each other out pretty well.

BRANGHAM: Larry Younck is a senior refugee
resettlement officer for the United Nations

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.408 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Washington, D.C. Younck says cooking is
often a perfect job for refugees when they

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:00.276 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
first arrive to the United States.

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.111 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LARRY YOUNCK, SENIOR REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT
OFFICER, UNITED NATIONS: Refugees are expected

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to be self-supporting very quickly, a few
months after arriving here, and to find jobs

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the U.S. and that can be a challenge when
you don t speak English or you speak limited

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.617 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
English and your job skills maybe are hard
to transfer from your home country. But when

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:09.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it comes to food, food communicates regardless
of whether you can speak English or not.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.219 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Younck also believes more companies
should follow Eat Offbeat s lead when it comes

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hiring refugees.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
YOUNCK: What we see is refugees in general
in a lot of walks of life are much more entrepreneurial

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:15.391 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
than typically Americans are because, again,
they ve taken risks. They know what it is

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to try something and maybe you succeed and
maybe you don t.

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: But Manal Kahi wants her company
to go further, not just to offer jobs, but

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.763 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to help change the perception of refugees
as just being vulnerable, needy people.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.598 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KAHI: That s exactly what they re trying to
prove wrong. In our opinion, refugees are

01:08:22.699 --> 01:08:24.467 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
very skilled. They bring with them a lot of
skills, a lot of talent, a lot of heritage

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.369 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that they can share with their host communities.
And given the right opportunity, the right

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.237 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
space, they have a lot to contribute for the
local economy, and for the local communities.

01:08:28.338 --> 01:08:29.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: And for employees like Satakshi
Rimal, she says the kitchen has become a place

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.107 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
where chefs do much more than simply cook.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RIMAL: The best I could describe is it s a
second home to everybody. It s like a bunch

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of aunts coming in, cooking at a common kitchen.
And, you know, it s like joint family so you

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:36.512 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have everything that happens in a household.
There s screaming, there s, "hey, don t put

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.414 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
too much of this. Don t put so much of it."Even if that s not their dish.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.316 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRANGHAM: Eat Offbeat mainly caters to large
groups, but is hoping to expand into a delivery

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:40.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
service in the coming months. And as for the
hummus -- Kahi says her company s recipe would

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:41.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make grandma proud.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:42.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mmm, that is great.

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:43.553 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

their hands at the ancient craft in the unlikeliest

MARTIN SEEMUNGAL, PBS NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over): South Africa s breathtaking

01:08:59.302 --> 01:09:01.004 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
vineyards near Cape Town, perfectly manicured
estates spreading for miles in every direction,

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.839 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
famous for world class wines. But a world
away, from the sprawling townships on the

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.674 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
outskirts of the city -- infamous for forced
resettlement of mixed race and black South

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Africans, for crime and poverty -- you have
to look pretty hard to find a common link

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- but it is there, one little square among
a sea of shacks: a man planting a vineyard.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.246 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Manelisi Mapukata is part of an innovative
collective; growing wine grapes in small plots

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.148 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that will one day make wine. The township
winery started production using grapes from

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
those traditional winemaking areas, Sauvignon
Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinotage, but the labels

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are unique... The Flats, Philippi, names from
this part of town. Ultimately, more and more

01:09:15.418 --> 01:09:17.186 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the grapes will come from these tiny township
plots.

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.022 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANELISI MAPUKATA, VINEYARD FARMER: I feel
proud about it because if just give me enough

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:20.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time also I will learn more about grapes.
How it s important to have in our townships.

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People can learn. People can come to visitalso to see what is happening.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: The vines he is planting here won t
actually be ready to bear fruit for another

01:09:24.427 --> 01:09:25.094 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
three years, but after that, he will have
a guaranteed harvest every year, and that

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
means a guaranteed income.

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.931 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
That guaranteed income is an enormously important
project to the farmers. Many have spent years

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:30.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
growing and selling vegetables and have been
at the mercy of fluctuating prices. Those

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:31.901 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
empty rows in a section of this small plot
will soon be growing grapes and ultimately

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:32.869 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
earn annually as much as all vegetables combined.

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:34.704 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Lulama says it will change their lives.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LULAMA, VINEYARD FARMER: It means that we
want to generate more income so that we can

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
put bread on the table for our children and
the generations to come.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.876 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: They stand to double what they
are making now. The average income here is

01:09:39.976 --> 01:09:41.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
roughly $1,800 a year. Easy to understand
why people are energized, why word is spreading.

Nomhle Zondani is marketing the Township Winery
internationally, and here in South Africa,

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.214 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
she also has to manage expectations amongthese first time growers.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NOMHLE ZONDANI, MARKETER, THE TOWNSHIP WINERY:
Its not going to be an easy money making scheme.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You re not going to get rich in like two years.
So, within that five years, you will get exposure.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:50.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will bring people to say this is an idea
that we have we would love to grow it and

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:51.387 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
after five years, we would then we will have
this whatever grape we can harvest from those

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vines.

SEEMUNGAL: Graham Knox is an expert with years
of experience at all levels of winemaking,

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:56.159 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now a key partner in the township winery.
Hard as it is to believe he says the soil

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:57.994 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in these townships is perfect for wine grapes.

01:09:58.094 --> 01:09:59.796 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
GRAHAM KNOX, THE TOWNSHIP WINERY: To grow
vines in the townships brings a response of

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:01.664 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
surprise, incredulousness. And this is an
opportunity to take the land that s in the

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.599 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
township that doesn t have that huge price
tag to enable the ladies to benefit from their

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:04.167 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
works to make a living from growing vines
and grapes in a way that is completely impossible

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:06.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Stellenbosch.

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.004 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: Stellenbosch -- about an hour away
-- is home to some of South Africa s premier

01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:09.605 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine estates. Warwick is one of them, a pioneer
in its own right. Nearly 40 years ago, Warwick s

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Norma Ratcliffe was one of the first womento make wine in South Africa.

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:13.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NORMA RATCLIFFE, WARWICK WINE ESTATE: I started
with six barrels of wine, and I went through

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
all the stages that they will go through,
and a part of being a woman winemaker in those

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:17.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
days was novelty. Part of their project is
novelty which will take them quite far as

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:18.915 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
well. People come they want to have a look.
Hey, these guys are doing something neat.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.817 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: The plan is to showcase that novelty
by converting this old cement factory in one

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:21.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the townships to a winery Knox hopes that
in a few years time, it will be ready to process

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:22.885 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the grapes that will be harvested here.

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.554 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
KNOX: And start to come in to those big windows.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.389 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: He says it will be the focal pointof the township winery project.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KNOX: People who drink wine absolutely love
to visit wineries. International press and

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.959 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wine traders are fascinated by the idea that
we want to grow grapes in the township.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: And there is more to this story
than the novelty of growing grapes in the

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
township and the economic benefits it will
provide. For decades black and mixed race

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:34.464 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
south Africans were the laborers in the wine
estates. With only a few exceptions, ownership

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
has remained in white hands.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Arlene Van Wyk says her father and grandfather
were wine farm workers. She says the idea

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:38.968 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of being a winegrower was always an impossible
dream. But now, she s preparing the ground

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.770 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to plant her own vineyard.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.472 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ARLENE VAN WYK, VINEYARD FARMER: I ve been
waiting all my life. I ve been poor all my

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.373 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
life. So, now, today, even the farm workers
kids can even now become farmers.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For me, there s a big change in the last 30
years. There s a lot of white people out there

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:48.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that wants to help us as colored people and
black people. The more doors it will open,

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.045 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
more of our black people will have opportunity
to have our own vineyards, our own wine cellars

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:50.847 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and obviously sell the best wines.

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:51.481 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: Norma Ratcliffe understands the
impact apartheid had and believes this is

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an important step.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.218 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RATCLIFFE: I think its going to give these
people a lot more than a stake. I think its

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:55.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
going to give them a bit of upliftment. It s
going to say I m doing something and I m worth

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: Lulama has turned a dusty corner
of Guletu Township into an oasis of hope,

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:01.090 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and she is deeply proud, even though it is
in the middle of a poor township.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.592 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LULAMA: I don t think the beauty of the place
matters. What matters is that you do what

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:04.427 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you want to do. You want to succeed. You want
to reach your goals.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEEMUNGAL: They understand success will not
come easy. But these new winegrowers -- in

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the most unlikely of places are determined
to get there -- one tiny vineyard at a time.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.197 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour", I m Martin Seemungal

YANG: Finally tonight, another in our "Brief
But Spectacular" series where we ask. Tonight,

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.302 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we hear from Steve Cohen, owner of New York s
Second Avenue Deli, who gives us his take

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:13.936 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on the pastrami, sliced thin with the side
of schmoozing.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEVE COHEN, NEW YORK S SECOND AVENUE DELI:
You meet people in the deli, and it s like

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you re their best friend. I saw it here in
1981, right before Passover. My favorite part

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.410 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the job is meeting people, talking to people.
I have people that came in as customers and

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.078 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now they are friends. I go to their weddings,
their bar mitzvahs, and, unfortunately, I

01:11:22.178 --> 01:11:24.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go to their deaths.

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.915 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, it s a good business from a social
standpoint. As a business, it s a little difficult

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:26.549 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
kosher deli business. The food cost is quite
large. Nobody has to throw a benefit for us,

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it is a fact.

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:29.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have vats and vats of beats. It s briskets.
We have roast beefs. We have pastramis. They

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:31.420 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
have to be steamed properly. They kept properly.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.256 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, it s just a little more difficult to run
and to make money at, to tell you the truth.

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:34.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is a lot of exclusive restaurants in
New York that shall remain nameless. You go

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.592 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to those restaurants and say, look what Ihave, look what I can do.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.227 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They come to a deli and you say, you know
what? Look what we have. Look what we can

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.129 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
do. We re all a group and friends. And theytalk. It s the great equalizer.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When you come to New York, one of the reasons
is pastrami or deli. We have the matzo ball

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:42.999 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
soup. We have a fresh stock pot going.

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our pastrami is mouth watering. You just slice
thin. It s the bacaya (ph), which is a gift.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.369 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have something pacha (ph) is a pickled
calves feet and garlic. We have (INAUDIBLE),

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.271 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which is a pasta dish, like a k ration butit tastes good. It s nuts.

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:50.039 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have darma, which is stuffed darma kishka.
When I see eating kishka here, I say, when s

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.874 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the last time you ate a kishka? And they ll
say 30, 40 years ago. And they re right.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.476 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
After a meal like this, you really -- you re
quite full, but you really feel satisfied.

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.344 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
You feel like had something, and you ve connected
with the past somewhat.

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:56.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have children and grandchildren and I really
don t envy them getting up and growing up

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.514 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in this day and age. It s very difficult.
It s very hard.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.916 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now you just feel it s nice to just relax
and snooze and talk to people and get their

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.651 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ideas and their thoughts. Not so much political
but otherwise.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:02.218 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I m Steve Cohen. This is my brief but spectaculartake on schmoozing at a deli.
