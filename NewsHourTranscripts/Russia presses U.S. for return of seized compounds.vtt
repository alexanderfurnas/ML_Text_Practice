JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia
is stepping up pressure
on the United States to
regain two diplomatic

00:05.433 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compounds seized in
New York and Maryland.

00:08.833 --> 00:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama ordered them
seized in December in response
to Russian meddling in the 2016

00:14.500 --> 00:16.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

00:16.533 --> 00:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov called it highway
robbery, and his deputy held a

00:21.700 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high-level meeting at
the State Department.

00:23.733 --> 00:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick Schifrin has been
following the story, and he
joins me now in the studio.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, Nick, why are the
Russians so interested
in these two compounds?

00:30.566 --> 00:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What officials
on both sides are talking
about is bilateral irritants.

00:35.466 --> 00:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So these are the compounds.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the Russian diplomats
who were expelled last year as
part of the U.S. response to

00:44.033 --> 00:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russian hacking, and these
are not the major issues.

00:46.366 --> 00:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are not Syria and Ukraine.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea is that the fewer
issues you talk about, the
more likely it is you make

00:52.200 --> 00:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least a little progress.

00:54.366 --> 00:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are
the prospects that they can
reach any kind of agreement?

00:56.500 --> 01:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That's exactly
what the Trump administration
is trying to find, any kind

01:00.000 --> 01:02.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of agreement.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are huge headwinds,
as you know, politically
in this country if you
give back those compounds.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huge.

01:07.966 --> 01:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
so -- huge, exactly.

01:09.433 --> 01:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But U.S. officials are
worried about retribution.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia says, look, if there's no
deal today in the near future,
three dozen of your diplomats

01:18.266 --> 01:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be expelled and life
for your diplomats in
Russia will get even worse.

01:20.666 --> 01:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have already seen
a campaign of intimidation
against U.S. diplomats.

01:24.366 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Russia in June 2016, we
saw a U.S. diplomat outside
of the embassy get beaten up.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's not something the
U.S. wants to see there.

01:30.933 --> 01:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quickly,
where do you see this going?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's a
chicken and egg problem.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. says, you
hacked, we responded.

01:37.133 --> 01:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Russia were to say, no,
no, no, we didn't hack, you
kicked our guys out, you seized

01:40.866 --> 01:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our compounds for no reason,
then we retaliate, the U.S. has
to say, oh, well, this is a new

01:45.133 --> 01:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
retaliation, and yet
another response.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no telling
where that would end.

01:49.733 --> 01:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. is trying to say, look,
the big issues, keep that aside.

01:54.333 --> 01:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe we can make some progress
and at least, I don't know,
save a bad relationship from

01:59.966 --> 02:01.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getting worse.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another aspect
of the U.S.-Russia relationship.

02:02.866 --> 02:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nick Schifrin, thank you.

02:03.866 --> 02:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks.
