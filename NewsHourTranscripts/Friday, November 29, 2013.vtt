AND THEN IT HAS A COLLECTION OF 
MOONS.                          
RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE IN THE  

24:57.777 --> 24:59.472
MOONS.                          
RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE IN THE  
LOW 60s FOR MOONS, AND CASSINI  

24:59.474 --> 25:01.268
RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE IN THE  
LOW 60s FOR MOONS, AND CASSINI  
WAS GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE    

25:01.270 --> 25:02.732
LOW 60s FOR MOONS, AND CASSINI  
WAS GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE    
SYSTEM OF MOONS THAT WERE CLOSE 

25:02.734 --> 25:03.962
WAS GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE    
SYSTEM OF MOONS THAT WERE CLOSE 
IN TO THE PLANET AND THEY ALSO  

25:03.964 --> 25:05.825

IN TO THE PLANET AND THEY ALSO  
ARE LIKE A MINIATURE SOLAR
