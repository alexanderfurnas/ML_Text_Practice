JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
efforts to pass health
care reform ran into
even more roadblocks

00:04.933 --> 00:07.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this evening.

00:07.466 --> 00:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A group of key senators
balked at voting for
what some have called the
last resort, a version

00:11.666 --> 00:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
labeled skinny repeal.

00:13.733 --> 00:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This came as plans were
laid for debate and maybe
a final vote later tonight.

00:18.533 --> 00:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

00:21.966 --> 00:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A long day
of debate setting up a longer
night of votes, with Republicans

00:30.500 --> 00:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stressing the
failures of Obamacare.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAMAR ALEXANDER (R),
Tennessee: Conditions
have changed in Tennessee.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our insurance market is --
quote -- "very near collapse."

00:41.833 --> 00:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that up to 350,000
individuals in our state,
songwriters, workers, farmers,

00:47.300 --> 00:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who buy their insurance on
individual market are sitting
there worrying in July and in

00:53.233 --> 00:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
August whether they
will have any option to
buy insurance in 2018.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Democrats
insisting that Republicans'
plans could mean no choices,

01:04.300 --> 01:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
especially for the poor.

01:04.966 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Where there is a serious
disagreement is, we say that the

01:09.900 --> 01:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children of this country who
have serious illnesses have
the freedom to stay alive,

01:16.100 --> 01:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even if their parents do
not have a lot of money.

01:19.366 --> 01:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The debate
all leading lead up to a
whirlwind called vote-a-rama.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senators will take up amendment
after amendment with little
debate and five-minute votes.

01:30.766 --> 01:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All or nearly all
are expected to fail.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, at the end of the
legislative marathon,
comes the key moment.

01:37.900 --> 01:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans plan to propose the
one idea they think could pass
now: a stripped-down, minimal

01:44.200 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
repeal.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would abolish Obamacare's
individual and employer
mandates, as well as
one tax on medical

01:50.866 --> 01:53.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
devices.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would leave Medicaid and much
of the rest of the Affordable
Care Act essentially unchanged.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some on Capitol Hill call
it the skinny repeal,
but the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office

02:04.000 --> 02:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
found it would mean 15
million fewer Americans
with health insurance.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is another issue:
The CBO also found the idea
would save $78 billion.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to comply with special rules
that Republicans are using,
this plan would need to save at

02:18.566 --> 02:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
least $133 billion, the score
for the original House bill.

02:26.866 --> 02:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the votes stack up, so has
more White House pushback at
Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski,

02:33.033 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who voted against
starting debate.

02:35.666 --> 02:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First reported by Alaska
Dispatch News, Murkowski,
along with fellow Alaskan
Senator Dan Sullivan,

02:41.466 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
received grave phone calls
from President Trump's
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

02:44.566 --> 02:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He warned that the no vote
put Alaska's future with the
administration in jeopardy.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The paper speculated
jeopardy meant problems for
Alaska's energy concerns.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Murkowski is
standing her ground.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:58.666 --> 03:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA MURKOWSKI (R), Alaska:
I'm a pretty strong and
independent individual.

03:04.666 --> 03:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime, as
to the endgame, Republicans
admit, if they pass a bill, it

03:09.633 --> 03:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be a placeholder to
negotiate with the House.

03:11.133 --> 03:13.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAMAR ALEXANDER: It is not
a solution to Affordable
Care Act problems.

03:15.733 --> 03:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is its a solution
to how we get to a place
where we can write a
solution to the Affordable

03:22.233 --> 03:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Care Act problems.

03:24.066 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime,
Democrats predict a last-minute
bill would backfire.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:28.366 --> 03:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington:
If they jam it through, they
will be held accountable

03:31.366 --> 03:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the millions of people
who lose care and the millions
and millions more who will see

03:37.100 --> 03:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their premiums go up.

03:39.033 --> 03:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Everyone
on both sides is looking
at a long night.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY (R), Louisiana:
You can sleep out in the
hall in between votes.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, late
today, what we were suggesting
as we introduced your piece

03:54.933 --> 03:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is you had a group of
Republicans coming out
and saying they're not
even prepared to vote

04:01.933 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this so-called skinny
repeal, which many had thought
was going to be the last resort.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a late
and rather potentially pivotal
twist led by Senator Lindsey

04:11.466 --> 04:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Graham of South Carolina.

04:13.533 --> 04:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, John McCain was
standing there, as well as
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All three of those senators
said they will not vote for
that so-called skinny repeal

04:21.233 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or that smaller repeal bill
unless they are guaranteed
that that is not the end, that

04:28.700 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are guaranteed that
the chance to debate a
larger bill what's called
conference committee

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the House.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's critical.

04:34.466 --> 04:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that we won't see the
health care end -- the health
care debate end this weekend,

04:37.233 --> 04:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as some people were
starting to talk about.

04:39.233 --> 04:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, how did
they get to the point where
right here at the -- beyond the

04:43.866 --> 04:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
11th hour, you still
have Republican senators
saying they're not
comfortable with the options

04:49.933 --> 04:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're being offered?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
there is a graduate-level
class and probably
several in the works that

04:55.500 --> 04:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will look at that
exact question, Judy.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, from my viewpoint, one of
the issues here was that they
didn't go through the usual

05:01.533 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't go
through committees.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't have
public discussion.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They did not have
drafts of this bill.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, Judy, as I talk
to you right now, there is
still no draft of what could

05:10.233 --> 05:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be the final proposal
before senators.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to Ron Johnson, who
said he wants to improve this
bill, along with those other

05:16.700 --> 05:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators, to give more money
to states in block grants.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, when will your
amendment be drafted?

05:21.433 --> 05:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "We can't draft
it now because we don't
know what we're amending."

05:25.166 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the process itself
has led to these large questions
here near the very end.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When are the
arguments, Lisa, that are mainly
being used by the Republican

05:34.966 --> 05:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leadership, and for that
matter by the White House?

05:37.600 --> 05:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they have any presence
as this moves closer to an
attempt to pass something?

05:44.466 --> 05:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vice
President Pence has certainly
been an important factor.

05:46.266 --> 05:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was here today speaking
to small business owners.

05:48.433 --> 05:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have not seen him on
the Senate side today,
but I understand he
has been making phone

05:52.233 --> 05:53.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calls.

05:53.766 --> 05:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think the basic gist of
this, Judy, is rather simple.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican leaders in the
Senate seem to be saying,
vote for this or nothing.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is your one shot.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, they were
saying, we will add to it,
we will improve it later.

06:04.766 --> 06:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But late today, they seemed
to be saying, we actually
could pass this with the House

06:08.433 --> 06:09.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this weekend.

06:09.966 --> 06:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's another important
development to watch, Judy.

06:12.066 --> 06:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House has now signaled to
its members that they should
be ready to stay this weekend,

06:16.333 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are preparing a rule
that would allow them to pass
anything, including a health

06:19.933 --> 06:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care bill, same day.

06:21.966 --> 06:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if the Senate passes
something, the House could
pass it very quickly.

06:25.533 --> 06:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just like on the Senate,
it's not clear that the House
Republican Conference supports

06:29.833 --> 06:32.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any one vehicle.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very complicated, and right
now, it seems the last hour has
not worked to the leadership's

06:36.700 --> 06:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advantage.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we sit
here or stand here, or you stand
there, Lisa, as the evening

06:42.200 --> 06:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets under way, you're saying
this is truly up in the air?

06:46.133 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

06:47.133 --> 06:48.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It is.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it will
be a long night.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that vote-a-rama that
we explained, right now, the
timing of that is on hold.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know this, Judy.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of people
have ordered pizza.

06:54.566 --> 06:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have brought my toothbrush.

06:56.633 --> 07:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My husband doesn't know that
yet, but I think we just don't
know what's going to happen,

07:00.233 --> 07:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it will be an
important next 24 hours.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:03.600 --> 07:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Toothbrush
better than pizza.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa, thank you.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And good luck
staying up all night.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
have heard, we keep talking
about so-called skinny repeal.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at exactly
what that means.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, for that, we
bring in Sarah Kliff.

07:15.766 --> 07:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She is a senior policy
correspondent for
the Web site Vox.

07:18.733 --> 07:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has written
extensively on health care.

07:21.466 --> 07:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the program.

07:23.233 --> 07:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF, Vox: Thank you.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah, so we
are throwing around this term.

07:26.733 --> 07:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we heard from Lisa, there
are senators who are saying
even this may not be acceptable

07:31.100 --> 07:33.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

07:33.566 --> 07:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for purposes of
conversation, it is
going to be one of the
measures, we think, on the

07:36.366 --> 07:37.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

07:37.366 --> 07:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it mean?

07:39.466 --> 07:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: So, it basically
means repealing the individual
mandate, this requirement to

07:41.633 --> 07:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
purchase health coverage.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen other parts come
in, come out, the medical
device tax, defunding Planned

07:46.433 --> 07:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parenthood, but, at the
core, it's the repeal
of the requirement to
purchase health coverage.

07:50.300 --> 07:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's
rolling back some of Obamacare,
some of the Affordable Care

07:54.666 --> 07:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Act, but not as much as
full-blown repeal would be?

07:58.100 --> 08:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: It's certainly
not as much, so compared to
the other bills, the one that

08:01.233 --> 08:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passed through the House, for
example, the American Health
Care Act, which would get

08:04.133 --> 08:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rid of much more in the health
care law, the essential health
benefits, for example, this

08:08.500 --> 08:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is smaller, but it would
affect a lot of people.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and that's
what I want to ask you about,
because you wrote a piece

08:13.533 --> 08:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for Vox today which was
titled "Skinny Repeal
Isn't Skinny at All."

08:17.633 --> 08:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes, this is
a bill would cause about 15
million people to lose coverage.

08:21.833 --> 08:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I kind of say skinny repeal
is a misnomer, that this would
really change the individual

08:27.300 --> 08:29.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Medicaid expansion, that
would mostly function the same,
but for people who purchase

08:31.666 --> 08:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage in the individual
market, they could expect
premium increases of 20 percent.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of people would
drop out of the market.

08:38.266 --> 08:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think most
Americans would see that
as a skinny, small change.

08:41.666 --> 08:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
things you were writing about
is the integral role that the

08:45.533 --> 08:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individual mandate
plays in all this.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Remind us why that
matters so much.

08:50.366 --> 08:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: That's a
requirement that nearly
all of us in the United
States have to purchase

08:53.333 --> 08:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health insurance.

08:55.366 --> 08:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the draft version of the
Affordable Care Act, they
knew that was unpopular.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They included it because
they needed a way to
get healthy people into
the insurance market.

09:02.366 --> 09:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't have mandate,
the fear is that only the sick
people who really need coverage

09:05.800 --> 09:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sign up, premiums get really
high, you could enter a death
spiral, where premiums just

09:10.033 --> 09:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go higher and higher.

09:12.066 --> 09:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even Republican senators
agree on this point, that
the mandate, it is what makes

09:15.433 --> 09:16.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the market work.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It gets the healthy
people to sign up.

09:18.666 --> 09:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that explains
the number you gave at the
beginning of our conversation,

09:24.200 --> 09:26.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 15 million.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The larger repeal would
have meant 24, 25 million
people losing coverage.

09:29.866 --> 09:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're saying even
this is 15, 16 million.

09:32.866 --> 09:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes, the big
difference is Medicaid.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those other bills,
they would have ended
Medicaid expansion,
would have had much, much

09:38.466 --> 09:41.066 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
more significant
Medicaid losses.

09:41.066 --> 09:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are actually some
Medicaid losses associated with
individual mandate repeals.

09:45.333 --> 09:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO thinks that, if
there isn't a mandate,
if people don't hear this
message health insurance

09:50.033 --> 09:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is mandatory in the United
States, they might not
sign up for Medicaid.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the real challenge here
is in the individual markets.

09:55.766 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it does
sound like, with this, as we
said, late-day news conference,

10:00.533 --> 10:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lindsey Graham, other
Republicans coming out and
saying, we're not prepared

10:04.566 --> 10:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to support this unless we know
the House is going to work
with us on this, indicates that

10:08.833 --> 10:10.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're getting some
of this message.

10:10.066 --> 10:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes,
they understand.

10:12.166 --> 10:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey Graham was saying, you
know, in his press conference,
we don't think this is good

10:15.433 --> 10:17.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't think it's good to
take the individual mandate
out of the marketplace.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they recognize
these consequences.

10:21.933 --> 10:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Kliff
with Vox watching it all very
closely, thank you so much.

10:29.166 --> 10:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Thank you.
