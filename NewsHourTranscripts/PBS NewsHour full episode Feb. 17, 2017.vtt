00:16.450 --> 00:18.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skeptic, to head the EPA.

00:18.285 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, a long
journey to the
U.S. for an Iraqi interpreter
and his family,

00:23.757 --> 00:26.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at first blocked by the

ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI,
Immigrant: I was
like, it's over.

00:29.229 --> 00:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the dreams that I had,
everything that
I planned has just vanished from
my life.

00:35.636 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, nearly a
month into
the Trump administration, a
nation as divided

00:40.007 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as ever.

00:41.909 --> 00:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We travel to two cities in Texas
to hear from
Americans who support and oppose
the new president.

00:45.279 --> 00:50.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE KNOLLE, Texas: I was so
excited when
he won, because I just believed
in everything

00:50.450 --> 00:52.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he says.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISHRAT KUNDAWALA, Texas: I'm
pretty sure that
I fit almost every demographic
that's going

00:55.355 --> 00:59.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be ruined by this
administration, and I
feel like I have to speak out.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

on the president's Thursday news

01:06.667 --> 01:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the rest of the week's news.

01:08.235 --> 01:15.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's

(BREAK)

01:18.178 --> 01:27.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fresh off his
White House news
conference, the president is
out, touting

01:27.721 --> 01:29.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his first four weeks in office.

01:29.990 --> 01:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He flew to Florida today for the
holiday weekend,
with a campaign-like stop on the
way there.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

01:37.631 --> 01:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For President
Trump with
grandchildren in tow a chance to
leave Washington

01:42.536 --> 01:43.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behind.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I love South Carolina.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love it.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:49.009 --> 01:53.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: After a
roller-coaster week,
he found a friendly audience at
Boeing's North

01:53.347 --> 01:55.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Charleston plant.

01:55.182 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're here today
to celebrate
American engineering and
American manufacturing.

02:02.155 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're also here today to
celebrate jobs.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jobs.

02:07.327 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Underscoring
the point, Mr.
Trump touted the rollout of
Boeing's 787-10

02:12.032 --> 02:13.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dreamliner plane.

02:13.867 --> 02:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I campaigned on
the promise
that I will do everything in my
power to bring

02:18.472 --> 02:21.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those jobs back into America.

02:21.808 --> 02:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wanted to make much easier,
it has to be
much easier to manufacture in
our country

02:29.549 --> 02:31.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and much harder to leave.

02:31.418 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
also pushed
back at Boeing, telling
reporters its price

02:35.655 --> 02:41.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the new Air Force One and
that of Lockheed's
F-35 fighter are still too high,
and he's

02:41.528 --> 02:43.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negotiating.

02:43.430 --> 02:47.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this one day after
defending his record
at a freewheeling White House
news conference.

02:47.801 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: This
administration is running
like a fine-tuned machine.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, another
top Republican,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell, held

02:59.012 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his own news conference,
praising the Trump
agenda, but criticizing
distractions.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I
have been pretty candid with
him, and with

03:07.587 --> 03:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of you, that I'm not a great
fan of daily
tweets, but what I am a fan of
is what he's

03:13.326 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been actually doing.

03:14.828 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have not been a fan of the
extra discussion
that he likes to engage in.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we're going to soldier on.

03:25.839 --> 03:30.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We like his positions and we're
going to pursue
them as vigorously as we can.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, the
president
is back at the drawing boards on
finding a

03:33.547 --> 03:37.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security adviser, after
Michael Flynn
was forced out.

03:37.417 --> 03:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president tweeted this
morning that that
-- quote -- "General Keith
Kellogg, who I

03:41.455 --> 03:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have known for a long time, is
very much in
play for NSA, as are three
others."

03:46.726 --> 03:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whoever it is will be choice
number two, after
retired Vice Admiral Robert
Harward turned

03:51.264 --> 03:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the job, calling it a --
quote -- "purely
personal issue."

03:55.535 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't address reports that
he balked at
being denied his choice of
staffers.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House officials say the
president may
interview candidates for the
post this weekend

04:03.844 --> 04:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at his Mar-a-Lago resort in
Florida.

04:05.846 --> 04:10.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, he will hold what the
White House
calls a campaign event, in
Melbourne, Florida.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins me
now.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, campaign event?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We thought it just ended.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it hasn't.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just building up now.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the president himself
announced that
that rally in Florida will be
happening as

04:23.497 --> 04:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rally, and Sean Spicer said
last week that
that's going to be a campaign
event.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you were --
also, you
and I were talking a little
while ago, Lisa,

04:30.871 --> 04:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you were saying that some of
the people
around the president are
creating some fund-raising

04:35.342 --> 04:36.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vehicles?

04:36.343 --> 04:37.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, that's
right.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these are the things like
super PACs.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the president have
a super PAC
before, the Great America PAC,
for example.

04:43.650 --> 04:48.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now, in just the last weeks,
some of his
main campaign alums have formed
one that's

04:48.288 --> 04:51.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called the America First,
501(c)(4).

04:51.291 --> 04:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We expect more on how much money
they have
next week, but they say they're
going after

04:54.895 --> 04:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like supporting Judge
Gorsuch, Obamacare,
all of that.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one other note about the
president's campaign.

05:01.601 --> 05:06.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's so unprecedented here,
Judy, is that
he actually filed his campaign
paperwork on

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 20.

05:08.675 --> 05:15.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, for example, he
waited two
years before officially
inaugurating his reelection

05:15.448 --> 05:16.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is unprecedented
territory.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really
interesting.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know reporters will
continue to ask
him about it.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, thank you.

05:22.289 --> 05:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The U.S. Senate confirmed
President Trump's

05:26.126 --> 05:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pick to lead the Environmental
Protection
Agency 52-46.

05:30.263 --> 05:34.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Pruitt was Oklahoma's
attorney general,
and in that role, he's
repeatedly sued the

05:34.868 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EPA to rein in regulations.

05:37.470 --> 05:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats tried, and failed, to
delay today's
confirmation vote until Pruitt
releases thousands

05:41.775 --> 05:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of e-mails with oil and gas
executives.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: It's
not the worst thing in the world
to take a

05:47.480 --> 05:53.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few extra days to properly vet
someone who
will have immense power over our
nation's

05:53.553 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
streams, skies, even the lead
level in our
homes and water supply.

05:59.159 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those e-mails could contain
material information
about his confirmation.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BARRASSO (R), Wyoming:
Government agencies
like the EPA, and one after
another, need

06:07.968 --> 06:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their leadership in place, and
they need it
in place now.

06:14.407 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they don't need, what the
American people
don't need is more political
theater from

06:19.479 --> 06:21.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Senate Democrats.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pruitt was
strongly opposed
by environmental groups, who
warn he will

06:24.117 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
roll back enforcement efforts.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was sworn in this afternoon.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look right
after the
news summary.

06:30.190 --> 06:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Pakistan, the
military says
it killed more than 100 people
it calls terrorists

06:35.395 --> 06:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in sweeping anti-terror raids.

06:37.797 --> 06:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They came a day after a suicide
bombing, claimed
by the Islamic State, killed at
least 88.

06:43.536 --> 06:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protesters took to the streets
today to denounce
weak security.

06:48.275 --> 06:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pakistan has been hit by a spate
of deadly
attacks in recent days.

06:53.647 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another Islamic State bombing
killed 59 people
in Iraq yesterday.

06:58.018 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The World
Meteorological
Organization reports the sea ice
pack in the

07:02.589 --> 07:06.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arctic and Antarctic was the
smallest ever
for the month of January.

07:06.426 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. agency also says
concentrations of
heat-trapping carbon dioxide hit
a record.

07:11.564 --> 07:15.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, NASA satellites
captured part of
the ice loss.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the Pine Island Glacier
in Antarctic
earlier in January.

07:19.272 --> 07:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A separate image showed an

of Manhattan that broke away on

JUDY WOODRUFF: A powerful new

into California today, bringing
what could

07:30.450 --> 07:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the heaviest rain in years.

07:32.986 --> 07:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rain and high winds lashed
the Southern
California coastline,
threatening flooding

07:38.258 --> 07:41.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and mudslides, and forcing
small-scale evacuations.

07:41.828 --> 07:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm is expected to skirt
Northern California,
but officials kept watch on the
Lake Oroville

07:48.068 --> 07:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dam and its damaged spillways.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CROYLE, California
Department of Water
Resources: We have a very close
communication,

07:53.340 --> 07:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our monitoring teams, between
our incident
commanders to make sure that we
have all eyes

07:59.045 --> 08:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on this and we're ready to take
action with
our mitigation plan.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see that that's a risk
at this time.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, having said that, we're
ready.

08:07.887 --> 08:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another storm
system is expected
to hit Northern California late
Sunday night

08:12.826 --> 08:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and could bring 30 hours of
precipitation.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wall Street
headed into
the President's Day weekend with
a lackluster

08:18.998 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained four
points to close at 20624.

08:23.503 --> 08:28.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 23 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added almost four.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained 1.5
percent or better.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a passing of
note.

08:33.980 --> 08:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A longtime former minority
leader of the House
of Representatives, Bob Michel,
has died.

08:39.319 --> 08:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Illinois Republican served
19 terms, but
retired just before the GOP won
back the majority

08:46.726 --> 08:48.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the House in 1994.

08:49.028 --> 08:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is credited with helping
President Reagan
and the first President Bush
push their agendas,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by negotiating with Democrats.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bob Michel was 93 years old.

08:58.772 --> 09:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two Texas
cities, a microcosm of the
nation's deep political

09:05.512 --> 09:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divide; Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze
the week's news; an actor caught
up in the

09:11.584 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oscars-so-white controversy
stars in a new
film about controversial love;
and much more.

09:23.129 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now that Scott
Pruitt is
in charge of the EPA, we take a
look at what

09:32.705 --> 09:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to expect from the agency under
his leadership
with Myron Ebell, director of
the Competitive

09:37.944 --> 09:40.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Enterprise Institute, a
libertarian advocacy
group.

09:40.814 --> 09:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He oversaw President Trump's EPA
transition
team and has been a vocal
opponent of many

09:46.019 --> 09:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the agency's policies.

09:47.887 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Jeremy Symons of the
Environmental Defense
Fund, a group strongly opposed
to Pruitt's

09:52.459 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
confirmation.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, Myron, let me start
with you.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're someone that thinks that
climate science
in some ways is alarmist.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're not here to debate
that tonight.

09:59.566 --> 10:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have you on because you
likely have insight
into why Scott Pruitt is head of
the EPA today.

10:04.270 --> 10:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my first question to you is,
is someone
who shared your views on climate
science,

10:10.076 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was that one of the
preconditions and prerequisites
to get this job and make you
interested in

10:13.446 --> 10:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting that person the head of
the EPA?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MYRON EBELL, Director,
Competitive Enterprise
Institute: I wasn't involved in
the personnel

10:17.750 --> 10:20.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decisions of the Trump
transition.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not a part of the Trump
administration.

10:24.090 --> 10:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what President
Trump was looking
for when he nominated Scott
Pruitt was someone

10:30.430 --> 10:37.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would be a really able
advocate and implementer
of the president's agenda for
the EPA, and

10:37.837 --> 10:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Scott Pruitt is a great
choice.

10:39.672 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is the
first time in
the EDF history that you have
gone out and

10:43.710 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposed the nomination.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

10:46.546 --> 10:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY SYMONS, Environmental
Defense Fund:
Well, it's because Scott Pruitt
is so extreme.

10:48.348 --> 10:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this fight isn't over,
because when you
look at his record of suing the
EPA that he's

10:52.886 --> 10:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now going to lead 14 times to
undermine clean
air and clean water protections,
that doesn't

10:58.825 --> 11:02.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bode well for what he is going
to try to do
when he gets in.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Myron got his man, right?

11:04.764 --> 11:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, this is
about protecting
public health.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the Environmental
Protection Agency.

11:10.169 --> 11:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have someone at the head
now who wants
to take the agency backward,
instead of forward.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's not good for
children's health.

11:16.609 --> 11:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not good for protecting the
elderly or
anyone who is vulnerable to air
pollutions,

11:20.346 --> 11:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to toxic chemicals or to water
pollution like
lead.

11:22.649 --> 11:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Myron, you
said the president's
positions, and this is what was
most important.

11:26.219 --> 11:30.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president on the campaign
trail, even
on a debate stage said that he
would like

11:30.056 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to cut the EPA down
significantly.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why does Scott Pruitt help the
president advance
that agenda?

11:37.363 --> 11:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRON EBELL: Scott Pruitt has
been a very
strong advocate for devolving
more of the

11:43.102 --> 11:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work of the EPA to the states.

11:45.705 --> 11:51.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the EPA already
has the states
doing a lot of its work, but it
still has

11:51.744 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a very large bureaucracy
nonetheless.

11:54.314 --> 12:00.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Scott Pruitt understands
that the
EPA can be a lot smaller than it
is and we

12:00.253 --> 12:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will still have the same levels
of environmental
protection for clean air and
clean water,

12:06.092 --> 12:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because the states are already
doing the work.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The EPA has
shrunk even
under President Obama's term.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can it be even smaller?

12:13.900 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY SYMONS: Look, we have
worked with the
Environmental Protection Agency
across Republican

12:17.370 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Democratic presidents.

12:20.073 --> 12:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not an issue of --
where we go from
here has to be maintaining EPA's
capability

12:28.214 --> 12:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and capacity to get the job
done.

12:30.617 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Pruitt, when he took over
as attorney
general in Oklahoma, he got rid
of the environmental

12:36.122 --> 12:37.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enforcement division.

12:38.024 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he does that for the EPA,
that means trouble
anywhere in this country from
Florida to Ohio.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to make sure that we
remain vigilant
and that we hold the senators
that voted for

12:48.935 --> 12:53.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him by the narrowest of margins
and Scott
Pruitt accountable for what he
does.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeremy Symons,
what are
the most immediate things that
you're concerned

12:56.242 --> 12:57.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about?

12:57.310 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can Scott Pruitt do once he
is in the
job?

12:59.212 --> 13:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is one individual, it's a
large agency,
the rules take time to change.

13:03.483 --> 13:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY SYMONS: Well, Myron and
the transitions
recommended that they cut the
EPA by half.

13:08.254 --> 13:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking gutting core
capacities like
enforcement, like science, the
health studies

13:13.126 --> 13:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that need to happen to make sure
that pollution
is controlled.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're worried about enforcement,
like what
he did in Oklahoma.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're worried about interfering
with science.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look just at the
lawsuits that
Scott Pruitt filed to try to
roll back things

13:25.371 --> 13:30.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like mercury standards, arguing
that mercury
isn't a threat to the unborn --
because it

13:30.276 --> 13:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, and science says it is, and
quite clearly
across many studies.

13:34.914 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you add all those lawsuits
up, if you took
away those rules he was
attacking, we would

13:40.486 --> 13:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see 850,000 more asthma attacks
every year.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is unacceptable.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're going to be keeping
score in terms
of, are we moving forward or
moving back?

13:51.597 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pruitt that we saw in front
of the Senate
said he cared about EPA's
mission and would

13:55.868 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move us forward, but his record
says otherwise.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're waiting to see which
Pruitt shows up.

14:00.173 --> 14:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Myron, one of
the concerns
has been Mr. Pruitt's record.

14:04.711 --> 14:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Competitive Enterprise
Institute is in
some ways funded by the fossil
fuel industry,

14:09.415 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Scott Pruitt was a friend to
the fossil
fuel industry, to put it mildly,
in Oklahoma.

14:15.455 --> 14:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a famous incident of
him basically
copy-pasting an e-mail or a
concern from the

14:21.561 --> 14:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
energy -- directly to the EPA.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is he likely to do?

14:25.431 --> 14:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because at the hearings, he said
that he understands
that it is an incredibly
important job, especially

14:30.937 --> 14:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to the role in
regulating CO2.

14:33.506 --> 14:38.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MYRON EBELL: Jeremy has
mentioned these 14
lawsuits.

14:38.578 --> 14:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm proud that my organization,
CEI, is a
co-plaintiff with Attorney
General Scott Pruitt

14:44.317 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in several of these lawsuits.

14:45.918 --> 14:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are meant to shrink EPA's
overreach,
its illegal regulatory
overreach.

14:53.493 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when you look at
Oklahoma, Oklahoma
is a big oil and gas producer.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're proud of it.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They produce the energy that we
use.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course Scott Pruitt supports
that industry.

15:06.305 --> 15:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's Oklahoma's major industry,
and it helps
the entire nation.

15:10.276 --> 15:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, if you look back at
what President
Trump said in the campaign, he
said, I want

15:15.882 --> 15:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get rid of the regulatory
rampage that
is killing investment and jobs
in our resource

15:22.889 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and manufacturing industries,
and I want to
make America the world's energy
superpower.

15:29.195 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think Scott Pruitt will
have a vital
role in shrinking that
regulatory rampage.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does his
thinking change
when it's just not Oklahoma and
a specific

15:38.571 --> 15:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industry that he's protecting as
state's attorney
general, but now the entire
country that has

15:42.642 --> 15:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lots of different sources of
energy, but also
a much larger constituency?

15:45.845 --> 15:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYRON EBELL: Yes, of course.

15:48.080 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Trump campaign wasn't
just about Oklahoma
or the oil and gas industry.

15:53.986 --> 16:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was about rebuilding our
resource and manufacturing
industries across the heartland
of America.

16:00.393 --> 16:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is going to require
putting EPA regulations
back in their place, so that
they're concerned

16:05.364 --> 16:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with air and water pollution,
and not destroying
jobs.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Myron Ebell from
the Competitive Enterprise
Institute, Jeremy

16:11.938 --> 16:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Symons from the Environmental
Defense Fund,
thank you both.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MYRON EBELL: Thank you.

16:16.042 --> 16:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEREMY SYMONS: Thank you.

16:22.949 --> 16:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On January 27,
the president's
executive order banning travel
from seven

16:31.457 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim-majority nations went
into effect,
throwing plans to travel to the
U.S. into

16:37.129 --> 16:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chaos for many people in the
Middle East.

16:40.032 --> 16:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right afterward, we introduced
you to one
Iraqi man who had long worked
for the American

16:45.338 --> 16:50.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
military, whose plans to
immigrate here with
his family were suddenly
canceled.

16:50.443 --> 16:55.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, from Southern
California, special
correspondent Marcia Biggs
brings us this

16:55.514 --> 16:57.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
update.

16:57.316 --> 17:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: This is the day
Abdul Hamid
Abdul Ghani and his family have
waited years

17:03.723 --> 17:05.024 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're driving towards the
airport in Irbil,
Northern Iraq.

17:06.926 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI,
Immigrant: I feel
like a big burden is off my
shoulder, and

17:13.933 --> 17:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can take my family to a place
where I can
feel safe.

17:18.304 --> 17:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Abdul Hamid and
his family are
finally coming to the U.S., on
special immigrant

17:24.043 --> 17:27.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visas issued to Iraqis who
worked for the
U.S. military.

17:27.780 --> 17:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent nine years as an
interpreter for
the U.S. military, at great
personal risk,

17:33.286 --> 17:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even finding himself on a kill
list back in
2006.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yet he still proudly wears the
American flag.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you like working with the
Americans?

17:41.427 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: Oh, I
loved it.

17:43.195 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The brotherhood they have, this
type of mentality,
like we are one team and one
fight.

17:48.467 --> 17:52.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They never gave me this
impression like, you
are not one of us, or you are
just an interpreter

17:52.838 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're going to do your job,
and they're
going to leave me behind.

17:56.075 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Three weeks ago,
with bags packed
and having sold everything he
owned, he got

18:02.214 --> 18:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the news that President Trump's
executive
order on immigration meant that
the visa he

18:06.819 --> 18:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had waited almost six years to
get would be
canceled.

18:09.722 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: I
really was shocked,
like somebody just popped me in
the head.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was like, it's over.

18:16.762 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the dreams that I had,
everything that
I planned has just vanished from
my life.

18:22.969 --> 18:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even my little kids kept asking
me or looking
at the TV and he was like, hey,
daddy, why

18:27.406 --> 18:28.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is Trump stopping us?

18:28.541 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is this guy stopping us from
going to
the States?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I had no answer for him.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Because you
believed in this
brotherhood that you had been a
part of for

18:37.550 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so long?

18:38.551 --> 18:39.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI:
Exactly.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have had this feeling like
someone is going
to stand for me.

18:42.521 --> 18:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the America that I know is
totally different
from the decisions that have
been made lately

18:47.827 --> 18:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by those executive orders.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was like, this is not
America.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Someone did stand
up for him.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protests erupted all over the
country.

18:57.903 --> 19:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just under a week later, the
Pentagon
recommended that the ban be
amended to allow

19:03.142 --> 19:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visa holders who worked for the
U.S. military
to immigrate.

19:06.512 --> 19:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, once again, the family
prepared to travel.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And half-a-world away, another
family is preparing.

19:13.819 --> 19:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sattar Khidir, one of Abdul
Hamid's best friends,
has been living here in San
Diego for the

19:18.924 --> 19:20.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last 5.5 years.

19:20.693 --> 19:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a former contractor for the
U.S. Air Force,
he immigrated on the same type
of visa.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Abdul Hamid helped him and many
others fill
out their visa applications.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And he did all of
this just
out of the kindness of his
heart?

19:31.904 --> 19:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SATTAR KHIDIR, Immigrant: Yes.

19:32.905 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: He's a good man.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SATTAR KHIDIR: He is a great
man.

19:35.474 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, is this an
opportunity to
give back to him?

19:39.045 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will do whatever it costs to
just help him
out.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will do my best.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It hasn't been
easy for Sattar,
either.

19:49.021 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He arrived in 2011, and has
struggled to find
steady work in an area of the
country where

19:54.493 --> 19:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the cost of living is high.

19:56.228 --> 20:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Some people, they
don't know
how is life in California.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nice weather, I know.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's nice weather.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then what are you going to
do?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have to search for a job.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there's no jobs.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And you have told
him this?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have been honest with him?

20:11.143 --> 20:12.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I told him.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told him, Abdul Hamid, I speak
five language.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You speak barely three language.

20:17.249 --> 20:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't find any jobs for me
like translating
because there is a lot of
translators over

20:23.923 --> 20:25.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Abdul Hamid and
his family are
moving to this suburb of San
Diego, which

20:28.894 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has more Iraqi refugees than
anywhere else
in the United States.

20:33.566 --> 20:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This main street could be in
Anytown, USA,
yet it's been nicknamed Little
Baghdad.

20:38.737 --> 20:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last five years, over
8,000 Iraqi refugees
have been resettled in the
greater San Diego

20:43.375 --> 20:44.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's almost 10 percent of
total arrivals
nationwide.

20:46.879 --> 20:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A local resettlement agency has
found Abdul
Hamid an apartment, but it's not
ready yet.

20:53.119 --> 20:58.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the rent is $1,500 a month,
almost a quarter
of a one-time allowance given to
them by the

20:58.991 --> 21:00.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
State Department.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, this is where
they will
be staying?

21:01.293 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: While he waits,
Sattar, his
wife and two children are making
space in

21:05.931 --> 21:09.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their two-bedroom apartment for
Abdul Hamid's
family of five.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: This is your room?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And now your whole
family's
going to be in here?

21:13.539 --> 21:14.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:15.541 --> 21:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's going to be
tight.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes, I know that,
but we're
going to be fine.

21:19.912 --> 21:20.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what I can do.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we will have fun.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: You will have fun?

21:23.415 --> 21:25.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SATTAR KHIDIR: Yes.

21:25.251 --> 21:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Back in Iraq, the
family sets
off on the 24-hour journey to
the other side

21:29.989 --> 21:31.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an emotional departure.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
hope life will
be better.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hope our children's education
will be better.

21:38.764 --> 21:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm so sad that I won't be
able to see
my mother.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And fear is never
far from their
minds.

21:45.271 --> 21:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: I
always had this
doubt, like, because it
happened.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened like a couple weeks
ago.

21:52.278 --> 21:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people were airborne and
they have been
stopped from entering into the
United States.

21:56.949 --> 22:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I absolutely had this fear like
maybe something
is going to pop up at the very
end of my journey.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: It was a
nail-biter on this
end as well.

22:07.026 --> 22:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, finally, the moment Abdul
Hamid says
he'd been worried would never
happen.

22:12.131 --> 22:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: When I
first got
off from the airport and I
looked around to

22:19.905 --> 22:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see Sattar and I actually saw
him, it's kind
of hard for men to cry, but I
actually cried.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was an amazing moment.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that I'm not
going to forget
it in my lifetime.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will never forget that moment.

22:36.789 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The morning after,
a hectic
and happy scene in the kitchen,
old friends

22:41.860 --> 22:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reunited over the breakfast
table, but in
a new world.

22:45.231 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: First
thing in the
morning, I took a step outside
and took a

22:48.567 --> 22:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really long breath and looked
around.

22:51.870 --> 22:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I told myself, yes, it is
true, and I
am here in the United States of
America.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: What do you want
for your family
in general?

22:59.044 --> 23:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: I want
a brighter
future for my family, especially
my Down syndrome

23:03.782 --> 23:05.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kid.

23:05.584 --> 23:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I'm most worried about,
if they start
talking about this ban again or
they start

23:10.956 --> 23:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- if anybody starts to make a
difference
between all of these types of
religion, like

23:15.861 --> 23:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- or make it hard for Muslims,
then I'm going
to be suffering.

23:19.531 --> 23:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: You're more
worried about discrimination
than you are about getting a job
and an apartment

23:24.503 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

23:25.504 --> 23:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: Yes, I
know.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know it's meant for me to be
here.

23:28.340 --> 23:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm kind of worried about
getting a job,
but I will get a job one day
soon, hopefully.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like the Iraqis say, inshallah.

23:35.948 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: But with the goal
of finally
reaching this country, the fear
began to settle

23:40.719 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

23:42.521 --> 23:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With little money and a small
dispensation
from the government, Abdul Hamid
has to make

23:46.625 --> 23:48.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a life for his family.

23:48.494 --> 23:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID ABDUL GHANI: I know
there's a
lot of folks who are coming out
here as immigrants

23:51.697 --> 23:53.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and as refugees.

23:53.799 --> 23:59.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I know the opportunity of
getting a job
is going to be hard.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I believe in myself and I
believe in my
destiny.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think I will be good.

24:04.209 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will do my best to be good.

24:05.978 --> 24:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in San Diego,
California.

24:15.721 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Public opinion
polls show
we live in a deeply divided
country, particularly

24:25.964 --> 24:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it comes to politics.

24:27.966 --> 24:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been four months since the
election,
and just a few weeks into the
new Trump administration.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So how are voters responding?

24:33.872 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham is just
back from a reporting trip to
Texas.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's here with me now.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what exactly did you set out
to do?

24:39.978 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We wanted to
talk to voters
on both sides of the political
spectrum.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, we were in Texas.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We went to two very different
places.

24:46.952 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I asked people basically
four or five,
six questions, identical
questions in both

24:50.689 --> 24:52.391 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

24:52.424 --> 24:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you will see, it's as if
voters are
living in two completely
different worlds.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a look.

24:57.896 --> 25:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bellville,
Texas is a small
rural town an hour's drive from
Houston.

25:03.535 --> 25:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its streets are lined with
single-family homes
and locally owned shops.

25:07.673 --> 25:12.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a recently-renamed
restaurant in town
has become something of an
attraction, the

25:12.745 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump Cafe.

25:14.213 --> 25:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you changed the name to
Trump Cafe two
weeks before the election?

25:17.182 --> 25:18.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HAWA, Owner, Trump Cafe:
Before, yes,
sir.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And what if
Trump hadn't
won the election?

25:19.985 --> 25:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HAWA: We don't -- you know,
actually,
we pray for God to he wins.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm so glad he win.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm so glad, you know?

25:28.460 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So if Hillary
Clinton had
won, would this be Clinton Cafe?

25:32.097 --> 25:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUE HAWA: No, I will move back
home.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sue Hawa owns
the place
with her husband.

25:37.102 --> 25:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump memorabilia is everywhere.

25:40.806 --> 25:45.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big seller on the menu is
the Trump Burger,
onion rings, barbecue sauce,
bacon, topped

25:45.544 --> 25:47.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with an American flag.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you might imagine, the Trump
Cafe is full
of Trump supporters; 80 percent
of the county

25:52.017 --> 25:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here voted for the president.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How was election night for you?

25:55.287 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY, Texas: Oh, it was
great.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Man, I was on cloud nine.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was a Trump guy from day one.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is that right?

26:02.528 --> 26:03.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day one?

26:03.529 --> 26:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY: Yes, from day one.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soon as he said it, I was like,
we need something
other than a politician.

26:07.966 --> 26:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE KNOLLE, Texas: I was so
excited when
he won, because I just believed
in everything

26:12.471 --> 26:14.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he says.

26:14.306 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were so ready for a
change, and he
listened to the people.

26:18.677 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A hundred
miles west, and
a political world apart, is
Austin, the state

26:24.450 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capital, a liberal outpost in
this red state.

26:27.619 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visited what is perhaps
Austin's version
of the Trump Cafe, the Bouldin
Creek Cafe,

26:32.491 --> 26:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a vegetarian place in South
Austin.

26:35.494 --> 26:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two-thirds of the county here
voted for Hillary
Clinton.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chesley Allen is the general
manager.

26:40.966 --> 26:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHESLEY ALLEN, Bouldin Creek
Cafe: It's kind
of the nexus, or the heart of
what people

26:45.237 --> 26:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think of when they think of
Austin as the
offbeat, funky, keep Austin
weird, that sort

26:50.776 --> 26:51.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of thing.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's where
we are?

26:53.579 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHESLEY ALLEN: That's where you
are.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The day after
President
Trump's inauguration, the cafe
donated profits

26:59.318 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the ACLU, the Southern
Poverty Law Center
and Planned Parenthood.

27:03.255 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISHRAT KUNDAWALA, Texas: Because
I'm pretty
sure that I fit almost every
demographic that's

27:07.659 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be ruined by this
administration,
and I feel like I have to speak
out.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What was
election night
like for you?

27:13.932 --> 27:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISHRAT KUNDAWALA: Brutal,
devastating, heartbreaking.

27:15.801 --> 27:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRYSTLE PAPIC, Texas: If I were
to have a
nightmare that night, then my
nightmare would

27:21.206 --> 27:24.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be a reality, because I
definitely didn't
want Trump to win.

27:24.042 --> 27:28.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DYLAN STONECIPHER, Texas: My big
fear with
him is that he is coming out
fast and hard

27:28.614 --> 27:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a lot of big stuff, but I
really, truly
believe that he is just trying
to tire out

27:33.652 --> 27:35.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his opposition.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To spend a few
hours in
these two places, talking to
people on either

27:38.524 --> 27:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the political divide, is
to see just
how deep the chasm is in our
politics.

27:44.229 --> 27:47.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What have you made of his
Cabinet picks so
far?

27:47.065 --> 27:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I love every one of them.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Every one of
them?

27:50.202 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I love Betsy DeVos.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love her.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope she does something about
education.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I love Sessions, Jeff Sessions.

27:56.742 --> 27:57.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is not a racist.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just ridiculous.

27:59.711 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISHRAT KUNDAWALA: I don't know
how he could've
picked more unqualified people
to run things

28:04.516 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the Education Department,
or Rick Perry
for Energy.

28:09.221 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a direct mirror of how much
money -- how
much of a role money plays in
politics.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The politics
of the team
running the White House,
including Steve Bannon,

28:19.765 --> 28:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former chairman of Breitbart
News, has been
a source of controversy.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been a lot of questions
raised recently
about Steve Bannon.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is your...

28:28.073 --> 28:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I love Steve Bannon.

28:29.575 --> 28:30.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think he's great.

28:30.842 --> 28:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says what he says, means what
he says.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why they don't like
him.

28:36.081 --> 28:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who are just namby-pamby
little me,
me, they don't like people who
are outspoken.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have any
thoughts on
Steve Bannon?

28:41.820 --> 28:42.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

28:42.821 --> 28:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the devil incarnate.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The devil
incarnate?

28:45.857 --> 28:48.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, he got the man
elected.

28:48.827 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I guess he got a payback,
so he made
himself an adviser.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But everything he stands for, I
do not.

28:56.535 --> 29:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I have a lot of Muslim
friends, and
friends who are also people of
color, and

29:03.976 --> 29:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it's just very disturbing to
me how it
could have progressed to such a
state.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Patrons of
these restaurants
are also split on the news they
trust.

29:12.818 --> 29:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are your three or four main
sources of
news?

29:16.455 --> 29:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISHRAT KUNDAWALA: I would say
The Guardian,
CNN, and, ironically -- I,
ironically, like

29:23.228 --> 29:24.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PBS and NPR.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I listen to NPR every
morning.

29:26.531 --> 29:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY: I think it's great
that he's on
Twitter, because now we know
what he is thinking

29:31.737 --> 29:32.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

29:32.738 --> 29:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No filter
there.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY: Yes, there's no
filter.

29:35.574 --> 29:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON BOYLE, Texas: It's pretty
much a bet that
a mainline journalist is going
to be not a

29:39.611 --> 29:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservative, be more in the
school of being
progressive and everything.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Where are the
main sources
of -- when you want to find out
what is going

29:47.953 --> 29:48.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on?

29:48.954 --> 29:49.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: FOX.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: FOX News.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I will not look at CNN.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get ill.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Straight-up
FOX News viewer.

29:56.662 --> 29:57.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I'll tell you what I did.

29:58.730 --> 30:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a brother that watches
FOX News constantly.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's on 24 hours a day, I
think, at his
house.

30:06.638 --> 30:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They came here to Austin to
visit me over
Christmas, and the room he was
staying in

30:13.045 --> 30:14.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has a TV.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on the cable box, I blocked
that station.

30:16.481 --> 30:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY: I have a sister who
can't stand
the guy, and we still talk, but
I try not

30:26.892 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to talk politics with her.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, she's
still your sister,
though?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHIL OXLEY: Yes, she's still my
sister.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's always going to be my
sister.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We just don't discuss it.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:35.834 --> 30:37.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: We don't get into
politics.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You know each
other's views,
and you don't talk about it?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

30:41.206 --> 30:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I respect their views and I
don't -- we just
don't talk politics.

30:45.110 --> 30:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The couple who
runs the
Trump Cafe say there's a reason
they're open

30:49.915 --> 30:51.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to all diners.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their own story seems to cross
political divides.

30:54.820 --> 31:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're a Palestinian Muslim
couple that
owns a cafe in Texas named the
Trump Cafe.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You understand how some people
might think,
that sounds like a bizarre
combination.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUE HAWA: I like my president.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Actually, I like him because
he's a businessman.

31:10.936 --> 31:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He know how to do business, you
know?

31:14.106 --> 31:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, what he is trying
to do, it's
excellent.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now, do you
let Democrats
eat here?

31:19.277 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE HAWA: You know, welcome to
-- yes, you
know, welcome to everyone like
to come inside

31:24.716 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my restaurant.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

31:27.519 --> 31:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE HAWA: My door open for
everybody, you
know, Republican, Democratic,
same, you know.

31:31.523 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

31:37.062 --> 31:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

31:51.109 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David, to you first.

31:59.117 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was quite a report from
William Brangham,
two towns in Texas, two groups
of people,

32:04.856 --> 32:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both sides of the political
aisle.

32:06.491 --> 32:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does it tell you about just
how divided
this country is?

32:09.261 --> 32:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, welcome to
life in America
these days.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those of us who have been
traveling around,
that's reality.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And two things strike me.

32:17.169 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is, politics is based
on social
identity, and so, again, there
is going to

32:22.274 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be differences between rural and
urban and
between left and right.

32:26.645 --> 32:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's at the core, why is
the chasm so
wide between the two and why are
the two universes

32:32.150 --> 32:34.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost non-overlapping?

32:34.719 --> 32:39.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like whether we're just
in-group, out-group,
or is there some cultural or
ethnic or racial

32:39.624 --> 32:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
divide that's at the bottom of
this?

32:41.827 --> 32:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard to figure out
what unconsciously
is making people so fervently in
one universe

32:46.198 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or the other.

32:47.999 --> 32:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whether it's an identity
politics thing,
or just we that like to form
groups and we

32:51.369 --> 32:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to unify our group by
hating some other
group, that's the world we're
in.

32:54.773 --> 32:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, they
couldn't have
been more divided than they
were.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They weren't.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were characteristically
Texan.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were outspoken.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They didn't hide their
allegiance or their
enmities.

33:06.852 --> 33:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought a particular act
of fraternal
love was disabling the FOX News
Channel when

33:13.425 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his brother came to visit over
Christmas,
not exactly a loving act, it
would seem, but

33:21.099 --> 33:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that he boasted about
to William
on national television.

33:24.502 --> 33:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what all of
them are
reacting to is what's been going
on here in

33:28.139 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, David, certainly
during the campaign,
but since.

33:32.010 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard them saying they love
-- the ones
who like Donald Trump, they love
his Cabinet

33:36.081 --> 33:37.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
picks.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They like his staff.

33:38.850 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But during this past week, the
president's
had a rough go of it, certainly
losing his

33:43.121 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security adviser,
Michael Flynn being
forced out, and then the man the
president

33:48.960 --> 33:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to have replace him
announce publicly
that he wasn't going to take the
job.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of how the
president did
this week?

33:57.302 --> 34:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, to me, the
big chasm of
the week is the gap between the
circus act

34:02.374 --> 34:03.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the substance.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The press conference was its own
thing.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like some exploding nebula
of madness.

34:08.513 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought it was just mildly
deranged, just
the epitome of nonlinear
thinking.

34:14.319 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's put it that way.

34:15.887 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what strikes me is, we have
got to remember,
what is the guy actually doing?

34:20.558 --> 34:25.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And here we have an
administration where he's
making a lot of press
conferences, but, on

34:25.463 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the substantive picks, he
doesn't have a national
security adviser.

34:28.667 --> 34:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 691 confirmable
positions in the
White House.

34:33.271 --> 34:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration has not
even come
up with names and nominees for
631 out of

34:38.576 --> 34:40.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those 691.

34:40.345 --> 34:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is nobody there, nobody
in the shop,
no policy-making being made.

34:45.650 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I compare it to, so, you
know, Trump
is sitting on the control deck
of the starship

34:50.255 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enterprise, and he can push a
lot of pretty
buttons, but those buttons
aren't connected

34:54.326 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to anything.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so nothing is happening.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, what's
getting the
attention, though -- David may
be right, but

35:00.832 --> 35:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is getting the attention is
what the
president was saying this week,
and this very

35:05.537 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public departure of his national
security
adviser, one of the -- any
president's closest

35:11.343 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
advisers, Michael Flynn.

35:13.278 --> 35:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And certainly one
of this president's
closest and most loyal
supporters, I mean,

35:18.917 --> 35:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spoke at the confirmation and
was in consideration
for vice president.

35:22.988 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this wasn't just a late
connection.

35:26.491 --> 35:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the irony to me, Judy, was
that Michael
Flynn, the reason for his
leaving wasn't that

35:35.066 --> 35:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had misled the vice president
about his
conversations with the Soviet --
the Russian

35:42.340 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador -- excuse me -- about
sanctions
or possibly sanctions and
retaliation, but

35:47.212 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that the president knew
about it,
had been informed about it, and
Mike Pence,

35:53.385 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vice president, only learned
about being
dissembled to, if one can be
dissembled to,

35:59.224 --> 36:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the national security adviser
through the
free press.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it wasn't the act itself.

36:05.597 --> 36:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the public exposure of
the act.

36:09.534 --> 36:10.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it was bizarre.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't have a successor.

36:13.405 --> 36:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think, more than
anything else,
what we're seeing in this
administration,

36:17.308 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Judy, is campaigns are fun.

36:21.112 --> 36:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaigns are police escorts,
they're airplanes,
they're crowds, they're
balloons, they're

36:25.316 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bands, a lot of fun.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You speak in vague generalities.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You get applause for slogans.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then governing comes.

36:34.392 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And governing is tedious and
it's difficult
an it's time-consuming and it
demands your

36:39.597 --> 36:40.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And policy isn't vague
generalities.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's specifics and it's based on
knowledge.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I will say this.

36:47.705 --> 36:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This White House is preciously
scarce on attention.

36:53.945 --> 36:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just don't think the
president -- I
think the president at that
press conference

36:57.749 --> 37:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you talked about really returned
to the campaign
station.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wants to do it again
Saturday.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's back to the balloons and
the bands and
the cheers.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's fun.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meanwhile,
David ,there
all these -- this controversy
swirl around.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What, are there are seven or
eight different
investigations going on about
whether there

37:13.798 --> 37:20.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a connection between the
Trump campaign
and Russia, looking at whether
it was campaign

37:20.071 --> 37:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials, whether it was
Michael Flynn's
talking to the ambassador?

37:22.974 --> 37:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there are some very real
concerns
out there that are hanging over
this administration.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, there are
three Russia
scandals all at once.

37:31.116 --> 37:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to me, the most significant
is the contacts
the administration -- or Trump
campaign may

37:35.353 --> 37:38.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have had with Russian
intelligence during
the campaign.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we know they did have
contacts.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know the content of
those contacts.

37:42.093 --> 37:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is collaboration, if
there is some
sort of quotation suggesting
they got tipped

37:46.397 --> 37:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off about some of the leaks or
something else,
that would be a cataclysmic
scandal, and it

37:51.336 --> 37:54.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would just rock the whole
administration.

37:54.038 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My instinct from talking to
people in the
intelligence community is that
there probably

37:57.876 --> 38:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no great quote showing Paul
Manafort getting
a specific tipoff from the
Russians, because

38:03.515 --> 38:05.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would already have had it by
now.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are so many intelligence
officials to
my newspaper and The Washington
Post, they

38:08.887 --> 38:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
probably would have leaked it.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have any inside New York
Times information
about that.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that would be just a
momentous scandal.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is just like -- that
was four days
ago, and we have almost
forgotten it.

38:18.062 --> 38:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a whole series of
scandals ratcheting
it up on the administration.

38:20.932 --> 38:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it possible,
Mark, the press,
all of us are making too much of
all this

38:25.069 --> 38:26.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russia concern?

38:26.905 --> 38:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It is, Judy, but
the only two
entities and news sources that
deny Russia's

38:33.144 --> 38:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involvement and malicious
involvement in the
election of a United States
president and

38:38.583 --> 38:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attempt to influence the outcome
appear to
be Vladimir Putin's Russia and
Donald Trump,

38:44.923 --> 38:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who calls this a Russian ruse.

38:46.424 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I don't have inside
information on what
went on.

38:52.897 --> 39:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was -- there is enough
at this point
that I think it puts the
Republicans in Congress

39:02.140 --> 39:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a terribly defensive crouch.

39:04.042 --> 39:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, you
started out with
some pretty strong language
describing the

39:09.080 --> 39:10.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news conference.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I wrote down.

39:11.649 --> 39:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you said he came across --
the president
came across as mildly deranged.

39:14.986 --> 39:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did you really mean that?

39:15.987 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I will walk that
back a little.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Unmoored.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that walking it back?

39:20.491 --> 39:21.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:23.361 --> 39:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It was -- if we
were not -- it's
just he's not coherently
speaking as a president

39:27.432 --> 39:31.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should who's going to be
carefully giving
orders, who's going to be
uniting the American

39:31.202 --> 39:32.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

39:33.004 --> 39:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is speaking as someone who's
involved in
a junior high school
gladiatorial attack on

39:36.941 --> 39:38.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And parts were bizarre and
somewhat offensive,
picking on an African-American
reporter and

39:41.579 --> 39:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assuming she knew people in the
Congressional
Black Caucus, because I guess
all African-American

39:45.516 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are supposed to know each
other.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's offensive.

39:48.853 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the attack on the
press, highlighted
by the tweets today saying that
my newspaper,

39:54.192 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NBC, all these organizations are
enemies of
the people.

39:57.095 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if you want to draw
rhetoric straight
out of the fascist playbook,
we're enemies

40:02.200 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the vote, the people, that is
like -- that
has so many historical echoes.

40:08.106 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's illiberal and offensive to
the way democracy
is supposed to work and how one
is supposed

40:14.712 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to just act within the
institutions of democracy.

40:16.981 --> 40:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, within that context, I think
some strong
language, to me, is merited.

40:20.952 --> 40:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, Donald
Trump was
critical of the press throughout
the campaign,

40:27.125 --> 40:28.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and he won.

40:28.993 --> 40:32.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the American people -- and
we heard William
Brangham talking to voters in
Texas who have

40:32.397 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely different views of
which parts
of the news media they listen
to.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could this be a winning strategy
on the president's
part?

40:41.773 --> 40:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think so,
Judy.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He ran against Hillary Clinton.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He ran -- that was his opponent.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the tough thing about a
campaign being
over is, you lose your enemy.

40:52.917 --> 40:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Barack Obama, at this
point in his
presidency in 2009 was on his
way already

40:59.457 --> 41:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to having passed the bailout,
the economic
bailout.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He passed the equal pay.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was on the way to health
care.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the time you build
coalitions.

41:10.401 --> 41:18.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is spending his
time, his energy,
precious time, really, and just
creating these

41:18.476 --> 41:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new enemies or trying to look
for a villain
like Hillary Clinton was that he
could run

41:24.148 --> 41:25.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
against.

41:25.316 --> 41:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He just -- he needs that as an
organizing
principle.

41:29.053 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without an organizing principle
of an enemy,
the press is a punching bag,
it's unpopular,

41:34.926 --> 41:36.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yes.

41:36.227 --> 41:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't approach the sense of
villainy
that he's looking for.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just don't think it will
wash long-term
as a political strategy.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, do you
think that's
what he's doing?

41:48.773 --> 41:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And do you agree with Mark, it's
not going
to work in the long run?

41:51.242 --> 41:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think it
offends 65
percent or 70 percent of the
American people,

41:55.346 --> 42:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, as we just saw from Texas,
it pleases
35 percent of the people.

42:00.485 --> 42:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he can hang along
with that
35 percent of the people for a
good long time.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been asking around
Republicans
on the Hill, are they worried?

42:07.825 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, personally, they are
worried, but there
will be no distance between
Republicans on

42:11.429 --> 42:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Hill and Donald Trump any
time soon.

42:13.598 --> 42:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among Republicans, according to
a Pew poll,
82 percent of Republicans right
now support

42:17.835 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, which is higher
than supported
Ronald Reagan at this time in
his administration.

42:22.607 --> 42:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Republicans like the guy;
35 percent
of Americans see this and they
say, yes, way

42:28.112 --> 42:29.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

42:29.113 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it will not be a majority
coalition.

42:30.882 --> 42:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will not be a governing
coalition, but
he will retain, if he continues
it this way,

42:36.287 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some solid base of support.

42:37.789 --> 42:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Let me disagree
just a little
with David.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Republicans have going
against them is
history.

42:43.494 --> 42:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, when a president, a
sitting president,
has his job rating in the Gallup
poll, his

42:48.332 --> 42:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approval rating, drop below 50
percent, that
president's party loses an
average of 37 seats

42:55.573 --> 42:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the House of Representatives
in the next
midterm election.

42:58.476 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When a president is above 50
percent, they
lose an average of 14 seats.

43:01.879 --> 43:03.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

43:03.681 --> 43:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the end of this year, the 1st
of January,
Republicans are going to be
looking, Donald

43:06.184 --> 43:07.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump is 35.

43:07.351 --> 43:08.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is his honeymoon.

43:08.553 --> 43:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new Gallup poll
has him in
the mid-30s.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Gallup poll has it
at 38.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's at that point now.

43:15.393 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's hard to see how he goes
higher without
some international crisis that
galvanized

43:20.131 --> 43:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
totally, national unanimity.

43:22.533 --> 43:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, January, his window of
opportunity to
pass something big -- and these
are difficult,

43:30.308 --> 43:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tricky, complicated issues he's
trying to
write legislation for -- is
between now and

43:36.113 --> 43:37.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
December.

43:37.882 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the 1st of January, members
of the party
on the Hill start thinking about
themselves

43:40.485 --> 43:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they have to establish
independence from
an unpopular person in the White
House.

43:44.188 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got to think about
getting reelected.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ten seconds,
David.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like the clock is
ticking.

43:50.895 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but they're
living in a
hermetically sealed Republican
universe, just

43:53.831 --> 43:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as Democrats are.

43:55.733 --> 43:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're responding to
their own universe,
even if it leads to electoral
downfall, as

43:58.369 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mark suggests.

43:59.370 --> 44:01.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

44:01.572 --> 44:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.

44:02.540 --> 44:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

44:12.683 --> 44:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally: An
actor at the
heart of the Oscars-so-white
controversy takes

44:23.327 --> 44:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a new role based on a true
story set in
colonial Africa.

44:27.565 --> 44:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story from
Los Angeles.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our occasional
series Beyond
the Red Carpet.

44:32.770 --> 44:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO, Actor: I'm not
asking for an
answer this very second.

44:39.310 --> 44:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I ask of you is that you go
away and think
about it.

44:45.249 --> 44:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 1947 London,
Seretse Khama,
played by David Oyelowo,
proposes to Ruth

44:51.556 --> 44:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Williams, played by actress
Rosamund Pike.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSAMUND PIKE, Actress: I know
what you're
asking.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:57.528 --> 44:58.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:58.696 --> 44:59.830 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:59.864 --> 45:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Their races make
the relationship
fraught.

45:04.635 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's more: He is a prince
in his tribe
in Southern Africa expected to
return to lead

45:09.974 --> 45:14.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his people, and their marriage
will have international
consequences.

45:14.045 --> 45:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A United Kingdom" is based on a
true story,
and it was Oyelowo who first
learned of it

45:19.817 --> 45:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a book titled "Color Bar" by
Susan Williams.

45:23.554 --> 45:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than just the film's star,
he was the
producer who brought director
Amma Asante

45:27.992 --> 45:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and others into the project.

45:29.794 --> 45:34.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID OYELOWO: What was
indisputable to me
was the power of the love
between these two

45:34.498 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and it was that very
thing that helped
them overcome so many of these
insurmountable

45:40.972 --> 45:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obstacles and odds that they
faced.

45:43.374 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, as someone who is
a real believer
in love myself, and I mean, love
in the truest

45:50.014 --> 45:52.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sense, not movie love.

45:52.483 --> 45:57.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm talking about the
unglamorous stuff of
sacrifice, of courage.

45:57.622 --> 46:02.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I must say this
film has movie
love, because it's love at first
sight almost,

46:02.360 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

46:04.161 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: But, you see, the
thing about
that is that we even have a name
for it, the

46:07.531 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meet-cute.

46:09.300 --> 46:15.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we have turned it into
something
that is so fantastical and so
inaccessible

46:15.206 --> 46:17.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it has become fairy
tale-like.

46:17.041 --> 46:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, actually, what can happen
-- it doesn't
happen every day, admittedly --
is that two

46:21.612 --> 46:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people see beyond their race,
see beyond their
cultural differences and their
national differences.

46:30.521 --> 46:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they just -- two souls meet.

46:34.358 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We should be fighting for
equality.

46:36.761 --> 46:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is where we should be
focusing our minds,
not on the wife I have chosen,
who means you

46:43.167 --> 46:45.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
no harm.

46:45.136 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The historical
characters,
Khama and Williams, become
caught up in colonial-era

46:49.306 --> 46:54.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics, as Britain tries to
hold onto the
land that will later become
Botswana, while

46:54.145 --> 46:58.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maintaining close ties to the
neighboring
apartheid regime of South
Africa.

46:58.482 --> 47:03.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID OYELOWO: It is
unacceptable that they
use their power to keep us
voiceless.

47:03.888 --> 47:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oyelowo is best
known for his
portrayal of another historical
figure, Martin

47:09.126 --> 47:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Luther King in the film "Selma."

47:14.598 --> 47:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he starred in a recent film
based on a
true story set in a slum in
Uganda, the "Queen

47:19.704 --> 47:21.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Katwe."

47:21.572 --> 47:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born in England, Oyelowo spent
ages 6 through
13 in Nigeria, before returning
and eventually

47:27.311 --> 47:30.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becoming a classically trained
stage actor.

47:30.181 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the first black actor to
play an English
king for the Royal Shakespeare
Company.

47:34.885 --> 47:39.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He recently returned to
Shakespeare, this
time on Broadway, in "Othello."

47:39.123 --> 47:41.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked what made him want to
take on a role.

47:41.559 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: It's got to
resonate for me,
but, also, I want to make things
that are

47:45.196 --> 47:50.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
synonymous with who I am as a
man and how
I'm bringing up my children, you
know, what

47:50.468 --> 47:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is I believe in, because this
is a very
powerful medium, culturally,
politically,

47:58.809 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
familially.

48:00.211 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can shape people's thoughts.

48:02.780 --> 48:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I think of this
film and I
think of "Selma" and "Queen of
Katwe," right,

48:08.552 --> 48:13.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly films that have a kind
of larger context
to them, right, a history.

48:13.858 --> 48:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: Yes, I think that
is also a
key and is crucial to me.

48:18.529 --> 48:21.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You used the word context there.

48:21.298 --> 48:25.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something that is very important
to me is
contextualizing what it is to be
someone who

48:25.870 --> 48:27.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looks like me on planet Earth.

48:27.705 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And by that, I mean a black man.

48:30.141 --> 48:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have lived on three
continents as a
black man, and there are
differences.

48:35.579 --> 48:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are complexities and
dimensions to being
someone like me in all of those
places that

48:45.689 --> 48:49.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are rarely, in my opinion, seen
on film and
television.

48:49.894 --> 48:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To the extent
that you don't
see you that much in the film
world, that

48:55.800 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has limited the roles that you
can get?

48:58.502 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: It hasn't because
I have chosen
to do something about it.

49:03.207 --> 49:10.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I produced "A United
Kingdom," and
I'm pretty sure that's probably
the only way

49:10.080 --> 49:12.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this film would have got made.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do it yourself.

49:14.351 --> 49:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: Yes, do it
yourself, and because
I'm very passionate about seeing
a story like

49:19.690 --> 49:21.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this told.

49:21.592 --> 49:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And passion is what makes you
roll up your
sleeves and get it done.

49:25.229 --> 49:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And passion, I think, can be
contagious.

49:27.198 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I read that,
early on, you
asked your agent to go after
roles that might

49:32.002 --> 49:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been written for white
actors, to put
your for them.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID OYELOWO: Yes.

49:38.142 --> 49:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, like the producing, it
was born out
of necessity.

49:41.178 --> 49:47.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I looked at my white
contemporaries or
the white actors ahead of me, as
a young actor

49:47.484 --> 49:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back then, there was complexity
that made
me see myself in them, even
though they were

49:54.491 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white people living a very
different life
to mine.

49:58.162 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was able to identify with what
they were
going through emotionally.

50:02.366 --> 50:07.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I couldn't identify
necessarily with what
black characters I saw in films
and TV were

50:07.571 --> 50:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going through, because it was
one-dimensional,
at best two-dimensional.

50:12.776 --> 50:18.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oyelowo was
directly caught
up in the 2015 Oscars-so-white
controversy

50:18.983 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when his critically-acclaimed
performance
in "Selma" failed to receive an
Oscar nomination,

50:24.088 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and neither did any other actor
of color.

50:26.357 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said in an interview,
"There's resistance
to films with black
protagonists, especially

50:31.028 --> 50:33.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they can't have Denzel
Washington in the
lead role."

50:33.731 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID OYELOWO: Right.

50:35.499 --> 50:41.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That must be qualified with me
saying, he
is one of my heroes, and I will
go anywhere

50:41.338 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to see him.

50:42.339 --> 50:43.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:43.340 --> 50:44.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As would I.

50:44.341 --> 50:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not to denigrate him.

50:45.342 --> 50:46.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a great actor.

50:46.343 --> 50:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: Absolutely.

50:48.178 --> 50:56.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, there is a reason why
there's isn't
a plethora of other black actors
that you

50:56.854 --> 51:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could reel off the tip of your
tongue who
-- in that space that he
occupies, which is

51:04.728 --> 51:08.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he can play anything.

51:08.299 --> 51:16.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's not tied to race as the
prerequisite
for why he gets to be the
protagonist in a

51:16.240 --> 51:17.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
film.

51:17.975 --> 51:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the resistance is -- I think
is purely
to do with the decision-makers,
you know?

51:22.980 --> 51:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to see themselves in
movies, as
we all do.

51:28.452 --> 51:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you see in movies is
a reflection
of those who are making the
decision.

51:33.791 --> 51:38.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But for you,
personally, your
producer role becomes almost as
important,

51:38.128 --> 51:39.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
perhaps, as your acting role.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID OYELOWO: Yes, crucial, in
a sense.

51:42.199 --> 51:47.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, you can either
complain about this
stuff, or you can do what you
can to change

51:47.838 --> 51:48.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

51:48.839 --> 51:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the tack I have
chosen.

51:50.674 --> 51:56.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Oyelowo,
producer and
actor, stars in the new film "A
United Kingdom"

51:56.146 --> 51:58.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just out in theaters nationwide.

51:58.816 --> 52:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Los Angeles, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

52:10.861 --> 52:20.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: The director of an
Oscar-nominated documentary

52:20.537 --> 52:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walks us through his favorite
scene of best
picture nominee "Moonlight."

52:25.342 --> 52:28.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's ahead of the Academy
Awards ceremony
next weekend.

52:28.912 --> 52:33.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:33.584 --> 52:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tonight on PBS' "Washington
Week": less
than a month after taking
office, President

52:38.789 --> 52:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump facing new questions about
his administration's
relationship with Russia -- a
deep dive into

52:44.161 --> 52:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's pushback at
leaks and the
consequences of alternative
facts, later tonight
