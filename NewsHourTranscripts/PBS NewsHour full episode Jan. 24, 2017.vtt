JOHN YANG: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.475 --> 00:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: While
President
Trump signs another flurry of
executive actions,

00:13.547 --> 00:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate grills his picks to
run the nation's
budget and health care.

00:17.818 --> 00:23.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: life after the presidency,
a look at
the second acts of ex-presidents
after leaving

00:23.390 --> 00:25.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the highest office.

00:25.225 --> 00:30.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jeffrey Brown sits down with
the director
of "La La Land" to talk how the
unconventional

00:31.031 --> 00:34.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musical is ushering the past
into the modern
age.

00:34.434 --> 00:38.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE, Director, "La
La Land": If
you want to actually help an art
form, or

00:38.305 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of contribute to it in some
ways, you
have to find a way to add
something new.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to update it.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:46.513 --> 00:50.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.918 --> 01:03.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another busy day at
the Trump White
House today, with the new
president undoing

01:03.096 --> 01:05.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of the Obama legacy.

01:05.365 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, the focus was on
hotly debated
plans for moving oil across the
country.

01:10.003 --> 01:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We will see if we can
get that pipeline

01:14.508 --> 01:16.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
built.

01:16.376 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With the stroke of a
pen, President
Trump breathed new life into two
major pipeline

01:20.480 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projects: the Keystone XL,
running from Alberta,
Canada, to Nebraska, which
then-President

01:26.420 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama halted in late 2015, and
the Dakota
Access pipeline, for which the
Army Corps

01:31.925 --> 01:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Engineers decided last year
to explore
alternate routes across North
Dakota.

01:38.065 --> 01:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Keystone, Mr. Trump directed
the State
Department to rule on a new
application for

01:42.302 --> 01:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1,100-mile pipeline within
60 days after
it's submitted.

01:48.241 --> 01:56.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A lot of jobs,
28,000 jobs,
great construction jobs.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OK, Keystone pipeline.

01:58.418 --> 02:02.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Dakota pipeline
has triggered
protests from the Standing Rock
Sioux Tribe

02:02.756 --> 02:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others, who say it endangers
cultural
sites and drinking water.

02:06.827 --> 02:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump ordered that all new
pipelines be
constructed with U.S.-made
steel.

02:11.932 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also moved today
to speed up
the environmental review process
for infrastructure

02:16.803 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
projects, as well as the
permitting process
for manufacturers.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Sometimes, it
takes many, many
years, and we don't want that to
happen.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it's a no, we will give
them a quick
no.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it's a yes, it's like,
let's start
building.

02:30.550 --> 02:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cutting red tape was
a topic at
a breakfast meeting with auto
executives.

02:34.955 --> 02:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's out of
control, and we're
going to make it a very short
process.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to either give
you your permits
or we're not going to give you
your permits.

02:43.463 --> 02:44.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you're going to know very
quickly.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That drew praise from
GM CEO Mary
Barra.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY BARRA, CEO, General Motors:
There is
a huge opportunity, you know,
working together

02:50.470 --> 02:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an industry with government,
that we can
do and improve the environment,
improve safety

02:55.942 --> 02:59.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and improve the jobs creation
and the competitiveness
of manufacturing.

02:59.646 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, Mr. Trump
had news on
making a nomination to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

03:04.251 --> 03:08.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will be making
my decision
this week.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will be announcing next week.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, he huddled
with Senate leaders
to discuss the year-old court
vacancy.

03:14.928 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also sat down with Mike
Pompeo, the newly
confirmed CIA director.

03:19.132 --> 03:24.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were reports that he's
asking James
Comey to stay on as FBI
director.

03:24.304 --> 03:29.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer wouldn't
confirm that, but he did discuss
the president's

03:29.409 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belief, which he repeated to
congressional
leaders on Monday, that Hillary
Clinton won

03:33.980 --> 03:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the popular vote because of
ballot fraud.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The president does believe that.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's stated that before.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he stated his
concerns of voter
fraud and people voting
illegally during the

03:44.191 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he continues to maintain
that belief,
based on studies and evidence
that people

03:48.628 --> 03:50.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have presented to him.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Election officials
across the country
say there is no evidence to
support the claim.

03:54.568 --> 04:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Trump will
address a
joint session of Congress on
February 28.

04:00.774 --> 04:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Capitol Hill, four more of
Mr. Trump's
Cabinet-level nominees advanced.

04:05.045 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee approved Dr. Ben
Carson to be secretary
of housing and urban
development, billionaire

04:10.350 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investor Wilbur Ross to be
commerce secretary,
South Carolina Governor Nikki
Haley to be

04:15.856 --> 04:20.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ambassador to the United
Nations, and for
secretary of transportation,
Elaine Chao,

04:20.794 --> 04:22.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a former labor secretary.

04:22.462 --> 04:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late this afternoon, the full
Senate confirmed
Ambassador Haley.

04:26.700 --> 04:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's nominee to run the
Small Business
Administration says her
experience building

04:31.771 --> 04:37.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World Wrestling Entertainment,
or the WWE,
is just what's needed for the
job.

04:37.978 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Linda McMahon also told her
confirmation hearing
today that she and her husband
once lost their

04:43.049 --> 04:47.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home to bankruptcy, and she
said, "I know
what it's like to take a hit."

04:47.921 --> 04:52.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister Theresa
May will have
to get Parliament's approval
before she starts

04:52.192 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the process of withdrawing from
the European
Union.

04:55.162 --> 04:60.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Kingdom's Supreme
Court ruled today
that May doesn't have the
authority to do

05:00.033 --> 05:01.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it on her own.

05:01.835 --> 05:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, the government told
the House
of Commons it will rush
legislation to approve

05:06.239 --> 05:08.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the beginning the Brexit
process.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: That is what the British
people voted
for, and it is what they would
expect.

05:12.445 --> 05:17.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Parliament will rightly
scrutinize and debate
this legislation, but I trust no
one will

05:17.884 --> 05:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seek to make it a vehicle for
attempts to
thwart the will of the people,
or frustrate

05:22.022 --> 05:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or delay the process of leaving
the European
Union.

05:25.225 --> 05:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lawmakers will have a
chance to
offer amendments to that
legislation and on

05:29.863 --> 05:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worker rights and other issues,
and that could
delay Brexit.

05:34.267 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Israeli government has
announced plans
to build 2,500 more homes in
Jewish settlements

05:38.805 --> 05:40.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the West Bank.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the second such move since
President
Trump took office.

05:43.210 --> 05:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has indicated he will be much
more receptive
to settlement expansion than
President Obama

05:47.747 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel says the new homes will
be in existing
settlements that they would
retain in any

05:52.419 --> 05:53.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
peace deal with the
Palestinians.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A Palestinian spokesman
condemned the announcement.

05:57.390 --> 06:03.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, Turkey and Iran pledged
today to shore
up a fragile cease-fire between
the Syrian

06:03.263 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regime and rebel groups.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The announcement came at the
conclusion of
peace talks hosted in Kazakstan.

06:09.469 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opposition quickly objected
to Iran's
involvement because of its
battlefield support

06:14.040 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Syria 's government, but the
U.N. envoy
called for restraint.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: We cannot allow
another cease-fire,

06:20.880 --> 06:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a third one, to be, in a way,
wasted because
of a lack of a political
process.

06:28.521 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now is the time for the
international
community, in all its
dimensions, to come

06:33.059 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
together and support one
integrated political
negotiating process, based also
on the help

06:39.766 --> 06:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this remarkable moment that
we had today.

06:42.769 --> 06:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The United States did
not take
part in the parts.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Central Italy, search teams
found 10 more
bodies in a hotel wrecked by an
avalanche

06:51.778 --> 06:53.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That brings to 17 the number
killed when the
wall of snow smashed into the
site.

06:57.984 --> 07:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rescue crews have been working
for days to
try to find more survivors.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nine people have been found
alive so far.

07:04.858 --> 07:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A dozen are still unaccounted
for.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, bank
stocks helped fuel
a rally that set new records.

07:12.866 --> 07:19.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
113 points to close at 19912.

07:19.272 --> 07:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 48 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added almost 15.

07:24.744 --> 07:28.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P closed at
all-time
highs.

07:28.715 --> 07:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Oscar nominations are
out, and "La
La Land" got a record-tying 14.

07:33.787 --> 07:39.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The romantic musical will
contend with eight
other films for best picture,
including "Hidden

07:39.459 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Figures," "Manchester by the
Sea" and "Fences."

07:43.096 --> 07:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, this year's nominees
are much more
diverse, with seven actors of
color out of

07:48.034 --> 07:49.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a total of 20.

07:49.703 --> 07:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have an interview with
the director
of "La La Land" later in the
program.

07:54.374 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two presidential
nominees get grilled by
senators; a shifting

07:59.646 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. environmental policy,
starting with the
Keystone and Dakota oil
pipelines; life after

08:06.453 --> 08:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Oval Office, what presidents
do when they
leave the White House; and much
more.

08:16.596 --> 08:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Capitol Hill today, it was
another marathon
round of confirmation hearings
for President

08:27.040 --> 08:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's Cabinet nominees.

08:28.808 --> 08:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His pick to head the Department
of Health
and Human Services, Georgia
Congressman Tom

08:33.380 --> 08:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Price, took his turn before the
Senate Finance
Committee.

08:37.183 --> 08:42.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just like last week, the
physician lawmaker
faced tough questioning on what
is going to

08:42.322 --> 08:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen as the administration
moves to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, Mr. Trump signed an
executive order
allowing the administration to
delay, waive

08:51.698 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or change parts of the law that
are too much
of a burden.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senators wanted to know what
that means, starting
with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: Will you
guarantee
that no one will lose coverage
under the executive

09:06.513 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order?

09:07.514 --> 09:09.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE (R-GA), Health and
Human Services
Secretary Nominee: I guarantee
you that the

09:11.251 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals that lost coverage
under the Affordable
Care Act, we will commit to
making certain

09:13.286 --> 09:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they don't lose coverage
under whatever
replacement plan comes forward.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the commitment that I
provide to you.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:20.126 --> 09:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN: The question again
is, will anyone
lose coverage?

09:23.763 --> 09:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you answered to something I
didn't ask.

09:27.133 --> 09:33.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Will you commit to not
implementing the order
until the replacement plan is in
place?

09:33.973 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE: What I commit to the
American people
is to keep patients at the
center of health

09:39.145 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that means to me is
making certain
that every single American has
access to affordable

09:44.617 --> 09:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health coverage that will
provide the highest-quality
health care that the world can
provide.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:50.590 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON WYDEN: I'm going to close by
way of saying
that what the congressman is
saying is that

09:56.029 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the order could go into effect
before there
is a replacement plan.

10:00.767 --> 10:07.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And independent experts say that
this is going
to destroy the market on which
millions of

10:07.740 --> 10:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working families buy health
coverage.

10:11.478 --> 10:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the questions that I ask,
will the
congressman commit that nobody
will be worse

10:17.383 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off, nobody will lose coverage,
we didn't
get an answer.

10:22.088 --> 10:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senators also tried
find out what
role Price was playing in
crafting the president's

10:26.993 --> 10:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care alternative, but
didn't have much
success.

10:30.530 --> 10:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not far from Price's hearing,
the Senate Budget
Committee grilled the
president's pick to

10:34.100 --> 10:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
head the Office of Management
and Budget.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has that story.

10:38.638 --> 10:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Congressman
Mick Mulvaney
was introduced at this morning's
hearing as

10:43.309 --> 10:45.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a vigilant budget hawk.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The staunch conservative is
President Trump's
choice to lead the White House
Budget Office.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY (R-SC), Budget
Director Nominee:
I believe, as a matter of
principle, that

10:52.819 --> 10:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the debt is a problem that must
be addressed
sooner rather than later.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also know that fundamental
changes are necessary
in the way Washington spends and
taxes if

10:57.957 --> 10:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we truly want a healthy economy.

10:59.759 --> 11:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mulvaney was
elected as a
South Carolina representative in
2010 in the

11:04.197 --> 11:06.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tea Party wave.

11:06.065 --> 11:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told senators today that
Medicare, Medicaid
and Social Security need
significant changes

11:12.472 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be preserved for the future.

11:14.307 --> 11:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mr. Trump used different
words when he
spoke to the conservative news
site The Daily

11:19.345 --> 11:21.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Signal in May of 2015.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: I'm not going to cut
Social Security,

11:23.850 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like every other Republican, and
I'm not going
to cut Medicare or Medicaid.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders
pressed Mulvaney on the
contrast.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Will you tell
the president of the United
States, Mr. President,

11:34.694 --> 11:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep your word, be honest with
the American
people, do not cut Social
Security, Medicare

11:39.966 --> 11:40.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Medicaid?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: The only thing I
know to do
is to tell the president the
truth.

11:44.437 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is that, if we do
not reform
these programs that are so
important to your

11:49.676 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constituents in Vermont, and to
mine in South
Carolina, I believe in nine or
10 years, the

11:54.547 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Medicaid trust fund is empty.

11:56.583 --> 12:00.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In roughly in 17 or 18 years,
the Social Security
trust fund is empty.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
sustainability of Social
Security also came up in an
exchange between

12:05.391 --> 12:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mulvaney and fellow South
Carolinian Lindsey
Graham.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Would
you agree with me that, for
younger workers,

12:11.631 --> 12:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they may have to work longer
before they enter
the program, to save the
program?

12:14.934 --> 12:16.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: I have already
told my children
to prepare for exactly that.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mulvaney said
he doesn't
want to cut entitlements for
people already

12:21.441 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
receiving benefits.

12:23.376 --> 12:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said he agrees with
President Trump's
plan to boost the Pentagon's
budget.

12:27.914 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That issue and Mulvaney's record
on the military
came up during his second
hearing this afternoon,

12:33.553 --> 12:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the Senate Homeland
Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: What's
the highest
priority, reducing the debt or
rebuilding

12:40.893 --> 12:41.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the military?

12:41.894 --> 12:43.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: The number one
priority of
the United States government is
to defend

12:44.364 --> 12:45.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nation.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN: That's nice to hear
that you
believe they're important,
because you have

12:50.937 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent your entire congressional
career pitting
the debt against our military,
and each time,

12:55.174 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least for you, our military
was less important.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The nominee was
also forced
to answer for his failure years
ago to pay

13:02.949 --> 13:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than $15,000 in payroll
taxes for a household
worker.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mulvaney said it was a mistake.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: It was a young
woman who did
not live with us, did not teach
the children,

13:13.259 --> 13:16.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
did not cook or clean.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She helped my wife with the
children.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we did not withhold federal
taxes.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, honestly, I didn't think
about it again
until December.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was my responsibility.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once it was brought to my
attention, I
did the only thing I know to do,
which is

13:29.008 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply be straightforward about
it, admit
the problem and then try to fix
it.

13:32.979 --> 13:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some Democrats
have said
that error is disqualifying.

13:37.283 --> 13:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And nominees have confronted
similar issues
in the past.

13:40.420 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of President Clinton's picks
for attorney
general, Kimba Wood and Zoe
Baird, withdrew

13:45.825 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a failure to pay taxes on
household help.

13:49.529 --> 13:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That led to revelations that two
already confirmed
secretaries, Ron Brown and
Federico Pena,

13:55.702 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had also failed to pay employee
taxes.

13:59.105 --> 14:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2009, tax concerns sank
Tom Daschle,
President Obama's choice for the
Health and

14:05.278 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Human Services Department.

14:07.346 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Tim Geithner was confirmed
as treasury
secretary that year, despite not
paying all

14:12.819 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his personal taxes.

14:15.388 --> 14:19.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mulvaney was also pressed on
the 2013
government shutdown.

14:19.158 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of the conservatives
who said it
was worth not compromising and
allowing the

14:24.230 --> 14:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showdown to make their point
about the Affordable
Care Act, which he wanted to
repeal.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing, though, Republicans
say, despite
all of the pressing from
Democrats, they think

14:33.740 --> 14:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of these nominees will
ultimately be confirmed,
John, even as we see some of the
votes continue

14:38.878 --> 14:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be postponed in hearings.

14:40.546 --> 14:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John, it's really a question of
Republicans,
they say, of not if, but when.

14:45.084 --> 14:49.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, one big
nomination that President
Trump says he is going to make
next week is

14:49.188 --> 14:50.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Supreme Court.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a meeting at the White
House with
Senate leaders to talk about it.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you hearing about that
meeting?

14:54.694 --> 14:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're hearing it was a short
meeting.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have multiple sources,
Republican and Democrat,
telling me it lasted about 30
minutes.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From the Republican side, we get
one version.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Grassley sent out a
statement to us
saying that it was a step in the
right direction,

15:07.774 --> 15:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it was productive and
frank.

15:09.709 --> 15:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, John, Democrats say simply
that it was
a chance for them to state their
belief that

15:14.280 --> 15:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this Supreme Court nominee must
be from the
mainstream.

15:17.617 --> 15:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How I read that, both sides are
honestly gearing
for a potential very large
fight.

15:22.555 --> 15:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And talking to senators in the
hallway today,
John, you could tell Republicans
are brace

15:26.459 --> 15:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves for the possibility
that they may
not be able to get 60 votes,
which is the

15:31.297 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
requirement right now for a
Supreme Court
nominee.

15:34.333 --> 15:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they seem to be considering
a discussion
over changing that rule down to
50.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be a monumental
change, and it seems
like it might be ahead.

15:44.243 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, give us an
update on
what is also ahead on the big
Trump goal on

15:51.484 --> 15:55.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Hill, which is to repeal and
replace the
Affordable Care Act.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have some deadlines coming up
on that in
just a couple of days.

15:58.591 --> 16:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, that's the deadline
for committees
to put in their language
essentially for what

16:04.263 --> 16:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the repeal should look like.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the replacement.

16:07.834 --> 16:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The replacement, meanwhile, will
also be a
huge topic of conversation,
perhaps the biggest

16:11.404 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
topic of conversation, when
House and Senate
Republicans go to Philadelphia
starting tomorrow

16:16.909 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their retreat.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to be where they
lay out their
game plan for the entire year.

16:21.881 --> 16:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the very top of the
agenda, Republicans
will try to work out amongst
themselves how

16:26.919 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to deal with the
Obamacare replacement.

16:29.255 --> 16:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And another Trump
priority that
a lot of people thought the
Democrats on the

16:33.326 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hill might be able to work with
them on was
the infrastructure project.

16:37.463 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I understand that the
Democrats had something
to say about that today.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

16:42.902 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats agree, we also want to
expand American
infrastructure and do more on
it.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's where the agreement
ends.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats' proposal today is a
$1 trillion
infrastructure plan.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The difference, it seems, John
is potentially
how they would pay for it.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats say they would like to
close tax
loopholes.

16:58.651 --> 17:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're waiting to see what
President Trump
proposes, how large his
infrastructure plan

17:03.256 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But already Republicans say on
the Hill say
no way to the way Democrats are
going.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They instead want just a
straight spending
plan.

17:11.764 --> 17:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans want to have tax
credits that
would go more to businesses,
rather than just

17:16.135 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hiring for paving highways and
such.

17:18.504 --> 17:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they agree on one thing, that
America needs
more roads and bridges, but they
certainly

17:23.409 --> 17:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disagree on how to do it.

17:25.411 --> 17:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, the
Republicans complained
a lot about President Obama's
executive actions.

17:29.548 --> 17:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had a lot of executive
actions from
President Trump so far.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's been the reaction on the
Hill?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This has been
such an interesting
storyline today, John.

17:39.025 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the most part, Republicans
are of course
happy with some of these
executive actions,

17:42.795 --> 17:46.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things like the Keystone
pipeline in Canada.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that they have
pushed for
that.

17:48.467 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if you look at the details
of these executive
actions, specifically another
one on pipelines,

17:53.673 --> 17:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, President Trump asked the
Commerce
Department to come up with a
plan that would

17:57.743 --> 18:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ensure that pipelines all be
made from American-built
products, so American steel,
essentially.

18:04.684 --> 18:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something he talked about
in the campaign,
but it's something that House
Speaker Ryan

18:08.521 --> 18:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself took out of a bill
formally.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not all Republicans like that
idea.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not all sure it's good
for business.

18:14.093 --> 18:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins, just
outside the
House chamber, thank you very
much.

18:25.137 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we reported, President Trump
today signed
a number of executive orders,
some of them

18:34.380 --> 18:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
undoing part of President
Obama's environmental
legacy.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

18:40.019 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Two of those
moves gave
new life to two of the most
contentious oil

18:43.956 --> 18:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pipelines in America, the Dakota
Access pipeline,
which hundreds of Native
American groups have

18:48.461 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been protesting, as well as the
Keystone XL
pipeline.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both of these had been delayed
or put on hold
by the Obama administration.

18:56.302 --> 19:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To understand how these moves
fit into the
Trump administration's broader
plans for energy

19:00.740 --> 19:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and environmental policy, I'm
joined by Valerie
Volcovici.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She covers this for Reuters.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI, Reuters:
Thank you.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So let's talk
about these
two pipelines in particular.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dakota Access pipeline, what
did Trump's
order say about that?

19:14.320 --> 19:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: So, Trump's
order this
morning basically said that he
wants to expedite

19:19.358 --> 19:21.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the process.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you well know, the Dakota
Access protest
has really galvanized Native
American tribal

19:26.665 --> 19:28.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sovereignty issues.

19:28.567 --> 19:33.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's brought together So, wide
coalition of
environmentalists, social
activists, in addition

19:33.873 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to tribes.

19:35.541 --> 19:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's been one of the more
high-profile
protests that we have seen in a
while.

19:39.311 --> 19:44.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, it's kind of stalled
because former
President Obama ordered an
environmental review

19:44.950 --> 19:52.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a kind of contentious section
of this pipeline
that the tribe argues crosses
into some sacred

19:52.425 --> 19:53.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sites.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His aim is really to move it
along, because...

19:55.094 --> 19:56.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He wants to
get this built.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: He wants to
get it built,
and he said so on the campaign
trail, and

19:59.231 --> 20:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is following through on day
four, whatever
it is, of the administration.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, this one
really wasn't
that much of a surprise, if you
had been listening

20:05.971 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to him all along.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Right.

20:08.174 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then what
about the
Keystone XL?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is a slightly different
issue.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was another pipeline that
goes from Canada
down to the Gulf.

20:13.279 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was one that Obama for
many, many
years seemed to wrangle with and
debate what

20:17.850 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, and then eventually
denied the permit
for it.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did Trump do today?

20:22.621 --> 20:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Well, what
Trump did today
is, first of all, it invited
Canada to reapply.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TransCanada is the company that
wants to get
it built.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as I'm aware, TransCanada
has said
it wants to reapply.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it will have the State
Department.

20:36.202 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will do an environmental
impact assessment
of the permit and decide whether
or not to

20:42.007 --> 20:42.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
issue it.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it needs to be done within
60 days.

20:44.844 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, again, another sign that
Trump wants to
fast-track this, because, as we
remember from

20:50.149 --> 20:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Keystone fights, it lasted a
long time
and kind of became a symbol of
President Obama's

20:58.724 --> 21:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
environmental goals and it
really also galvanized
the environmentalists.

21:04.163 --> 21:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, these
orders don't guarantee
that they will go forward.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just seemed to move the
ball much closer
to the goalposts, right?

21:11.904 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Right, but
this will be
-- you know, everything will be
at the discretion

21:16.175 --> 21:19.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the various agencies
involved.

21:19.178 --> 21:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess one could assume
that they would
lean in favor, because now we
have a different

21:24.150 --> 21:25.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
administration in.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can also expect to see legal
challenges.

21:28.053 --> 21:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lawyer for the Standing Rock
Tribe said
that they're going to be
focusing on the legal

21:33.159 --> 21:34.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
battles.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are going to be in court.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump has said
all along that this is about
jobs primarily.

21:38.697 --> 21:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we have a sense of how many
jobs these
two pipelines would generate?

21:42.635 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: He said this
morning when
he was announcing these orders
that the Keystone

21:47.039 --> 21:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pipeline would create 28,000
jobs.

21:50.342 --> 21:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Previous assessments of the
pipeline said
that really the permanent jobs
created are

21:55.314 --> 21:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe a little more than a dozen
or two dozen
jobs.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Two dozen
jobs?

21:59.185 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Yes.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the numbers cited are always
in conflict.

22:03.889 --> 22:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are always very much
contested, when
you look at the permanent jobs
and the temporary

22:10.196 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that environmental
groups will
argue that, as far as these
pipelines being

22:15.134 --> 22:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job creators, in the long term,
not so much,
because the permanent jobs are
just much fewer

22:21.440 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than the temporary jobs.

22:23.742 --> 22:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we saw President Trump
yesterday met with
labor union representatives,
very strong proponents

22:30.416 --> 22:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of both these pipeline projects,
and they
were very, very happy after
their meeting

22:35.588 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with President Trump yesterday.

22:38.490 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the labor leaders
today said, you
know, we're really excited to
see, you know,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's not all talk, he's action.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they were very happy to see
it early on.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There were a
few other executive
orders that the president issued
today that

22:51.103 --> 22:52.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also pertained to this.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What were these about?

22:54.173 --> 22:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: So, these
orders were kind
of more generally talking about
the overall

22:59.111 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process of approving these
pipeline projects
and different infrastructure
projects.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, speeding
the process
along?

23:05.684 --> 23:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Speeding the
process.

23:07.453 --> 23:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a very interesting addition
is that a
pipeline project should use
American steel,

23:14.893 --> 23:16.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American labor.

23:16.762 --> 23:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, using some of Trump's
America-first energy
and broader policy, that's kind
of injected

23:21.767 --> 23:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into his approach to pipelines
and infrastructure.

23:24.403 --> 23:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More broadly,
I know you
have studied the Obama
administration's environmental

23:28.540 --> 23:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy and then the emerging
Trump administration's
policy.

23:32.211 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do these pipeline projects
fit into that
larger vision, as you see it?

23:37.583 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Well,
candidate Trump made
it very clear what he wants to
see.

23:42.521 --> 23:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has seen President Obama --
former President
Obama's environmental
regulations as something

23:48.994 --> 23:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's choking the U.S. economy,
that's preventing
jobs from being created.

23:54.700 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Obama didn't
really see that
they were an impediment to job
creation.

23:58.470 --> 24:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he liked to highlight that
U.S. emissions
went down as the economy grew.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Trump's vision is very
different.

24:07.413 --> 24:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sees an all-of-the-above
energy strategy,
with a very heavy focus on
fossil fuels.

24:13.052 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sees that as really a way to
create this
American renaissance in
manufacturing and

24:20.559 --> 24:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, you know, those good old
blue-collar jobs
that he was really talking about
very much

24:25.197 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the campaign trail.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, for him, it's part of his
economic vision.

24:29.568 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The environmental gains of the
Obama administration
were seen as an impediment to
those goals.

24:34.506 --> 24:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Valerie Volcovici
of Reuters, thank you very much.

24:39.545 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALERIE VOLCOVICI: Thank you.

24:46.819 --> 24:51.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

24:51.357 --> 24:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": do
more police
in schools improve safety or
make racial disparities

24:57.229 --> 25:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worse?; and the inspiration
behind the film
with the most Oscar nominations,
the musical

25:02.701 --> 25:05.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"La La Land."

25:05.537 --> 25:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: When former President
Obama lifted
off from the U.S. Capitol
Friday, he joined

25:10.309 --> 25:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the most exclusive clubs
in the world.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are just five living
ex-presidents.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, a former president can do
pretty much
whatever he wants.

25:19.885 --> 25:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a weekend in Palm Springs,
President
Obama and his wife reportedly
flew to the

25:26.058 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
British Virgin Islands for some
vacation time.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But what next?

25:30.996 --> 25:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff sat down with
Atlantic writer
Barbara Bradley Hagerty, who
spent several

25:35.667 --> 25:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months looking at how presidents
who left
office at relatively young ages
decided what

25:41.106 --> 25:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do with the rest of their
lives.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is part of the "NewsHour"'s
ongoing partnership
with "The Atlantic."

25:46.912 --> 25:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY, "The
Atlantic": Well,
generally, presidents -- and
let's refer throughout

25:50.983 --> 25:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history -- unless presidents
were wealthy,
they generally had to work.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, George Washington became the
largest whiskey
distiller.

25:58.457 --> 26:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, William Howard
Taft became
the Supreme Court chief justice.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, they had to work.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more recently, what I was
interested
in seeing is that presidents are
living so

26:09.735 --> 26:11.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long now.

26:11.537 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when a president leaves in
midlife, at
the peak of his game, what does
he do then?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does he do for an encore?

26:18.410 --> 26:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, over time,
the idea of
what to do and the amount of
time has changed.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Take us back to modern
presidents.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you looked at Jimmy
Carter.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Jimmy
Carter, he
had a rough landing after his
presidency,

26:33.759 --> 26:35.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is not atypical.

26:35.594 --> 26:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Jimmy Carter loses to -- in
a landslide
to Ronald Reagan, and he comes
home to Plains,

26:43.068 --> 26:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia, and there he finds that
his business,
his peanut business, is a
million dollars

26:47.372 --> 26:52.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in debt, that his house is in
need of repair,
and, literally, the forest has
come right

26:52.978 --> 26:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up to his back step, their back
step.

26:55.514 --> 26:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was kind of this metaphor
for Jimmy
Carter's life.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does he navigate through the
thicket?

27:01.253 --> 27:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does he have meaning in his
life, after
he was a one-term, relatively
unpopular president?

27:07.192 --> 27:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that was his challenge.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he was in his
mid-50s.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: He was.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was 56.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how did he go
about figuring
out what he would do?

27:15.133 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: When
you look at
Carter, what you saw was a man
who was -- his

27:19.171 --> 27:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personality, he was very smart,
very ambitious,
and he had a kind of biblical
ethos.

27:24.643 --> 27:29.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Walter Mondale told me
that Jimmy
Carter said, you know, when this
is all over,

27:29.248 --> 27:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to be a missionary.

27:31.016 --> 27:31.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So there's that.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then there was his
presidency.

27:34.219 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what you saw in the
presidency, it was
a rough presidency, but he had
this one defining

27:39.057 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
area, right, Camp David, peace
between Israel
and Egypt.

27:45.030 --> 27:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what he did is, he took
those two things
and he created the Carter
Center.

27:50.469 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Carter Center absolutely
redefined
the post-presidency for everyone
who came

27:55.140 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind him.

27:56.909 --> 28:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He created this institution
where he could
do freelance diplomacy and other
good works

28:02.447 --> 28:03.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

28:03.782 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Carter Center has
monitored more than
100 elections.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's won the Nobel Peace Prize.

28:10.122 --> 28:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also kind of got under -- he
was kind of
a burr under the saddle of his
successors.

28:15.661 --> 28:23.168 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Because of this
peace-at-any-cost type of
ethos, he ended up interfering
in their policies.

28:23.201 --> 28:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, under President
Clinton, North
Korea was developing nuclear
weapons, and

28:29.975 --> 28:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carter went over as a private
citizen and
said that economic sanctions
were off the

28:36.348 --> 28:37.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said this on television.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Clinton was absolutely
furious.

28:40.519 --> 28:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, after the
Jimmy Carter
legacy of building up the Carter
Center, a

28:45.824 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple of presidents later,
along comes Bill
Clinton, very different set of
circumstances.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Yes,
absolutely.

28:51.863 --> 28:57.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bill Clinton also had a
pretty rough landing
when he was the ex-president.

28:57.069 --> 29:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On his first day out of office,
he went to
the coffee shop in Chappaqua,
New York, to

29:02.341 --> 29:08.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get a cup of coffee, and
suddenly he was surrounded
with a phalanx of reporters,
right?

29:08.313 --> 29:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he -- they were shouting
questions at
him: Why did you pardon Marc
Rich, the fugitive

29:13.785 --> 29:14.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
financier?

29:14.786 --> 29:15.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why did you do that?

29:15.854 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And suddenly he found himself
completely naked.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't have a press office to
protect him.

29:20.525 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had no barrier between
himself and the
rest of the world.

29:24.830 --> 29:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a really rough time
for him, made
all the more rough because he
was counting

29:31.003 --> 29:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on some speeches to help him
with his debt.

29:34.539 --> 29:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you remember, he came out of
office with
$12 million in legal fees
because of the impeachment

29:40.579 --> 29:41.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proceedings.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he paid a lot to his
lawyers.

29:43.448 --> 29:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of those speeches just
disappeared overnight
because of the Marc Rich
controversy, so it

29:47.586 --> 29:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was a pretty tough time for him.

29:49.521 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You wrote, I
think, that Clinton
was described as having given a
lot of thought

29:53.959 --> 29:55.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his post-presidency.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Yes,
apparently from
the first...

29:56.862 --> 29:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While he was
president.

29:57.896 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Right.

29:59.765 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apparently, from the first day
he was in office,
he was thinking about his
post-presidency.

30:03.602 --> 30:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he set up the Clinton
Foundation when
he was still president.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he has -- he had given a
lot of thought
to it.

30:10.976 --> 30:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just those plans were a
little bit delayed
while he had to get through
those first rough

30:15.113 --> 30:17.015 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

30:17.049 --> 30:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the Clinton
Foundation and what it's been
able to accomplish,

30:20.686 --> 30:23.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to Jimmy Carter's work
at the Carter
Center?

30:23.288 --> 30:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Well,
the Clinton
Foundation is kind of the Carter
Center on

30:28.393 --> 30:29.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
steroids, right?

30:30.028 --> 30:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean -- and it reflects Bill
Clinton's personality.

30:34.299 --> 30:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when he started this Clinton
Foundation,
it is a global enterprise to do
good.

30:39.805 --> 30:40.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

30:40.806 --> 30:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have done a lot of good.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have gotten sugary drinks
out of public
schools.

30:44.810 --> 30:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have driven down the price
of AIDS medicine
in Africa.

30:49.247 --> 30:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But with the
Clinton Foundation
comes a lot of money.

30:54.286 --> 30:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have raised a lot of money,
and then
there were questions about how
that money

30:58.223 --> 31:00.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was spent.

31:00.158 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Yes,
there was questions
about how the money was spent
and whom he

31:02.160 --> 31:06.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raised the money from, the royal
Saudi family
and Blackwater.

31:06.298 --> 31:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's kind of really a lot of
murkiness,
which actually didn't help his
wife in her

31:11.236 --> 31:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential campaign, of
course.

31:13.271 --> 31:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were a lot of questions
about it.

31:15.006 --> 31:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, what Bill Clinton
did with
his post-presidency is, he
turned it into

31:21.713 --> 31:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a money-making enterprise for
himself.

31:24.649 --> 31:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, since 2001, Bill Clinton has
earned $250
million in speaking fees and in
book contracts.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one person said it, being
president is
a really, really good career
move.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:40.532 --> 31:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: His successor,
George W. Bush,
comes along, has, of course, his
own set of

31:46.371 --> 31:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues during his presidency,
and approaches
his ex-presidency very
differently.

31:50.876 --> 31:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Very
differently.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was delighted not to be
president.

31:54.212 --> 31:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tells this story that, the
day after he
left the White House, he's down
in Crawford,

31:59.284 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas, and he opens a newspaper,
and he looks
at the news, and he thinks, what
are we going

32:03.488 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do about this?

32:04.856 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he realizes, I don't
have to do anything
about this.

32:08.293 --> 32:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is no longer on my watch.

32:10.028 --> 32:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he closes up the papers, he
grabs his
two dogs, drives to the office
and starts

32:15.233 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
writing anecdotes for his book.

32:17.169 --> 32:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he absolutely loved being
away from -- what
I understand, from the everyday
pressures

32:24.576 --> 32:26.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the presidency.

32:26.044 --> 32:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he's been one
of the less
visible former presidents.

32:29.748 --> 32:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Yes.

32:30.749 --> 32:31.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, he has.

32:31.750 --> 32:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
account for that?

32:32.818 --> 32:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: I think
it's personality.

32:34.419 --> 32:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His speechwriter said that the
reason he seems
content is because he is
content.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He isn't trying to burnish his
legacy.

32:40.926 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's unbothered about the
criticism of his
eight years in office, the wars
and the recession

32:46.998 --> 32:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and all of that.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what he does is, he does
the things
that give him meaning and
purpose.

32:52.237 --> 32:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's pivoted toward his friends,
toward mountain
biking, toward golfing.

32:58.043 --> 33:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, he goes to Africa and he
looks in on
the clinics and things like
that.

33:01.813 --> 33:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you know what he's really
into right now
is, he's into painting, took it
very seriously.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He took lessons.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He does it hours every day, and
now he's painting.

33:11.690 --> 33:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's painted war veterans, many
of them wounded,
as a kind of tribute to them.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's talk
about President
Obama.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Yes.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's out of
office.

33:22.601 --> 33:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got his own eight-year
legacy, and a
very different set of
circumstances than he

33:28.240 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anticipated as he left office.

33:29.808 --> 33:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: This
election really
muddied the waters.

33:32.811 --> 33:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a sense that the world
was Barack
Obama's oyster.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could do anything he wanted.

33:38.650 --> 33:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could work on gun control or
race relations
or criminal justice reform,
climate change.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could own a basketball team.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He could teach law.

33:47.492 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could do anything he wanted.

33:49.361 --> 33:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day after the election, we
realized that
his opportunities were
circumscribed, at least

33:54.766 --> 34:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the beginning, because
there's a Republican
president and Congress who is
actually actively

34:00.739 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeking to undo some of his
greatest achievements.

34:03.575 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's really interesting
about this time
is, this election actually gave
him a new,

34:10.248 --> 34:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unexpected purpose, because the
Clintons are
no longer really the head of the
Democratic

34:16.121 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the senior statesman in the
Democratic
Party.

34:20.358 --> 34:26.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knows that he needs to begin
to work on
developing new talent, bringing
the party

34:26.731 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along.

34:27.832 --> 34:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he's got this short-term
purpose as
well.

34:29.668 --> 34:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other thing
about President
Obama was the importance to him
of family.

34:34.506 --> 34:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked -- he spoke about
living over the
store, being able to have dinner
every night

34:38.310 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with his daughters.

34:39.444 --> 34:42.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that will affect his life
post-presidency.

34:42.747 --> 34:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: You
know, Erik Erikson,
the great psychologist, said you
need three

34:46.518 --> 34:47.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things for midlife.

34:47.686 --> 34:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You need work, love and play.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has -- he will find
meaningful work.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he has play.

34:55.293 --> 35:00.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He bodysurfs and plays
basketball and reads
voraciously, and then love.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's got a lot of friends, but
he's got his
family.

35:02.067 --> 35:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this was a man who spent
his childhood
kind of without a father.

35:06.938 --> 35:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in many ways, he defines
himself more
as a dad and a husband than he
does as a president

35:13.611 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or an ex-president.

35:15.447 --> 35:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, kind of one of the -- one of
the things
that people told me is that
leaving the White

35:20.118 --> 35:22.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House is not going to be
difficult for him.

35:22.721 --> 35:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's going to be really
difficult is watching
his children leave the nest.

35:32.030 --> 35:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Since the shootings
at Columbine
High School in 1999, there's
been a big rise

35:46.544 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in police stationed at schools.

35:48.747 --> 35:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are 44,000 around the
country.

35:52.350 --> 35:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's led to concerns over their
role and whether
teenage behavior is sometimes
being inappropriately

35:57.956 --> 35:59.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criminalized.

35:59.758 --> 36:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new analysis of federal civil
rights data
by Education Week finds that
black students

36:04.996 --> 36:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are more likely to attend
schools with police
officers present, and they are
three times

36:09.968 --> 36:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more likely to be arrested on
campus than
white students.

36:14.105 --> 36:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with
our partner Education Week has a
report on

36:19.044 --> 36:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the St. Paul public schools
in Minnesota
are revamping their approach.

36:24.315 --> 36:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is from our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

36:27.652 --> 36:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Minnesota, it's
known for
the Vikings, Lake Wobegon, and
being nice.

36:33.992 --> 36:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the past year, a series
of violent
interactions within the St. Paul
school system

36:39.497 --> 36:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has taken center stage, school
fights, teacher
assaults, and one incident where
a visiting

36:52.010 --> 36:58.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
student was arrested for
trespassing, all
caught on cell phones and, of
course, widely

36:58.650 --> 37:01.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shared on social media.

37:01.920 --> 37:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teachers threatened to strike,
the superintendent
was fired, and more than 100
students walked

37:13.598 --> 37:15.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out in protest.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Makkah Abdur Salaam is a senior.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAKKAH ABDUR SALAAM, Student:
The truth is,
I don't feel safe around police.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, it's point blank, period.

37:22.040 --> 37:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Students like
Saffiyah Al'Aziz
Mohammed (ph) say rocky
police-civilian relations

37:27.579 --> 37:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have filtered down to schools
all over the
country.

37:30.548 --> 37:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFFIYAH AL'AZIZ MOHAMMED,
Student: Us seeing
all this police brutality in the
media, and

37:36.588 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then going to school, and then
your interactions
with school police aren't good,
it's kind

37:40.859 --> 37:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of, like, traumatizing a little
bit.

37:42.727 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Nationwide,
there were nearly
70,000 arrests during the 2013
school year.

37:48.500 --> 37:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in most states, black
students are far
more likely to be arrested,
according to an

37:53.938 --> 37:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
analysis of federal data by the
Education
Week Research Center.

37:58.910 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason might be that they
are far more
likely to be in schools with
police officers.

38:04.048 --> 38:10.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laura Olson is trying to change
the relationship
between students and police
officers in St.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Paul schools.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA OLSON, Saint Paul Public
Schools: If
students don't feel safe when
they come to

38:14.926 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, they're not going to be
in a position
to learn.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: One of the
first things she
did?

38:20.265 --> 38:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Change the uniforms.

38:21.933 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some students expressed that
they felt uncomfortable,
kind of that paramilitary look.

38:28.173 --> 38:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, over the summer, instead of
the hard military-style
blue and metal badge, they moved
to a more

38:35.780 --> 38:39.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soft blue polo shirt with
stitched-on badge.

38:39.117 --> 38:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Officers, known
as school
resource officers, are still
armed and carry

38:44.722 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tasers, but Olson hopes this
softer look makes
them more approachable.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Another change?

38:52.363 --> 38:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clarify when SRO's should step
in and when
should they step aside.

38:56.501 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA OLSON: We realized that we
had a bit
of a disconnect between what is
perceived

39:01.606 --> 39:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as behavior and what is criminal
activity.

39:05.410 --> 39:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the line between what
schools handle
and what the SRO handles?

39:10.448 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And sometimes the lines were a
little blurry.

39:13.017 --> 39:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Commander Kevin
Casper has
also increased training for SROs
in areas

39:18.256 --> 39:20.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like mental health and
de-escalation.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's creating a different
mind-set.

39:22.927 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN CASPER, Commander, St.
Paul Police Department:
We want to be more guardians
than warriors.

39:25.463 --> 39:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a family, if a mom or dad
caught their
kid with marijuana, their first
instinct wouldn't

39:30.602 --> 39:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be to turn them over to the
police and get
them into the criminal justice
system.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Casper tells of
a student
who was suicidal.

39:39.244 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN CASPER: So, the SRO kind
of like became
his life coach, coached him,
trained him,

39:46.517 --> 39:50.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and he actually made the
football team, and
he's doing great.

39:50.989 --> 39:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: That is a very
emotional
story for you.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tell me why.

39:57.028 --> 40:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN CASPER: It is personal.

40:01.666 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To think that cops don't want
the best for
the community and kids is way,
way out of

40:08.573 --> 40:11.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what I see day to day.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

40:13.077 --> 40:18.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: It's personal
for Officer
Tong Yang as well.

40:18.149 --> 40:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONG YANG, Officer: I'm also an
adviser of
the kids, social worker,
counselor, a father

40:25.823 --> 40:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure, a coach in sports, life
coach, a little
bit of everything.

40:31.195 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Now Yang only
gets involved
when there's an actual crime
committed.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, he works on building
relationships.

40:39.604 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONG YANG: We have been pushing
to be more
proactive, right, to be more
visible, be more

40:44.609 --> 40:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approachable, building that bond
between us
and the kids, having that trust
factor.

40:49.681 --> 40:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Most St. Paul
teachers want
SROs in schools.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They recently threatened to
strike over school
violence.

40:58.022 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHERYL BUZICKY, Teacher: As
teachers, we really
just want to feel like we're
supported fully

41:02.193 --> 41:03.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by everyone.

41:03.895 --> 41:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The new teacher
contract
now includes money for
additional supports,

41:08.399 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including counselors and social
workers.

41:11.069 --> 41:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, have efforts to overhaul
school policing
in St. Paul worked?

41:15.907 --> 41:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's barely been a year, but the
police point
to far fewer student arrests,
and administrators

41:21.579 --> 41:22.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say the school climate has
improved.

41:22.580 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But ask some students, they
aren't so sure.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAFFIYAH AL'AZIZ MOHAMMED: It's
a tough question.

41:25.083 --> 41:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAKKAH ABDUR SALAAM: I will say
it was better
than last year, but...

41:29.520 --> 41:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAFFIYAH AL'AZIZ MOHAMMED: The
year is not
over, though.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKKAH ABDUR SALAAM: Yes.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, that's true.

41:36.828 --> 41:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Kavitha
Cardoza reporting

41:41.366 --> 41:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from St. Paul, Minnesota.

41:49.307 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Finally tonight: Who
would have
thought?

41:56.280 --> 42:02.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A movie musical, set in
contemporary Los Angeles,
and it's become a commercial and
critical

42:02.286 --> 42:04.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hit.

42:04.122 --> 42:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, it was nominated for 14
Academy Awards,
tying "Titanic" and "All About
Eve" for the

42:09.427 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most nominations ever.

42:11.562 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with the
director of
"La La Land," who received two
nominations

42:16.033 --> 42:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself, including best original
screenplay.

42:19.470 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This report is part of our
ongoing coverage
of awards for the 2016 movie
season, Beyond

42:25.743 --> 42:30.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Red Carpet.

42:30.047 --> 42:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The story itself
is well-worn:
two young performers striving to
make it big

42:43.127 --> 42:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the land of the stars.

42:47.799 --> 42:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But "La La Land" aims to take an
old form,
the movie musical, and give it
renewed life

42:52.737 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and broader appeal, placing it
firmly in the
here and now.

43:01.746 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In New York recently,
32-year-old writer/director
Damien Chazelle told me it took
six years

43:07.585 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to sell studios on the film.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE, Director, "La
La Land": Not
just a musical, but an original
musical, so

43:12.690 --> 43:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're not even going to be
familiar with
the songs going in.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't even sell that.

43:17.395 --> 43:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just everything about it seems
like this could
never possibly have an audience
or make money.

43:20.731 --> 43:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But this is a
film all about
beating the odds.

43:24.268 --> 43:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz
pianist who
thinks all the great music came
from an earlier

43:29.507 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
era and is stubbornly trying to
bring it back,
and Emma Stone as an aspiring
actress struggling

43:35.413 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to land a role and wondering if
she has what
it takes.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Grew up with
movies.

43:40.418 --> 43:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Musicals, I kind of held at
arm's length for
a while, as a kid.

43:43.521 --> 43:46.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I sort of belatedly
fell head over
heels in love with them.

43:46.924 --> 43:49.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I fell in love,
specifically, with old
Hollywood musicals and...

43:49.360 --> 43:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Like such as?

43:50.595 --> 43:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: I like "Singin'
in the Rain,"
"Top Hat."

43:55.666 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, as soon as I fell in
love with
those movies, I was thinking
already about,

44:04.775 --> 44:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how could you do something like
that today?

44:08.246 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you hear
in those
films?

44:14.151 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What grabbed you, at whatever
age you were?

44:16.354 --> 44:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: The reveling in
what only
movies can do, the sort of
unbridled experimentation,

44:22.827 --> 44:30.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the audacity, the privileging of
emotion over
anything else, the privileging
of image and

44:31.002 --> 44:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sound and telling a story that
way, not just
telling it through dialogue or
through things

44:36.574 --> 44:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you could do in literature
or in a play,
but really just indulging in the
possibilities

44:43.581 --> 44:45.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the medium.

44:45.383 --> 44:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just felt like they were --
musicals were
the most liberating form for a
filmmaker.

44:48.352 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
The
language of falling in love
through dance,

44:57.795 --> 45:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially in a movie like "Top
Hat" or a
movie like "Swing Time," a
number like, "Isn't

45:01.799 --> 45:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It a Lovely Day to Be Caught in
the Rain?"
which is one of the early
numbers in "Top

45:05.803 --> 45:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hat," the bickering couple,
where the dialogue
is telling you that they're not
in love, but

45:11.142 --> 45:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they start to kind of sing and
they start
to dance.

45:13.611 --> 45:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the song and the dance is
what tells you,
oh, actually, there's something
underneath

45:26.223 --> 45:28.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

45:28.059 --> 45:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're also
working here with
actors Ryan Gosling and Emma
Stone, who are

45:38.235 --> 45:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not known for singing and
dancing.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes.

45:41.505 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the intention was to not
have it be
people who you had seen in a
musical before,

45:44.742 --> 45:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it's not a situation where
you're kind
of sitting there waiting for
them to break

45:47.244 --> 45:49.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into song, you know?

45:49.046 --> 45:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wanted to cast actors, first
and foremost,
and just people who would really
flesh out

45:52.249 --> 45:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these characters with the same
amount of depth
and complexity and truth as they
would if

45:56.988 --> 46:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were no musical numbers in
the movie
at all to help the lifting.

46:07.098 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were no musical numbers in
the movie
at all to help the lifting.

46:15.906 --> 46:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the numbers can kind of
emerge out
of the emotions that the actors
have fleshed

46:20.578 --> 46:22.279 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

46:22.313 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was much more important
to me than
the technique of the steps or
the notes.

46:25.483 --> 46:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film is
received some criticism
for its portrayal of Gosling, a
white man,

46:33.924 --> 46:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to save a distinctly
black art form,
jazz.

46:37.862 --> 46:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jazz is a longtime love of
Chazelle's.

46:41.932 --> 46:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He first gained widespread
attention in 2014
with "Whiplash," about a young
drummer who

46:47.571 --> 46:53.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
worships the greats and
desperately wants
to join them, and an abusive
music professor

46:53.277 --> 46:57.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who pushes him to the brink of
insanity.

46:57.248 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chazelle himself was an aspiring
jazz drummer
in high school.

47:04.789 --> 47:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: I love thinking
about film
as music, and how the two forms
can speak

47:13.397 --> 47:14.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to each other.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What does that
mean, film as
music?

47:16.300 --> 47:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Well, you know,
that it's
not just about putting a camera
on someone

47:19.870 --> 47:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and -- or on a couple of people
and having
them talk, and doing
shot/reverse shot, and

47:23.174 --> 47:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just sort of trying to passively
tell a story.

47:25.976 --> 47:31.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's trying to -- you're trying
to ultimately
say things that words can't say.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, that can be done
very simply.

47:34.385 --> 47:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other times, it's done in very,
I guess what
you would call musical ways,
thinking about

47:38.089 --> 47:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rhythm and tempo, playing with
the sequence
of shots in an edit room, or
trying to make

47:42.460 --> 47:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the camera dance, trying to make
the camera
evoke a certain kind of melody
or tempo.

47:46.764 --> 47:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But also thinking
about jazz
and musicals not as, I don't
want to say dying

47:53.804 --> 47:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
art forms -- I love both, but --
and they
thrive in some forms, but
they're not part

47:58.776 --> 47:59.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the popular culture.

47:59.777 --> 48:01.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes.

48:01.078 --> 48:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're not sort
of a mainstream,
mass culture.

48:02.346 --> 48:03.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes.

48:03.581 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And yet you're
clearly attracted
to both.

48:04.615 --> 48:05.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes.

48:05.783 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And I wonder what
that says
about you.

48:07.585 --> 48:11.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes, sometimes,
I have felt
a little bit like I was born,
whatever, in

48:11.956 --> 48:12.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wrong...

48:12.957 --> 48:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the wrong era.

48:14.725 --> 48:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: The wrong era,
yes, which,
I think, at least Ryan Gosling's
character

48:18.629 --> 48:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this movie, he certainly --
his character
shares that viewpoint.

48:23.434 --> 48:31.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was sort of personal.

48:31.408 --> 48:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the story of the movie that
Ryan Gosling's
character ultimately has to
learn is that

48:34.912 --> 48:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are limits to that kind of
nostalgia.

48:36.781 --> 48:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's not enough to, I think,
just love
something from the past and kind
of encase

48:42.019 --> 48:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it in amber and say, don't
touch, because
that actually winds up -- to a
certain extent,

48:48.559 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it winds up aiding its demise.

48:51.162 --> 48:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to actually help an
art form or
sort of contribute to it in some
ways, you

48:56.767 --> 48:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to find a way to add
something new.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to update it.

49:00.271 --> 49:05.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're very
young.

49:05.776 --> 49:13.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does the ambition come
from to kind
of bring back the musical, to
think long term,

49:13.551 --> 49:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the arc of a career?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: I guess I'm not
entirely
sure.

49:16.854 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one thing I sort of have
adopted for myself
as some kind of mantra is just
to try to make

49:21.458 --> 49:24.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that scare you a little
bit, to try...

49:24.829 --> 49:25.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scare you?

49:26.030 --> 49:27.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Yes.

49:27.865 --> 49:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you have done something,
don't redo it,
or don't sort of stay completely
in that box.

49:31.068 --> 49:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Try to play around and try to
keep pushing,
and even if that means you fall
on your face.

49:36.874 --> 49:40.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's kind of the only
movie you really
want to make, in a way, because,
otherwise,

49:40.311 --> 49:41.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what are you doing?

49:41.445 --> 49:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's so much work to make a
movie.

49:43.180 --> 49:48.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's so tiring, that it's like,
you might
as well be doing something that
is really

49:48.285 --> 49:52.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing you and that is really,
if it works
out, going to push the medium
forward.

49:52.089 --> 49:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now Damien
Chazelle will vie
for best director and "La La
Land" for best

49:57.361 --> 50:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
film at the Academy Awards on
February 26.

50:01.632 --> 50:08.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

50:08.806 --> 50:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Online: What does it
take to write
an Oscar-nominated song?

50:16.146 --> 50:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk to "La La Land" composer
Justin Hurwitz
about creating the music that
has a starring

50:21.852 --> 50:23.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role in the movie.

50:32.730 --> 50:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:37.234 --> 50:42.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Frontline": a
look back
at how President Trump won the
2016 election.

50:42.206 --> 50:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Trump's Road to the White
House" draws on
interviews with Trump and
Clinton campaign

50:46.777 --> 50:50.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insiders to dig into Trump's
unconventional
strategy.

50:51.015 --> 50:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Donald Trump is back on the
road campaigning.

50:55.786 --> 51:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: He caused controversy
from the very
start, in Iowa, as he was
interviewed by Republican

51:01.692 --> 51:03.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pollster Frank Luntz.

51:03.494 --> 51:07.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ, Founder, Luntz
Global: And he
and I get into an exchange over
John McCain,

51:07.298 --> 51:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because he's taking shots at
McCain, and I
thought they were gratuitous.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: He's not a war hero.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: He's a war hero.

51:14.204 --> 51:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a war hero...

51:15.472 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: Five-and-a-half
years as a prisoner...

51:16.473 --> 51:17.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:17.708 --> 51:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a war hero
because he was
captured.

51:19.009 --> 51:19.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like people that weren't
captured, OK, I
hate to tell you.

51:19.877 --> 51:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: Do you agree with
that?

51:21.111 --> 51:23.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a war hero
because he was
captured.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: I couldn't believe
he said that.

51:25.950 --> 51:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was completely stunned.

51:28.352 --> 51:31.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone in that room thought,
this is it.

51:31.488 --> 51:32.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's over.

51:32.723 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Folks, I want to
make America
great again.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to get down to brass
tacks.

51:36.427 --> 51:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want to listen to his
stuff with
being politically correct and
everything has

51:41.098 --> 51:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- we have a lot of work to do.

51:43.033 --> 51:45.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, Former Trump
Campaign Manager:
I asked Mr. Trump after he came
off the stage

51:45.069 --> 51:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have a private conversation
with him.

51:47.037 --> 51:48.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, I think we need to
fix this.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when I said fix it, I meant
an apology.

51:50.941 --> 51:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump understood
things that I
didn't understand about the
American people,

51:53.777 --> 51:55.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, no, no, you don't
understand.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: Trump refused to
apologize.

51:57.281 --> 52:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY LEWANDOWSKI: And once I
understood that
he was willing to double down on
his comments

52:01.151 --> 52:05.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and being a fighter for what he
believes in,
I'm all in.

52:05.255 --> 52:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm in there with you to
support you,.

52:06.957 --> 52:07.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Don voyage.

52:08.025 --> 52:09.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump is toast after insults.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Everything erupted after
that speech.

52:11.528 --> 52:13.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Virtually every
Republican criticized
Trump.

52:13.998 --> 52:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: This clip is played
on every
newscast for the next 24 hours.

52:17.001 --> 52:20.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So far, Trump's political
campaign operates
with a no guts, no glory
approach.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ: And he survived it.

52:22.339 --> 52:28.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He survived walls and Mexicans
and everything.

52:28.379 --> 52:30.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That which doesn't kill us makes
us stronger.

52:30.681 --> 52:34.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you ever needed any
evidence, just
look at Donald Trump.

52:34.752 --> 52:42.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
