FROM PEOPLE AT THE POLLS HERE?

02:40.100 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME SAY IT WASN'T A VOTE FOR

HIM, IT WAS A VOTE AGAINST THE

OPPOSITION.

02:46.366 --> 02:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THIS IS -- IF YOU LOOK

02:50.833 --> 02:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE NUMBERS, IT LOOKS LIKE A

02:54.533 --> 02:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY SUBSTANTIAL VICTORY.

02:58.266 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
65 VERSUS 35%.

02:59.866 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE REAL NUMBERS THAT

03:01.566 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY VOTED FOR MACRON IT IS

03:03.933 --> 03:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT THAT BIG.

03:05.366 --> 03:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CANNOT REALLY REGARD THIS AS

03:06.900 --> 03:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING A COMPLETE MANDATE, A

03:09.300 --> 03:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULAR MANDATE BECAUSE THERE

03:10.400 --> 03:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO

03:12.200 --> 03:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSTAINED AND OVERALL THERE WERE

03:13.900 --> 03:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY ABOUT 20 MILLION FRENCH

03:16.233 --> 03:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTERS WHO ACTUALLY VOTED FOR

03:17.466 --> 03:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM AND THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD

03:20.033 --> 03:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE COUNTRY.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR

03:24.133 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM WEREN'T NECESSARILY VOTING

03:25.100 --> 03:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HIM, THEY WERE VOTING

03:26.866 --> 03:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TACTICALLY.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO MORE THAN

03:29.733 --> 03:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING ELSE IS MARINE LE PEN

03:34.133 --> 03:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM GETTING INTO THE PALACE.

DIFFICULTY OF GOVERNING NOW.

03:41.366 --> 03:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> VERY MUCH SO.

03:42.866 --> 03:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE ABILITY TO

03:45.266 --> 03:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPOINT A PRIME MINISTER AND

03:48.300 --> 03:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VARIOUS OTHER MINISTERS.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT LIKE THE U.S. PRESIDENT HE

03:52.200 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDS TO HAVE THE FRENCH

03:53.833 --> 03:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARLIAMENT WITH HIM AND FRENCH

03:57.133 --> 03:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS ARE

03:58.466 --> 04:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING UP IN JUNE AND HE HAS NOT

04:01.500 --> 04:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY REAL PARTY FORMATION OR

04:03.700 --> 04:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTY HISTORY.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS SOMEHOW GOT TO GET ABOUT

04:06.833 --> 04:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
270 PEOPLE INTO PARLIAMENT IF

04:08.233 --> 04:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S TO HAVE HIS MOVEMENT IN THE

04:10.266 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY THERE.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE

04:12.400 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY GOING TO SEE IS NOT SO

04:15.100 --> 04:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER PARTIES DOING THEIR

04:18.033 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UTMOST TO TRY TO STYMIE HIM.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR THE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS HE

04:21.733 --> 04:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAY FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

04:23.400 --> 04:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET HIS POLICIES THROUGH

04:24.833 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY IF THE PARLIAMENT
