JUDY WOODRUFF: Last year, former
President Obama and China's
President Xi Jinping announced

00:07.100 --> 00:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the same day that the U.S.
and China would join the Paris
climate agreement, in an effort

00:11.700 --> 00:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to forestall climate
change through capping
and reducing emissions.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China's participation
was seen as key.

00:17.933 --> 00:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the world's
largest emitter of carbon
dioxide, with the United
States running second.

00:24.466 --> 00:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on June 1, this month,
President Trump announced his
intention to withdraw from the

00:30.533 --> 00:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement, citing possible
economic harm to the U.S. Four
days later, the top American

00:36.400 --> 00:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official in China, the charge
d'affaires in Beijing, tendered
his resignation, citing

00:40.866 --> 00:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's withdrawal.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His name is David Rank.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He served 27 years in
the Foreign Service.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he joins me now
for his first interview
since leaving government.

00:50.766 --> 00:52.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Rank, welcome.

00:52.833 --> 00:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You knew, when Donald Trump
was running for president,
that he had said that the U.S.

00:58.066 --> 01:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shouldn't be in
this climate accord.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was your thinking then?

01:02.200 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK, Former U.S.
Diplomat: Boy, I have served
five presidents over 27 years.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been through a lot
of presidential campaigns.

01:08.066 --> 01:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have heard a lot of
things both about the
U.S.-China relationship
and about other issues.

01:14.766 --> 01:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suppose I thought, boy,
that's bad idea but there are
a lot of bad ideas talked about

01:17.300 --> 01:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in presidential campaigns,
and we will see what happens
when he becomes president.

01:24.266 --> 01:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when
he made that announcement,
what was your reaction?

01:30.100 --> 01:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: You know, Judy, up
until the day he -- in fact,
I would say the day before,

01:34.300 --> 01:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I -- it kind of
caught me off-guard.

01:36.266 --> 01:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed so improbable that
the U.S. would pull out, because
Paris is a symbol of U.S.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leadership in the
region, in the world.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the benefits that
accrue from being a leader and
being in Paris just seemed to

01:55.066 --> 01:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be so obvious that it sort
of caught me off-guard.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were
the benefits, in your mind?

02:01.400 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Look, the -- how
many agreements are there in
the world where two countries,

02:08.366 --> 02:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now all but three countries
in the world, are members,
countries that are sort of the

02:10.200 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
closest partners we
have had for 70 years?

02:13.400 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's one of the most important
issues to those countries.

02:17.233 --> 02:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the benefits of being
the leader in that, of, as you
said, working together with

02:24.333 --> 02:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China to bring about, to
make the Paris agreement
possible, and being the
true leader on climate

02:31.500 --> 02:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues, really is a
remarkable benefit.

02:35.866 --> 02:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why does
climate matter to you?

02:39.700 --> 02:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Well, as I explained
to my staff when I went, not
only did it bother me from

02:47.900 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the perspective of bad policy,
but also the obligation we
have to our kids and, frankly,

02:54.966 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the moral obligation I feel
to take care of the planet we
have been given and the planet

03:00.500 --> 03:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we leave our children and
their children, and, you know,
realizing that if we -- from

03:07.466 --> 03:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of those perspectives, ask
even to take very small steps,
I realized that I couldn't

03:12.100 --> 03:13.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't in good conscience
be party to the U.S. withdrawal.

03:16.566 --> 03:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we have a
disciplined service.

03:19.033 --> 03:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You either agree to
implement the president's
policy or you step aside.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that was the
solution I put forward.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, his argument
that this was doing economic
harm to the U.S., he talked

03:32.833 --> 03:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about draconian repercussions
for the U.S. thanks to the
accord, and he said he wanted

03:39.166 --> 03:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to negotiate a new
deal on climate?

03:41.466 --> 03:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID RANK: I'm quick to admit
I'm not an expert on climate.

03:48.466 --> 03:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And had there been a serious
proposal, had we said, look,
Paris is -- instead of Paris,

03:54.300 --> 03:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we want to do X, Y or Z, you
probably would have changed
the way I looked at it.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There hasn't been any
real indication of that.

04:01.733 --> 04:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I suspect -- well, I will
wait and see from the outside.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How difficult
a decision is this for you?

04:07.733 --> 04:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been in the Foreign
Service for 27 years.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Yes, I love my job.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I love the people I work with.

04:15.633 --> 04:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think -- I would like to
think I got up every morning,
and with a feeling of gratitude

04:22.800 --> 04:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the ability to do what
I was doing, to serve the
American people, to work with a

04:29.766 --> 04:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of colleagues who
were committed to the
same sorts of goals I am.

04:35.866 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was tough.

04:37.933 --> 04:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was very difficult.

04:40.033 --> 04:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
you could have stayed.

04:42.133 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess did anybody make
the argument you could stay
and fight and stand up for

04:45.900 --> 04:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what you believe in?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID RANK: Absolutely.

04:48.066 --> 04:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think there's
honor in that.

04:50.066 --> 04:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I made the case to the
folks, because there are a
lot of people who I think, not

04:53.566 --> 04:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just in the embassy in Beijing,
but across the State Department
and across the government,

05:00.533 --> 05:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are asking themselves,
if I fundamentally
disagree, what do I do?

05:05.466 --> 05:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my answer to that
is, look, I have my own
particular personal situation.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm relatively close to the
end of my career, or I was.

05:12.066 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had been in for
almost 30 years.

05:14.633 --> 05:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you have got 20 years
ahead of you, then there's
real honor, honor to doing the

05:21.633 --> 05:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of tough work, the slow and
steady work that we as diplomats
and really people throughout

05:27.133 --> 05:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. government -- I
mean, that's the role of the
civil servant, the role of the

05:30.500 --> 05:32.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public servant.

05:32.133 --> 05:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think it is and
will continue to be
an honorable role.

05:35.566 --> 05:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing, and
separate from this decision,
how do you see the state of

05:42.533 --> 05:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relations right now between the
United States and China, with
President Trump pressing the

05:45.933 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese in particular to lean
on the North Koreans to pull
back their nuclear program?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID RANK: I think we're early
in the Trump administration.

05:54.433 --> 05:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's a positive
thing that the president
and his senior advisers
have made it clear

06:01.400 --> 06:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's an important
issue, that we have to
grapple with North Korea.

06:04.266 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's not the only
issue between the United
States and China, but certainly

06:07.633 --> 06:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is the one that is
on the front burner.

06:11.266 --> 06:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it will
be a challenge.

06:13.366 --> 06:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will take hard work every
day, not just by the president,
not just by the secretary

06:18.033 --> 06:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state, but by the colleagues
of mine who are still in
Beijing and colleagues in the

06:24.966 --> 06:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
State Department and
the Department of
Defense and elsewhere
in the U.S. government.

06:26.866 --> 06:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a real challenge
to the United States.

06:28.933 --> 06:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Rank, the
former charge d'affaires at
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,

06:34.966 --> 06:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, up until, what,
about eight or 10 days ago.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID RANK: That's right.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you very
much for talking with us.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID RANK: Judy,
thank you very much.
