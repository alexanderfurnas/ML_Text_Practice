JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.442 --> 00:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Did ExxonMobil mislead
the public about its

00:13.947 --> 00:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change research? New
York's attorney general lays out
details of his new
investigation,

00:19.586 --> 00:22.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and an Exxon vice
president responds.

00:22.489 --> 00:27.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: in the footsteps of our
ancestors. Journalist Paul

00:27.694 --> 00:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Salopek walks around the world
to uncover humans' prehistoric
journey.

00:32.566 --> 00:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic: The walk has opened
up the vista to me in

00:36.570 --> 00:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both space and time, where I can
see the connections between all
of these stories and I see how

00:40.574 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history informs everything
that's happening today.

00:43.777 --> 00:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And "Breaking
Bad" actor Bryan Cranston talks
about playing a blacklisted

00:49.182 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
screenwriter at the height of
the Red Scare in the 1950s.

00:53.453 --> 00:58.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON, Actor: A lot of
people will look back and say
that he's a hero. There

00:58.225 --> 01:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are other people who will say,
he was no hero, he's a dirty red
commie or whatever. And I

01:02.696 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suppose the point of the movie
is that all opinions are
welcome.

01:06.566 --> 01:13.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:13.440 --> 01:17.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.577 --> 01:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republicans prepared
today for their fourth
presidential debate, this time

01:26.820 --> 01:32.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Milwaukee. The top eight
polling candidates, a smaller
field than before, will face off

01:32.326 --> 01:36.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on economic issues on FOX
Business Network at 9:00 Eastern
time. Lower-polling candidates

01:36.964 --> 01:38.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meet earlier.

01:38.699 --> 01:44.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama
administration will ask the U.S.
Supreme Court to let it protect

01:44.604 --> 01:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five million immigrants from
deportation. That's after a
federal appeals court panel

01:50.143 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruled against the president's
executive orders to do just
that. Monday's ruling upheld an

01:55.015 --> 01:59.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
injunction issued by a
federal judge in Texas.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, White House spokesman
Josh Earnest said the
administration is determined to
continue

02:03.256 --> 02:05.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fight.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: We're quite
disappointed in the decision
that

02:07.527 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was rendered by the Fifth
Circuit, but it did not in any
way diminish the confidence

02:12.866 --> 02:17.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have in the power of our
legal argument. And we're
looking forward to having an
opportunity

02:17.037 --> 02:20.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making that argument again
before the Supreme Court.

02:20.207 --> 02:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In all, 26 states
have challenged the president's
actions on immigration, saying

02:24.644 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
they illegally
circumvent Congress.

02:28.248 --> 02:32.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The Senate
overwhelmingly passed a defense
bill today that includes a ban
on

02:32.886 --> 02:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moving Guantanamo Bay detainees
to the United States. It's the
latest obstacle to President

02:38.825 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama's pledge to close the
detention facility before he
leaves office. Still, the White

02:44.598 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House said he will sign the $600
billion measure because of other
important provisions.

02:49.803 --> 02:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The worst El Nino
weather pattern in decades could
threaten 11 million children

02:56.176 --> 03:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Africa with hunger, disease
and drought. The United Nations
Children's Fund, UNICEF,

03:01.648 --> 03:04.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issued that warning today.

03:04.718 --> 03:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, it said: "The
consequences could ripple
through generations, unless
affected

03:09.122 --> 03:12.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
communities receive support."

03:12.426 --> 03:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The weather pattern has already
caused severe drought in
Ethiopia and flooding in
Somalia.

03:18.331 --> 03:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Myanmar, official
results from Sunday's elections
kept trickling in today,

03:24.738 --> 03:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the opposition claimed a
landslide win. The country's
constitution bars opposition

03:29.042 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leader Aung San Suu Kyi
from becoming president.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she told Singapore's Channel
News Asia she expects to be the
de facto leader.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUNG SAN SUU KYI, Myanmar
Opposition Leader: In any
democratic country, it's the
leader

03:40.787 --> 03:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the winning party who becomes
the leader of the government,
and if this constitution

03:46.526 --> 03:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't allow it, then we will
have to make arrangements so
that we can proceed along

03:51.631 --> 03:54.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
usual democratic lines.

03:54.501 --> 03:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Myanmar's military
gave way to an elected regime in
2011, but it retains

03:59.005 --> 04:02.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
control of key parts
of the government.

04:02.476 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia now says
its ban on flights to Egypt will
last at least the next

04:07.147 --> 04:12.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several months over security
concerns. A Russian airliner
crashed in the Sinai Peninsula
on

04:12.953 --> 04:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
October 31 after taking off from
Sharm el-Sheikh. All 224 people
on board were killed. U.S.

04:20.460 --> 04:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and British officials say it's
likely a bomb destroyed the
plane.

04:25.031 --> 04:30.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Russian sports
officials are denying
accusations of widespread doping
among track

04:30.804 --> 04:35.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and field athletes. The World
Anti-Doping Agency said
yesterday that Moscow has
allowed

04:35.075 --> 04:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a state-sponsored drug culture.

04:38.411 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the head of the country's
athletics federation dismissed
the report and said it

04:42.215 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouldn't block Russian athletes
from next year's Olympics.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VADIM ZELICHENOK, Acting
President, Russian Athletics
Federation (through translator):

04:49.556 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am sorry. I want to ask once
again, what are these athletes
guilty of? They have never

04:54.795 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had any record of doping
violations. Why should they be
deprived of this opportunity
because

04:59.566 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the corruption you have
mentioned and which had taken
place several years ago? In any

05:02.836 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
case, currently,
it doesn't exist.

05:05.839 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Vladimir
Putin will meet with the head of
the Russian Track Federation

05:10.243 --> 05:13.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tomorrow. Today, Putin's
spokesman said the accusations
appear to be -- quote -- "rather

05:13.914 --> 05:16.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfounded."

05:16.016 --> 05:21.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Federal
prosecutors in New York have
charged three people in a huge
theft

05:21.021 --> 05:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of consumer data from the
nation's biggest bank. An
indictment unsealed today said
two

05:26.560 --> 05:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israelis and an American stole
information on more than 80
million households and small

05:32.866 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business customers at J.P.
Morgan Chase. The crimes were
carried out between 2012 and
this

05:37.270 --> 05:39.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past summer.

05:39.639 --> 05:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This was a sluggish
day on Wall Street. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained

05:44.811 --> 05:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
27 points to close near 17760.
The Nasdaq lost 12 points, and
the S&amp;P 500 added three.

05:53.453 --> 05:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word this
evening former President Jimmy
Carter is responding well

05:58.124 --> 06:04.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to cancer treatment. A
spokeswoman says doctors have
found no sign of new tumors. Mr.
Carter

06:04.030 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is 91. He announced last August
that he'd been diagnosed with
cancer that spread to

06:08.134 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his brain.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We are also
marking two passings of note.

06:13.673 --> 06:19.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt died at his home
in Hamburg. Schmidt led West

06:19.613 --> 06:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Germany from 1974 to 1982,
through economic turbulence and
Cold War tensions. He also

06:26.653 --> 06:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
backed the U.S. boycott of the
Moscow Olympics in 1980, but
said later that nothing was
gained

06:31.591 --> 06:35.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from it. Helmut Schmidt
was 96 years old.

06:35.528 --> 06:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And legendary New
Orleans musician Allen Toussaint
died in Spain today after

06:41.434 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a heart attack. He was a pianist
and performer who wrote and
produced a long line of hits

06:46.806 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for himself and others,
including "Working in a Coal
Mine" and "Lady Marmalade."

06:51.945 --> 06:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here he is recording "Who's
Gonna Help Brother Get Further?"
for a 2006 album with Elvis

06:57.817 --> 07:04.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

(MUSIC)

07:10.363 --> 07:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Toussaint joined
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in 1998 and was awarded

07:32.452 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the National Humanities Medal in
2013. At his death, he was 77
years old.

07:38.358 --> 07:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour": accused of a
cover-up, Exxon's own research

07:43.530 --> 07:48.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on climate change; the largest
strike yet for a $15 minimum
wage; the man who's walking

07:48.902 --> 07:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
across the world, and much more.

07:55.075 --> 08:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: First, a new tack
in the battle over climate
change: going after energy
companies

08:08.488 --> 08:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for alleged financial fraud.

08:12.158 --> 08:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York State Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman recently
subpoenaed oil giant ExxonMobil,

08:17.931 --> 08:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apparently seeking documents
that might show the company had
downplayed the risks to profits

08:24.070 --> 08:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and therefore to investors of
stronger regulations on burning
fossil fuels. Exxon's history
has

08:30.110 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been the subject of recent
reporting by Inside Climate
News, The Los Angeles Times and
others.

08:36.616 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reporting has alleged the
company misled the public about
what its own scientists found

08:41.388 --> 08:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the risks of climate
change and greenhouse gases.

08:45.325 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here is a clip of a video
produced by PBS' "Frontline" in
collaboration with Inside
Climate

08:51.998 --> 08:57.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
News, a not-for-profit
journalism organization that
covers energy and the
environment.

08:57.137 --> 09:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Proponents of the global
warming theory say that higher
levels of greenhouse gases

09:04.010 --> 09:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are causing world temperatures
to rise and that burning fossil
fuels is the reason.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The scientific evidence remains
inconclusive as to whether human
activities affect the

09:14.320 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
global climate.

09:19.626 --> 09:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We found a trail of
comes that go back to 1977.

09:29.869 --> 09:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exxon knew carbon dioxide was
increasing in the atmosphere,
that combustion of fossil

09:36.576 --> 09:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fuels was driving it, and that
this posed a threat to Exxon. At
that time, Exxon understood

09:46.853 --> 09:53.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very quickly that governments
would probably take action to
reduce fossil fuel consumption.

09:53.460 --> 09:57.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're smart people, great
scientists, and they saw the
writing on the wall.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's a
"Frontline" excerpt.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke earlier this evening
with New York State Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman.

10:04.537 --> 10:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome, Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman.

10:08.808 --> 10:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me just begin by asking in
-- what is it that ExxonMobil
has done, in your view,

10:14.581 --> 10:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that caused you to launch
this investigation?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN, New York
Attorney General: We have been
looking at the energy sector

10:19.719 --> 10:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generally for a number of years,
and have -- had several
investigations that relate

10:26.793 --> 10:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the phenomenon of global
warming, climate change, and the
human contribution to it.

10:31.965 --> 10:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have subpoenaed, issued a
broad subpoena to Exxon because
of public statements they

10:38.271 --> 10:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made and how they have
really shifted their point of
view on this in terms of their

10:44.010 --> 10:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public presentation and public
reporting over the last few
decades.

10:49.716 --> 10:55.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 1980s, they were putting
out some very good studies about
climate change. They were

10:55.021 --> 11:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to Bell Labs as being
at the leadership of doing good
scientific work. And then they

11:00.660 --> 11:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changed tactics for some reason,
and their numerous statements
over the last 20 years

11:05.899 --> 11:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or so that question climate
change, whether it's happening,
that claim that there is no

11:11.404 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
competent model for
climate change.

11:14.307 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're very interested in
seeing what science Exxon has
been using for its own purposes,

11:20.513 --> 11:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're tremendously
active in offshore oil drilling
in the Arctic, for example,
where

11:26.319 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
global warming is happening at a
much more rapid rate than in
more temperate zones. Were

11:30.557 --> 11:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they using the best science and
the most competent models for
their own purposes, but then
telling

11:34.994 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the public, the regulators and
shareholders, that no competent
models existed?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Things like that. We're
interested in what they were
using internally and what they
were

11:42.368 --> 11:43.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
telling the world.

11:43.770 --> 11:48.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what law
would be violated by doing this?

11:48.408 --> 11:53.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: Well, in New
York, we have laws against
defrauding the public,
defrauding

11:53.012 --> 11:55.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consumers, defrauding
shareholders.

11:55.915 --> 12:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're at the beginning of the
investigation. We have to see
what documents are in there,

12:00.453 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but certainly all of the claims
would lie in some form of fraud.

12:05.658 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I'm sure
you're not surprised to know
Exxon is categorically denying
this.

12:10.129 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CEO, Rex Tillerson, said
this week nothing could be
further from the truth.

12:15.535 --> 12:20.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the company's written
statement, they start out by
saying for many years, they have
included

12:20.373 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the information they have
about the risks of climate
change in their public filings,

12:25.311 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in their reports
to shareholders.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: We know that
they have been issuing public
statements that are at

12:30.516 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
odds with that, and that they
have been funding organizations
that are even more aggressive

12:34.854 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
climate change deniers.

12:38.024 --> 12:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have made numerous
statement, both Exxon officials
and in Exxon reports, but

12:42.495 --> 12:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also through these organizations
they fund, like the American
Enterprise Institute, ALEC,

12:47.033 --> 12:51.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the American Legislative
Exchange Council, through their
activities with the American

12:51.537 --> 12:56.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Petroleum Institute, so
directory and through other
organizations, Exxon has said a
lot

12:56.943 --> 12:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things that conflict with the
statement that they have always
been forthcoming about

12:59.846 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the realities of climate change.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me read
you, Attorney General
Schneiderman, something else
that

13:05.284 --> 13:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exxon has been saying where they
reacted to some of the reporting
that was done on this

13:07.954 --> 13:11.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is similar to
what you're describing.

13:11.124 --> 13:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say these are allegations
based on what they call
deliberately cherry-picked
statements

13:16.462 --> 13:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attributed to various ExxonMobil
employees to wrongly suggest
that conclusions were reached

13:21.934 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decades ago by researchers. He
said they were statements taken
completely out of context

13:27.407 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and ignored other available
statements at the same time.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: Well, then
they should welcome this
investigation, because, unlike

13:35.381 --> 13:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalists, my staff is going
to get to read all of the
documents in context, and they

13:40.119 --> 13:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have an opportunity to
explain the context of the
statements and whether there are
contradictions

13:43.756 --> 13:45.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

13:45.925 --> 13:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're at the very beginning
stages. We don't want to
prejudge what we're going to

13:49.862 --> 13:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find, but the public record is
troubling enough that we brought
-- that we decided we had

13:54.634 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to bring this investigation.

13:57.603 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another area that -- where they
have been active and we're
concerned about is
overestimating

14:04.844 --> 14:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the costs of switching to
renewable energy. They have
issued reports, one as recently

14:11.284 --> 14:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as last year in response to
shareholder requests and public
requests, estimating that
switching

14:17.757 --> 14:23.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over to renewables by the end of
this century would raise energy
costs, to the point that

14:23.429 --> 14:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would cost -- they would be
44 percent of the median income
of an American family.

14:28.101 --> 14:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to see how they arrived
at that conclusion, which we
believe to be vastly overstated.

14:32.405 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you draw a
line between ExxonMobil doing
research and talking openly

14:39.212 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the debate out there about
what is known about climate
change, and on the other hand

14:44.417 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advocating for policies that
they think are going to be
better for their own bottom
line?

14:48.855 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: Well, there's
nothing wrong with advocating
for your own company.

14:54.327 --> 15:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you're not allowed to do is
commit fraud. You're not allowed
to have the best climate

15:00.166 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change science that you're using
to build -- in your planning of
offshore oil towers

15:06.005 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Arctic, where you have to
take into account rising sea
levels and the melting

15:10.309 --> 15:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the permafrost and things
like that. If you're using that
internally, but what you're

15:14.413 --> 15:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting out to the world,
directly and through these
climate denial organizations, is
completely

15:18.417 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in conflict with
that, that's not OK.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New York State
Attorney General Eric Schmitt,
we thank you.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: Thank you.

15:26.325 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And joining me
now is Kenneth Cohen. He is vice
president for public and

15:30.797 --> 15:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government affairs with
ExxonMobil Corporation.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kenneth Cohen, welcome.

15:36.269 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me just begin by asking flat
out, has Exxon in any way misled
or been dishonest

15:42.508 --> 15:46.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the public about what it
knows about climate change?

15:46.245 --> 15:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH COHEN, Vice President
for Public and Government
Affairs, ExxonMobil: Well, Judy,

15:47.647 --> 15:52.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
first, thank you for the
invitation to come on tonight's
program.

15:52.585 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I also appreciate opening
with that question, because the
answer is a simple no. And what

16:00.626 --> 16:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the facts will show is that the
company has been engaged for
many decades in a two-pronged

16:06.732 --> 16:09.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity here.

16:09.268 --> 16:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, we take the risks of
climate change seriously. And we
also have been working to

16:15.641 --> 16:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand the science of
climate change. And that
activity started in the late
'70s

16:20.680 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has continued up to the
present time. Our scientists
have produced over 150 papers,

16:25.985 --> 16:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
50 of which have been part of
peer-reviewed publications.

16:30.723 --> 16:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our scientists participate in
the U.N.'s climate body. We have
been participating in the U.N.

16:37.163 --> 16:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activities beginning in 1988,
running through the present
time. At the same time, we have

16:43.269 --> 16:48.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also been engaged in
discussions on policy.

16:48.274 --> 16:55.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the discussions on
policy, for example, in the late
'90s, we were part of a large

16:55.715 --> 17:01.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business coalition that opposed
adoption in the U.S. of the
Kyoto protocol. Now, why did

17:01.420 --> 17:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we do that? We opposed the Kyoto
protocol because it would have
exempted from its application

17:07.493 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over two-thirds of the world's
emitters. Think about that. And
that was in 1997.

17:13.099 --> 17:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Going forward, if that policy
were in effect today, it would
have excluded almost 80 percent

17:18.237 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the world's emissions. So
that wasn't a good policy
approach.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about one of the points that
the attorney general

17:27.013 --> 17:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made. He said Exxon over the
last few decades, in his words,
has shifted tactics, from taking

17:32.685 --> 17:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climate change seriously,
engaging in serious research,
to, he said, much more recently

17:36.656 --> 17:40.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questioning whether
it's happening at all.

17:40.426 --> 17:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that an accurate, a fair
description of the shift that's
taken place?

17:44.530 --> 17:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH COHEN: No, it's not.
And the facts are as follows.

17:49.235 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have endeavored with -- to
understand the science of this
very complex subject, as I

17:55.574 --> 18:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mentioned, beginning in the '70s
and running to the present time.
This is a very complex

18:00.680 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
area. This is a very
complex system, climate.

18:05.785 --> 18:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we discovered, what our
scientists discovered, working
in conjunction with the U.S.
government,

18:10.656 --> 18:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Department of Energy,
working in conjunction with some
of the leading research

18:15.127 --> 18:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
institutions around the world in
the '70s and the '80s, was that
the tools available

18:20.399 --> 18:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the science to get a handle on
the risk, these tools needed to
develop, and we, for example,

18:28.240 --> 18:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were part of developing, working
with others, some of the complex
modeling that is used

18:34.580 --> 18:36.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

18:36.782 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, that work continues.
Now, on the policy side, we have
to remember that ExxonMobil

18:45.658 --> 18:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a large energy provider, one
of the world's largest energy
companies. We have a two-pronged

18:50.930 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenge in front of us. We
produce energy that the modern
world runs on.

18:56.669 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we strive to do is
produce that energy while at the
same time reducing the
environmental

19:02.475 --> 19:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
footprint associated with our
operations and, most
importantly, with consumers' use
of the

19:06.012 --> 19:07.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
energy.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I think
people understand that, but I
think what is striking was his

19:11.884 --> 19:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- was the attorney general's
comment that Exxon -- what he's
concerned about and wants

19:15.888 --> 19:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to know is whether Exxon was
using one set of scientific
models to do its work in the

19:22.228 --> 19:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arctic, for example, where Exxon
has been engaged in drilling,
and on the other hand

19:27.333 --> 19:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telling the public, telling its
shareholders a very different
set of facts about the state

19:31.804 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of climate change.

19:33.873 --> 19:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH COHEN: Well, the facts
will show that the company has
been engaged with, not only

19:40.379 --> 19:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on our own, but with -- in
conjunction with some of the
leading researchers.

19:44.683 --> 19:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our view of this very complex
subject over the years, over the
decades has mirrored that

19:51.824 --> 19:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the broader scientific
community. That is to say, the
discussions that have taken

19:56.829 --> 20:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place inside our company, among
our scientists mirror the
discussions that have been
taking

20:02.168 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place and the work that's been
taking place by the broader
scientific community.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what the facts will show.

20:07.606 --> 20:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just final
question. He made a point of
saying that Exxon has funded a

20:13.145 --> 20:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of organizations that he
said that have been openly
climate change deniers. He

20:18.617 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mentioned the American
Enterprise Institute. He
mentioned the American Petroleum
Institute

20:22.354 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and the American
Legislative Exchange.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Has Exxon been funding
these organizations?

20:26.725 --> 20:31.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH COHEN: Well, the answer
is yes. And I will let those
organizations respond for

20:31.163 --> 20:33.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

20:33.132 --> 20:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will tell you that what we
have been engaged in, both -- we
have been focused on

20:40.072 --> 20:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding the science,
participating with the broader
scientific community in
developing

20:44.076 --> 20:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the science, while at the same
time participating in
understanding what would be and
working

20:49.782 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with policy-makers on what would
be appropriate policy responses
to this evolving body of

20:54.820 --> 20:56.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
science.

20:56.755 --> 21:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we were involved with
large business coalitions
challenging the adoption of the

21:03.796 --> 21:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kyoto protocol in the United
States. And we then moved to
oppose, for example, early
adoption

21:10.803 --> 21:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of cap-and-trade approaches in
the U.S. One of the earlier
approaches in the last decade

21:15.808 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would have exempted, for
example, coal from its
operations.

21:19.745 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we favor the adoption --
policy-makers should consider
policy and should adopt policy.

21:25.951 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have disclosed the risks of
climate change to our investors
beginning in the middle part

21:32.324 --> 21:35.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the last decade and
extending to the present time.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kenneth Cohen,
vice president for ExxonMobil,
we appreciate having your

21:39.365 --> 21:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point of view, as we do the
New York attorney general.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

21:45.604 --> 21:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH COHEN: Thank you.

21:51.677 --> 21:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo moved to raise that
state's minimum wage to

21:58.784 --> 22:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$15 an hour today, a national
battle over pay played out from
coast to coast, as fast

22:04.890 --> 22:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
food and other low-wage workers
took their protests to the
streets.

22:10.596 --> 22:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of workers pushing for
an increase in the minimum wage
were expected to walk

22:15.601 --> 22:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off the job in as many as 270
cities today, with protests in
more than 200 others.

22:22.441 --> 22:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Maybe I wouldn't have to
work two jobs, and maybe I
wouldn't have to work seven days

22:26.946 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a week, you know, or even
sometimes we work on holidays
just to make a little holiday

22:31.417 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay extra.

22:33.619 --> 22:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Organizers who favor
raising the federal wage to $15
an hour planned for today's

22:39.558 --> 22:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actions to be the largest strike
ever by employees of the fast
food industry.

22:45.064 --> 22:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The federal minimum wage has
been set at $7.25 an hour since
2009. Democratic presidential

22:51.303 --> 22:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates Martin O'Malley and
Bernie Sanders back the $15
push.

22:55.741 --> 23:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: They
have had the impact of moving
Los Angeles

23:00.279 --> 23:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and San Francisco and other
cities to raise the minimum
wage. They are doing it.

23:03.916 --> 23:08.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But some Democrats
say the hike should be lower,
$12 an hour, in part because

23:08.921 --> 23:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some cities and states have
raised minimums on their own.
Hillary Clinton and Labor
Secretary

23:13.859 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Perez have said they support
a $12 measure now in Congress.
But many businesses and most

23:19.298 --> 23:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans say raising the
wage that high would cost jobs.

23:24.970 --> 23:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly all of the Republican
candidates who will debate in
Milwaukee tonight support
keeping

23:28.073 --> 23:33.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the minimum wage well
below $15 an hour.

23:33.712 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Continuing our coverage of this
ongoing debate, we turn tonight
to a prominent labor economist

23:37.983 --> 23:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who believes wages should be
raised, but not so fast and not
so high.

23:43.222 --> 23:46.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Krueger is the former
chairman of President Obama's
Council of Economic Advisers,
and

23:46.692 --> 23:49.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he's now a professor of
economics and public affairs at
Princeton University.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome, Professor Krueger.

23:52.765 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have written that the $15
raise -- you have written that
raising the minimum wage

23:59.338 --> 24:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to $15 an hour is a risk not
worth taking. Why is it not?

24:03.876 --> 24:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER, Former Chairman,
White House Council of Economic
Advisers: Well, first

24:05.878 --> 24:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all, Gwen, I would draw a
distinction between the worker
activism that you highlighted at

24:10.716 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the beginning and the
federal minimum wage.

24:14.820 --> 24:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's wonderful to see
workers get more engaged. We
have a long tradition in

24:20.159 --> 24:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country of promoting worker
voice, worker activism to
support their own pay. And I
think

24:26.498 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are certainly some sectors
that can handle a $15-an-hour
minimum, but at a national

24:31.303 --> 24:34.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
level, I think that's
a different story.

24:34.740 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to give you an example,
the research I did two decades
ago with David Card of Berkeley,

24:40.813 --> 24:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we looked at what happened when
the minimum wage in New Jersey
went from $4.25 an hour

24:46.452 --> 24:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to $5.15 an hour, which is the
equivalent today of going from
$7.25 to $8.60 an hour,

24:51.323 --> 24:54.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very far from $15.

24:54.793 --> 24:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we found was that an
increase at this more moderate
level, well above where

24:59.732 --> 25:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is today, didn't have an
adverse effect on employment.
Other studies have reached

25:03.202 --> 25:03.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a similar conclusion.

25:03.402 --> 25:03.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:03.669 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Pardon me.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN KRUEGER: Yes.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So you're suggesting
-- just moving it to today for a
moment -- that the difference

25:08.240 --> 25:12.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between $12 and $15
an hour is what?

25:12.444 --> 25:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: No, the point I'm
making is an increase to $12 at
a national level is

25:18.784 --> 25:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a considerable increase. It
would put the minimum wage above
where it's been in the

25:21.987 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
history of the United States.

25:25.891 --> 25:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you move it up to $15 an
hour nationwide, I'm concerned
that that is well beyond what

25:32.831 --> 25:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have seen in past research.
And if I were advising the
president today, I would say

25:35.701 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's a risky level.

25:38.470 --> 25:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why is it even
necessary for there to be a
federal floor, when so many
states

25:43.542 --> 25:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and cities are stepping in?
That's what a lot of Republicans
are saying.

25:47.413 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: Well, most of the
Republican candidates favor
keeping the minimum wage

25:52.651 --> 25:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it is or getting rid of
it, from what I have heard in
the earlier debates. And I

25:55.020 --> 25:59.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hope they get asked
about that tonight.

25:59.224 --> 26:05.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have in some sense a
nationwide labor market. The
minimum wage is a standard of
fairness.

26:05.631 --> 26:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also use the minimum wage to
help redress the imbalance in
bargaining power between

26:11.703 --> 26:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
employers and firms. And I think
if we abolish the federal
minimum wage, which is what you

26:16.775 --> 26:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked about, you would have some
states that didn't have a
minimum wage at all or a very

26:20.846 --> 26:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
low one, and that would be
unfair to other states that have
a higher minimum wage.

26:25.017 --> 26:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have a long history in the
U.S. of having a federal floor,
and raising it from time

26:31.390 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to time. It's stalled
considerably after adjusting for
inflation in the 1980s. And I
think it's

26:38.063 --> 26:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only fair to put it back in real
terms where it was previously or
a bit above it.

26:44.470 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, risk is
obviously in the eye of the
beholder. And you say your
research

26:47.239 --> 26:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has shown that there will not be
jobs lost as a result of raising
the minimum wage even

26:50.709 --> 26:53.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to $12.

26:53.912 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how do you support that
argument? Because it seems to
make sense that if you have to

26:57.316 --> 27:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pay more, that you're going to
have to employ fewer people.

27:00.185 --> 27:03.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN KRUEGER: Well,
a couple of things.

27:03.722 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, you look around the world,
and countries that have raised
their minimum wage to around

27:08.460 --> 27:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that level have not seen job
losses. The best work most
recently has been done looking
at

27:13.232 --> 27:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.K., which has a low pay
commission, bipartisan
commission, employers, labor
groups,

27:19.104 --> 27:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
academics, which repeatedly
finds no adverse effects from
raising the minimum wage, but

27:21.707 --> 27:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a big help for low-wage workers.

27:24.710 --> 27:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at a theoretical level, the
labor market is not as
competitive as we often teach in

27:30.115 --> 27:35.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our first introductory lectures.
There are a lot of frictions in
the job market, and

27:35.087 --> 27:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what many employers find is that
with a higher minimum wage, they
have lower turnover. They

27:40.893 --> 27:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get more job applicants. They
can fill vacancies that they
have. Morale is higher.
Productivity

27:45.797 --> 27:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is higher, and that enables them
to afford the higher minimum
wage.

27:49.968 --> 27:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's the case up
to a certain level. And if the
minimum wage exceeds a certain

27:54.339 --> 27:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level, then I think you start
to find undesirable effects.

27:57.743 --> 28:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All right, Alan
Krueger, thank you very much.

28:01.880 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: My pleasure.

28:11.089 --> 28:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:17.896 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
ban on soccer headers, amid
fears of concussions; and actor

28:23.702 --> 28:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bryan Cranston on his new film
about Hollywood and communism.

28:29.041 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, journalist Paul
Salopek spent his career
covering the news overseas and

28:35.213 --> 28:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jetting around the globe, until
he realized that walking around
the world might just give

28:39.384 --> 28:42.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him the deeper insights
he was searching for.

28:42.454 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan met up
with Salopek for a stroll.

28:46.058 --> 28:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic: There is something
not in your brain, but

28:50.362 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost in your backbone, about
the rhythm of walking, this A/B,
A/B. It's the pace of

28:54.600 --> 28:57.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a heartbeat.

28:57.069 --> 29:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On a high
country cool morning, Paul
Salopek is out for a walk. But
his walk

29:03.442 --> 29:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is unlike any you or I might
take. On this morning, he is
nearing mile 4,000 of a trek

29:10.816 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that began in January 2013 in
Ethiopia's Great Rift Valley,
the wellspring of ancient
humankind.

29:17.022 --> 29:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This whole project
is about two things. It's about
the past and the future.

29:21.727 --> 29:26.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the past element is
following our first ancestors
who spread out of Africa during

29:26.098 --> 29:31.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Stone Age, so, following the
footsteps of some very old and
intrepid pioneers.

29:31.870 --> 29:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He calls this
project the Out of Eden Walk,
and he will end it some

29:36.942 --> 29:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time in six or seven years at
the very southern tip of South
America, after logging 21,000

29:44.916 --> 29:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
miles. That's about 30 million
footsteps, for those of you
counting yours every day.

29:51.156 --> 29:55.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning foreign
correspondent was used to
dropping into war

29:55.160 --> 30:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
zones and driving his way out as
fast as possible. But so far on
this trip, he's walked through

30:01.533 --> 30:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the conflict zones of
the Middle East, now on an
assignment that is his lifetime.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With support from the National
Geographic Society, the Nieman
and Knight Foundations

30:11.943 --> 30:15.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and others, he has walked
across deserts and mountains.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, why do this?

30:17.983 --> 30:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: There has got to
be a space to slow down, analyze
and absorb more meaningful

30:25.490 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information. I don't think we
need more information. I think
we need more meaning.

30:29.394 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What kind of
context are you able to get when
you are walking vs. when

30:35.067 --> 30:38.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we get there in cars
and planes and trains?

30:38.370 --> 30:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Walking has shown
me that the boundaries between
stories are permeable,

30:43.275 --> 30:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that one story bleeds into
another, because human life
bleeds into each other. And so

30:48.547 --> 30:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking between stories shows me
connections that didn't -- I
didn't used to see when I

30:51.717 --> 30:53.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would parachute in.

30:53.618 --> 30:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what are
we saying? What is humanity
telling you?

30:56.254 --> 31:00.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: The same stories
over and over again. It's the
same classic stories of
complaint,

31:00.592 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of joy, of aspiration, of hope,
of hopes dashed. And I never get
tired of them.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We caught up
with him in Southern Georgia's
Caucasus Mountains, near

31:11.970 --> 31:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Armenia, where the walk was
stopped late last fall at this
destroyed Soviet-era building.

31:17.542 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Last November, we
had just crossed the Turkish
border, and it was very bad
weather.

31:22.214 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was snowing, it was sleeting,
very cold both during the day
and at night. We came

31:27.586 --> 31:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, and with frozen feet had
to break through a frozen river,
plunging in up to our thighs.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.694 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And we were very
afraid of hypothermia.

31:35.694 --> 31:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Salopek and
three walking partners found
this "Spotlight". One man set

31:39.698 --> 31:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his gloves alight to start
a fire and stay warm.

31:43.902 --> 31:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: On a November
night a year ago, this was
heaven. This was better than a
five-star

31:48.340 --> 31:50.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hotel.

31:50.475 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Then he waited
here in Tbilisi, the capital of
Georgia, for a lot longer than

31:55.414 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he planned. He was stuck in what
he calls a
geopolitically-induced storm,
waiting for

31:59.651 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visas that would determine
the rest of his route.

32:03.221 --> 32:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A hundred thousand years ago,
the problems were different
here, in this land littered

32:06.591 --> 32:10.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with volcanic boulders
from ancient eruptions.

32:10.095 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: When our
ancestors, the first people who
walked out of Africa, passed
through

32:15.000 --> 32:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this region, their big obstacles
were glaciers and big animals
that would eat them or droughts

32:21.406 --> 32:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or famines. Today, mine is these
ethnic fault lines and these
imaginary walls, these imaginary

32:28.113 --> 32:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
glaciers called borders. And
they have knocked me sideways,
way off my intended track.

32:33.718 --> 32:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Months of
back-and-forth talks with
regional governments made it
clear

32:37.455 --> 32:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that his original plan to walk
across Iran and points east
wouldn't work.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, he set a route from
Georgia that will pass through
Azerbaijan, on to Kazakstan

32:46.731 --> 32:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

32:48.567 --> 32:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This doesn't look
like much, but this ruin on the
high plateau of Southern

32:53.505 --> 32:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgia is the beginning of
phase two of the Out of Eden
Walk. So, this is the gateway

32:59.277 --> 33:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Orient for me. From here,
I'm leaving the Caucasus, going
on the old silk roads

33:01.780 --> 33:04.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to China.

33:04.282 --> 33:09.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So at
mid-morning on October 20,
Salopek set out, with the world
revealed

33:09.688 --> 33:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before him one step after the
other, on this day up to a
mountain pass at more than 9,000

33:14.659 --> 33:16.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feet.

33:16.995 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Down the other side, Salopek and
his walking partner spent the
night in the small village

33:21.666 --> 33:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Mamishlari, a village of
ethnic Azeris from Azerbaijan.
They were taken in by the

33:27.939 --> 33:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nasibov family; 72-year-old
Ziaudoin and his 70-year-old
wife, Azmat (ph), married as
teenagers.

33:33.545 --> 33:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a tough farm life, on the
edge, really, of civilization.

33:38.283 --> 33:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: We came around the
corner of this mountain river
and here was this village

33:42.020 --> 33:44.689 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that we didn't
even know existed.

33:44.689 --> 33:48.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The first reaction was
curiosity. When I finally told
him, well, actually, I have
hiked all

33:48.426 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way from Africa, that was
the surprise moment, and there
was laughter around that

33:52.063 --> 33:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table. And there was a lively
exchange about, oh, you have got
to be crazy.

33:58.336 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ZIAUDOIN NASIBOV, Farmer
(through translator): I don't
think he is crazy. I actually
thought

34:02.540 --> 34:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was quite enlightened,
because they actually want to
walk across the world and see
what's

34:05.911 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there. You might not notice
a place, but when you walk by on
foot, you see it, and

34:09.681 --> 34:13.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appreciate it for
what it actually is.

34:13.184 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Ziaud also has
basically joined the walk
because he showed us the way.

34:19.624 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All along his
route, Salopek has been joined
by walking partners, who
function

34:24.696 --> 34:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as guides, translators and
companions. In Georgia, that
partner was Dima Bit-Suleiman.

34:31.336 --> 34:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the reaction of most of
the people you bump into when
you tell them what he's

34:33.638 --> 34:35.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing?

34:35.373 --> 34:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN, Guide: They
go like, yes, yes, yes, coming
from Africa. On walk? What

34:38.310 --> 34:39.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you mean?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:41.379 --> 34:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: That's like,
usually, they kind of don't
believe and they say, why is

34:44.950 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he doing it? What is
he trying to find out?

34:48.286 --> 34:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
when they figure out that he is
trying to go to the end of

34:50.889 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: And then it's
even worse. And then they really
ask, like, what is he

34:54.893 --> 34:55.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
searching for?

34:55.627 --> 34:56.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:56.027 --> 34:57.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

34:57.963 --> 35:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: Like, why is
he doing that? I don't think
there is an easy answer.

35:03.134 --> 35:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After passing
through boggy lowlands, where
horsemen emerged from fairy

35:06.838 --> 35:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tale fogs, Salopek arrived
at a village, Ipnari.

35:12.410 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Largely abandoned, it revealed a
much deeper history, nearby, a
Bronze Age wine store,

35:20.652 --> 35:23.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
5,000-year-old fermentation
vats sunken in the ground.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: You're talking
about the beginning of
civilization. Georgians were
already drinking.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:28.259 --> 35:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: The walk has
opened up the vista to me in
both space and time, where I can

35:34.966 --> 35:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see the connections between all
of these stories and I see how
history informs everything
that's

35:37.635 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening today.

35:42.640 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Time pools in certain valleys,
and it runs like a river through
certain canyon systems,

35:48.179 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain plains. And every step
you take could be in a different
era. And so here we are

35:53.551 --> 35:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming up to another one, and I
think that the task now is to
kind of go slowly.

35:59.457 --> 36:04.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, for now,
his steps were taking him toward
the village of Boslebi,

36:04.429 --> 36:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgia. And as the evening
gathered, Salopek explained one
mind-boggling facet of this

36:08.366 --> 36:11.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
grand experiment.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More often than not, when he
sets out each morning, he has
little idea where he will

36:15.540 --> 36:17.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sleep that night.

36:17.909 --> 36:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: We're going to
draw attention, obviously, and
just start greeting people

36:21.212 --> 36:23.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and start striking
up conversations.

36:23.782 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it is this
exact moment, first contact in a
village, that Salopek was

36:29.788 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hesitant to have us film up
close. It's hard making a first
impression with a camera crew

36:33.625 --> 36:36.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in tow.

36:36.828 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This day, five minutes after
this scene and after meeting two
other people in town, they

36:41.366 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both had a place to
stay for the night.

36:43.802 --> 36:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't plan out every step
of the way, so to speak.

36:48.173 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes, it's hard to
explain to readers who think
that I have got a team back

36:51.242 --> 36:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the States with a big map
with blinking lights and
computers plotting out my route.

36:57.816 --> 37:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would laugh if they saw how
seat-of-the-pants this is. This
is truly sort of strolling
across

37:03.288 --> 37:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, and seeing how far I
get before nightfall and then
looking for shelter. The

37:08.626 --> 37:12.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world is, by and large,
a hospitable place.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Merab (ph), this is my friend
Hari from the United States.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:16.734 --> 37:18.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hari.
Pleased to meet you.

37:18.803 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul introduced me to his host
for the night before I arrived,
Merab Saaladze, a retired

37:23.541 --> 37:26.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deputy governor of the
local municipality.

37:26.111 --> 37:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just invited him into your
home. He's a total stranger.

37:30.148 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MERAB SAALADZE, Georgia (through
translator): I asked him who he
was, and he said he was

37:33.918 --> 37:37.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the U.S., so I
immediately invited them in.

37:37.122 --> 37:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it common
to be this hospitable, to take
in a stranger?

37:41.826 --> 37:43.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MERAB SAALADZE: To me,
it was the first time.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:45.897 --> 37:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After tea and
a bit more conversation, we set
out for the next waypoint,

37:51.503 --> 37:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ancient village of Dmanisi
about six miles away, which we
will tell you more about in

37:55.039 --> 37:57.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our next story.

37:57.375 --> 38:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So, basically, there is no
shortcut. Merab said, well, yes,
you have to cross the

38:01.146 --> 38:01.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
river.

38:01.779 --> 38:02.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:02.247 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: OK.

38:05.049 --> 38:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, as we
soon found out, even the most
precise directions need
updating,

38:10.622 --> 38:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which we were given by a man
with hands stained from a
lifetime of gathering walnuts.

38:17.662 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, says Salopek,
is just part of the plan.

38:21.432 --> 38:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got GPS, you have got
maps, you have got guides. You
are still going the wrong

38:25.036 --> 38:25.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way sometimes.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes.

38:27.872 --> 38:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being found is overrated. Being
a little lost is good, because
it keeps you alert, keeps

38:33.411 --> 38:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you looking around. It keeps you
scanning the horizons about to
find your bearings,

38:36.981 --> 38:40.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you are not sleepwalking
through the world.

38:40.318 --> 38:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how many
pairs of shoes do you think you
have gone through?

38:45.156 --> 38:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This is the
fourth. Somebody brought me
these from the States, so
they're

38:49.194 --> 38:51.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of special.

38:51.796 --> 38:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you get
tired by the end of an average
day, or has your body gotten

38:56.801 --> 38:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used to this hiking pace?

38:58.203 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: I do.

38:59.938 --> 39:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It depends on my physical
condition. You know, look, the
walk has kind of turned into my

39:05.343 --> 39:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life, so it's a complicated
question to answer. It's like
you -- you have good weeks and
bad

39:09.280 --> 39:09.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

39:09.581 --> 39:10.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: I think I'm
in pretty good condition.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

39:13.785 --> 39:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: But I get tired,
and "my job" -- in quotes -- is
to write, not just really

39:18.823 --> 39:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to walk. So, at the end of the
day, it takes a special effort
to sit down and write a story.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My project, to walk across
the world for seven years.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Those stories,
dispatches from this ambling
Eden, are being followed

39:31.202 --> 39:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online by a growing group
of digital companions.

39:35.807 --> 39:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Young people in particular,
students, catch up with Salopek
along the way. The tools of

39:42.046 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the trade are the heaviest thing
he carries in his backpack: a
laptop, cameras, notebooks

39:48.186 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not more than a single
change of clothes. He stops
every 100 miles to record a
milestone,

39:54.158 --> 39:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a panoramic photo in this case
that includes an exhausted
"NewsHour" crew and a wayward

39:59.197 --> 40:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pig, then some video, and a
brief interview with the nearest
person.

40:04.335 --> 40:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one, number 29, after 2,800
air miles traveled, came outside
a truck driver's house

40:11.643 --> 40:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near a Georgian mining town. And
after a few questions and a
handshake, Salopek is again

40:16.681 --> 40:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on his way, the rhythm restored.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What makes a human want to
go over the next ridge?

40:23.721 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Ah, the eternal
question, the one that probably
doesn't have a rational

40:26.557 --> 40:29.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answer through science.

40:29.794 --> 40:35.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The walk is part of that
exploration, the impulse, not
even rational to know what's

40:35.867 --> 40:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the mountain. Why -- why
paddle into the sea? We have set
out again and again,

40:40.672 --> 40:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and nobody came back, and yet we
still set out. And one
scientist, geneticist said,
we're

40:43.708 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just crazy.

40:47.211 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that magical,
wonderful craziness is part of
the joy of this project. It's
something

40:51.649 --> 40:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that also binds us together.

40:54.085 --> 40:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Hari Sreenivasan

41:17.041 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A new initiative
designed to make soccer safer
for young players was just
announced

41:35.927 --> 41:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the U.S. Soccer Federation.
The new rule would set limits on
how much players could

41:41.265 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use their heads to physically
hit the ball. The hope is that
it would reduce the number

41:44.802 --> 41:47.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of concussions and
head injuries.

41:47.739 --> 41:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham has more on the
changes and the emerging science
behind them.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, soccer
is one of the leading causes of
concussions for young

41:55.880 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes in the U.S. It's not as
high as the concussion rate for
football, but it's close.

42:00.485 --> 42:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tens of thousands of kids get
concussions playing soccer every
year, and heading the

42:03.454 --> 42:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ball is considered
a main culprit.

42:06.758 --> 42:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under U.S. soccer's new rules,
kids under the age of 10 won't
be heading the ball at

42:10.962 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all. Kids aged 11-13 will head
the ball much less in practice.
And there will be new rules

42:15.833 --> 42:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on injury substitutions during
games. Players 14 and up will
continue heading as always.

42:21.906 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These new rules will resolve a
lawsuit brought last year
against U.S. soccer and others
by

42:25.743 --> 42:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group of parents in California
who argued the groups weren't
doing enough to protect

42:30.148 --> 42:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids from head injuries. Last
year, we reported on the rising
concern over concussions in

42:34.419 --> 42:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soccer and the push to limit
heading for young players.

42:38.689 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back then, I talked with one of
the leading scientists in the
field, Dr. Robert Cantu.

42:43.261 --> 42:47.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a neurosurgeon and
co-directs a brain study center
at Boston University. Cantu
acknowledged

42:47.899 --> 42:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the science connecting
soccer and brain injury was
limited. He's in fact called for

42:51.369 --> 42:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much more research to be done.

42:54.372 --> 42:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, even so, he's argued that
it's better to be safe and not
allow young kids to repeatedly

42:57.875 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
head the ball.

43:00.111 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ROBERT CANTU, Concussion
Legacy Foundation: If you took
heading out of soccer, it
wouldn't

43:03.414 --> 43:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be behind football in the
incidence of concussion. It
wouldn't even be in the
high-risk group.

43:07.518 --> 43:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would be in a low-risk group.

43:10.855 --> 43:14.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cantu told me
that heading the ball, as well
as the collisions and hard

43:14.258 --> 43:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
falls to the ground they often
cause, are problematic for kids,
because, unlike adult

43:18.763 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brains, kids' brains
are still developing.

43:21.833 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ROBERT CANTU: The young
brain is largely not myelinated.
Myelin is the coating of nerve

43:27.638 --> 43:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fibers that connect nerve cells.
Similar to coating on a
telephone wire, it helps
transmission

43:32.410 --> 43:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but it also gives strength.

43:35.646 --> 43:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when you violently shake
the young brain, you have a much
greater chance to disrupt

43:39.784 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nerve fibers and their
connections than you do an adult
brain.

43:44.889 --> 43:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cantu says a
kids head also sits on a much
less developed neck and torso

43:49.327 --> 43:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than an adult's does, so the
same blow might cause more
shaking to a kid's head than it

43:52.830 --> 43:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would to a grownup's.

43:54.966 --> 43:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ROBERT CANTU: So, you've got
a bobblehead doll effect with
our youngsters, so that the

43:59.904 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very minimal impact is now going
to set their brain in much more
motion than it would in

44:04.842 --> 44:07.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an adult brain with
a strong neck.

44:07.545 --> 44:11.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cantu says
strengthening a kid's neck
muscles can help, but those
soccer

44:11.916 --> 44:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helmets and headgear that you
see on the market don't really
offer much protection, so he

44:15.253 --> 44:18.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says there's only one
thing left to do.

44:18.055 --> 44:23.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ROBERT CANTU: Take the most
injurious activity for head
injury out of it, but let

44:23.694 --> 44:27.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the sport go on. And
that's playing soccer without
heading.

44:27.231 --> 44:31.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You can watch
the full report on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour. You can

44:31.602 --> 44:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also read a longer interview
with Dr. Cantu about concussions
in youth sports.

44:37.909 --> 44:49.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: The story of
a screenwriter comes to the
screen.

44:49.654 --> 44:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His name was Dalton Trumbo. And
his life and work were
intertwined with a controversial

44:53.357 --> 44:56.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
period of film history.

44:56.460 --> 45:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has a look at
Trumbo for the "NewsHour" at the
Movies.

45:00.331 --> 45:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dalton Trumbo was
one of the most successful
Hollywood screenwriters of

45:05.036 --> 45:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his generation. He was also an
activist in labor and other
causes who joined the Communist

45:13.611 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Party in the 1940s.

45:16.881 --> 45:22.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the Cold War consumed the
nation, Trumbo gained a new kind
of fame, as a member of

45:22.286 --> 45:27.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the so-called Hollywood 10,
writers, actors and others who
were brought before the
Congressional

45:27.124 --> 45:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House on Un-American Activities
Consulate and blacklisted by the
major studios.

45:35.700 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trumbo would spend almost a year
in prison, then, for nearly a
decade, could only work

45:40.838 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
using a pseudonym. One
screenplay during that time
written under the name Robert
Rich for

45:45.476 --> 45:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the film "The Brave Ones"
even earned an Oscar.

45:50.014 --> 45:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only in 1960, with his scripts
for the blockbuster films
"Spartacus" and "Exodus," was
Trumbo

45:53.718 --> 45:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able to work openly again.

45:57.188 --> 46:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bryan Cranston, who plays Trumbo
in the new film, is best known
for his role as Walter

46:01.726 --> 46:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White in the TV drama "Breaking
Bad." He and Trumbo director Jay
Roach joined me to speak

46:06.564 --> 46:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the film and the
man it was based on.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I asked Cranston what
attracted him to the script.

46:12.169 --> 46:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON, Actor: And this
was an amazing story about the
jeopardy of the First Amendment

46:16.407 --> 46:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights to an industry, the
Hollywood film industry, that
wasn't used to being scrutinized

46:24.015 --> 46:26.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

46:26.917 --> 46:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the ripple effect that the
eventual blacklist had on that
community was profound. And the

46:34.058 --> 46:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
character himself of Dalton
Trumbo was just bigger than
life, dramatic, flamboyant. He

46:41.465 --> 46:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a contrarian. He could be
very irascible. He was a pretty
hard drinker and a chain smoker.

46:47.772 --> 46:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, constantly
throughout the film.

46:49.707 --> 46:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Constantly.

46:51.876 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How did you fill
in -- you have to take this
individual, right, but fill

46:56.480 --> 46:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it in to a kind of history
that is real history.

46:59.350 --> 47:00.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAY ROACH, Director,
"Trumbo": yes.

47:00.317 --> 47:02.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How much did you
know? How much did you fill in?

47:02.853 --> 47:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY ROACH: It was more about
extracting from this incredibly
complex story, a 13-year story,

47:08.693 --> 47:11.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to distill it down to something
that was accessible.

47:11.829 --> 47:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that really -- I have to
credit our great screenwriter
who told the story about a
screenwriter.

47:16.367 --> 47:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McNamara had -- had done a
few things to make it more sort
of relatable and manageable

47:23.641 --> 47:27.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by doing a couple
composite characters.

47:27.311 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louis C.K. plays a guy who
represents two of three of the
blacklisted writers. And there

47:32.750 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are a few choices like that that
just made it a story you could
tell in two hours.

47:37.154 --> 47:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have to
dramatize it. Do you also -- you
also have responsibility to

47:39.523 --> 47:40.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the history.

47:40.958 --> 47:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY ROACH: Of course, and -- but
the main responsibility, I
think, is to get to the

47:44.695 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essence of what mattered to
these people and to the battle
itself, who they were up
against,

47:48.866 --> 47:52.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how the obstacles related,
and how they overcame them.

47:52.536 --> 47:56.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are always going to --
there's never been a -- quote,
unquote -- "historical film"
that

47:56.373 --> 48:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't have to vary from the
beat-by-beat reality of it. But
as long as you stay true

48:03.848 --> 48:08.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the essence of what the
people are up to, I think it's
-- I think it becomes very
authentic.

48:08.285 --> 48:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we did a tremendous amount
of research. We spoke to the
daughters of Trumbo. We spoke

48:13.390 --> 48:18.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Kirk Douglas. We read every
possible book and saw every
possible bit of film or radio

48:18.162 --> 48:20.464 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that we -- and
listened to radio.

48:20.464 --> 48:24.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Very complicated
character, right, I mean, larger
than life in many ways,

48:24.535 --> 48:29.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big in many ways, committed, and
yet loving a kind of life,
right?

48:29.473 --> 48:34.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRYAN CRANSTON: He was a
very idiosyncratic man.

48:34.578 --> 48:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a member of the American
Communist Party. He was very
compassionate about workers'

48:41.552 --> 48:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights. He led a lot of strikes
when he was young, especially
for himself, in a bakery

48:48.826 --> 48:57.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he was very young. And he
was very much a pro-worker
individual.

48:57.301 --> 49:04.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also loved being a
wealthy man. He was the highest
paid screenwriter in the '40s,

49:04.308 --> 49:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that tantamount to saying
the highest paid writer in the
world. And he loved that

49:07.812 --> 49:09.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

49:09.246 --> 49:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you enjoy the
contradiction of that, I mean,
as an actor?

49:11.549 --> 49:12.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Oh, as an
actor, it's juicy, yes.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:14.351 --> 49:18.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Any time -- any
time someone makes an emphatic
statement and then goes

49:18.455 --> 49:23.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against it, it's like -- it's
quite fun to play both sides of
those things.

49:23.627 --> 49:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's -- I want
the play one scene. This is you
as Dalton Trumbo and Louis

49:28.032 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
C.K., who you just mentioned,
talking about this very thing.
Right?

49:31.202 --> 49:33.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's watch that.

49:33.037 --> 49:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOUIS C.K., Actor: No, you know
what it is? I don't trust you.

49:36.207 --> 49:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Well, I would
say go on, but I'm afraid you
will.

49:39.310 --> 49:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOUIS C.K.: Look, I know what I
am. OK? I want this whole
country to be different top

49:42.580 --> 49:46.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to bottom. If I get what I want,
nobody gets their own lake.

49:46.283 --> 49:49.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Well, that would
be a very dull life, don't you
think?

49:49.119 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOUIS C.K.: Yes, for you, not
for the guys who built this. If
I'm wrong, tell me, but

49:53.357 --> 49:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever since I know you, you talk
like a radical, but you live
like a rich guy.

49:57.995 --> 50:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: That is true.

50:01.365 --> 50:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOUIS C.K.: Well, I don't know
that you're -- I don't think
you're willing to lose all

50:03.467 --> 50:06.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of this just to do
the right thing.

50:06.971 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Well, I despise
martyrdom, and I won't fight for
a lost cause. So, you're

50:13.043 --> 50:17.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right. I'm not willing to lose
it all, certainly not them.

50:17.114 --> 50:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I am willing to risk it all.
That's where the radical and the
rich guy make a perfect

50:24.622 --> 50:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combination. The radical may
fight with the purity of Jesus,
but the rich guy wins with

50:29.760 --> 50:30.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the cunning of Satan.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LOUIS C.K.: Oh.

50:32.463 --> 50:34.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN CRANSTON: What?

50:34.298 --> 50:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOUIS C.K.: Just please shut up.

50:37.768 --> 50:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This movie puts
-- well, puts the wider culture
under a microscope, right,

50:42.840 --> 50:46.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
under scrutiny, but also
Hollywood, which often doesn't
-- which doesn't come off
looking

50:46.243 --> 50:48.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all that well, for
the most part.

50:48.679 --> 50:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY ROACH: Hollywood turned
on itself in those days.

50:53.284 --> 50:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a group of people,
Hedda Hopper, Walt Disney -- Ayn
Rand came and helped them

50:59.690 --> 51:07.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, some other directors, who
felt these writers were
polluting the minds of Americans

51:07.197 --> 51:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through mainstream Hollywood
movies, even though some of
them, like Trumbo, was a war

51:11.669 --> 51:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent, had written
"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" and
"A Guy Named Joe," very
patriotic,

51:15.906 --> 51:20.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost pro-war films, were
suddenly somehow seen as
traitors because they just had
different

51:20.778 --> 51:23.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political views. That's
all it turned into.

51:23.180 --> 51:24.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: He
went to prison.

51:24.949 --> 51:27.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Mm-hmm.

51:27.151 --> 51:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He had to write
under a pseudonym. In the end,
he got the recognition. How do

51:31.155 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you end up seeing him years
later? How do you look -- how do
you see him?

51:34.591 --> 51:38.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: You know, a lot
of people will look back and say
that he's a hero. There

51:38.562 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are other people who will say,
he was no hero, he's a dirty red
commie or whatever.

51:43.233 --> 51:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I suppose the point of the
movie is that all opinions are
welcome. All opinions should

51:47.338 --> 51:50.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be heard.

51:50.274 --> 51:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think Dalton Trumbo
would look at himself as a hero.
I think he would -- he

51:54.545 --> 52:00.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was practicing self-defense. He
didn't want this fight. The
fight came to him. He was

52:00.317 --> 52:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subpoenaed to testify, under the
threat of incarceration, and
forced to let his First

52:08.826 --> 52:13.197 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Amendment rights
go by the wayside.

52:13.197 --> 52:17.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he thought that -- that the
questions themselves were
un-American. And he kept asking:

52:17.701 --> 52:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Have I committed a crime? Do
you have any evidence that I
have committed some crime?

52:21.939 --> 52:24.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would love to hear that."

52:24.174 --> 52:26.477 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But that wasn't
part of the agenda.

52:26.477 --> 52:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY ROACH: I thought, at least
as a person who didn't succumb
and who was victorious,

52:31.682 --> 52:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that he kept writing until he
embarrassed the studios, wins
two Academy Awards, writes

52:36.954 --> 52:39.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Spartacus" and "Exodus," and
suddenly helps break the
blacklist.

52:39.857 --> 52:43.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there is definitely, to me,
something heroic about that.

52:43.193 --> 52:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: And -- but along
with that was a tremendous
amount of pain and suffering.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

52:47.631 --> 52:52.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN CRANSTON: People who not
only were not able to -- were --
taken away their personal

52:52.369 --> 52:57.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedoms, sent to jail, or taken
away their ability to pursue
their own career, which

52:57.741 --> 53:01.645 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
means you cannot
support your family.

53:01.645 --> 53:07.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It put tremendous pressure on
families. Marriages broke up.
Families dissipated, loss of
homes.

53:07.317 --> 53:12.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were some suicides. Even
when you think of the ripple
effect and how far it goes,

53:12.489 --> 53:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bullying of the children
going to school, who don't
understand what's going on, but

53:17.661 --> 53:19.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're -- they know
that something is wrong.

53:19.229 --> 53:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The film is "Trumbo."

53:23.167 --> 53:28.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bryan Cranston and Jay Roach,
thank you both very much.

53:28.238 --> 53:30.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN CRANSTON: Thanks.

53:30.741 --> 53:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY ROACH: Thanks. Thanks a lot.

53:36.814 --> 53:43.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tune in later
tonight for the PBS documentary
"Debt of Honor." The film

53:43.620 --> 53:48.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tells the history of America's
war injured, beginning with
stories from the men who served

53:48.258 --> 53:52.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and were injured in the
Revolutionary War, and
continuing with veterans of the
current

53:52.429 --> 53:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conflicts in Afghanistan and
Iraq. Check your local listings
for the time.

53:56.967 --> 54:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Darrell Jones spent the
first 20 years of his career

54:02.406 --> 54:06.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
serving his country as a
sergeant in the Air Force. Now
he's in the second stage,
serving

54:06.877 --> 54:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a middle school history
teacher in Mississippi.

54:11.215 --> 54:17.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In honor of Veterans Day
tomorrow, we asked vets who
teach to share their experiences

54:17.421 --> 54:22.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in America's classrooms. You can
find those essays on our home
page. That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:22.359 --> 54:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight. I'm Gwen
Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:28.065 --> 54:31.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:31.735 --> 54:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
