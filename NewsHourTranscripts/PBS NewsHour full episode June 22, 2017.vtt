MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: Republicans
believe we have a
responsibility to act, and

00:06.166 --> 00:07.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we are.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senate
Republicans unveil
their health care bill.

We break down the most
controversial details
and political stakes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm
Judy Woodruff reporting
from Colorado at the Aspen
Institute's Spotlight

00:19.400 --> 00:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Health Conference.

00:21.433 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get reaction to the Senate
plan from one of the architects
of Obamacare, former Secretary

00:26.700 --> 00:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Health and Human
Services Kathleen Sebelius.

Care Act is important.

00:34.366 --> 00:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration, I
would suggest, has done nothing
but sabotage the act since

00:40.433 --> 00:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they came to office.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also
ahead on the "NewsHour":
Hunger plagues Venezuela.

00:46.433 --> 00:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With skyrocketing food prices
and an economy in freefall,
malnutrition hits the country's

00:52.333 --> 00:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most vulnerable citizens.

LISA SERVON, University
of Pennsylvania: What's
interesting is that even
my boss at the payday

01:06.333 --> 01:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lender said, payday is a lousy
product, but we're filling
a need that nobody else will

01:09.900 --> 01:11.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fill.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
All that and more on

01:39.800 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The battle
lines are forming tonight in the
Senate over replacing Obamacare.

02:38.166 --> 02:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican leaders released
details of their bill today,
but Democrats are rejecting it

02:41.933 --> 02:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outright, and some in the
GOP are not happy either.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

02:47.466 --> 02:49.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: It's time to act,
because Obamacare is a direct

02:51.600 --> 02:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack on the middle class, and
American families deserve better
than its failing status quo.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: After weeks
of work behind closed doors,
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

03:02.800 --> 03:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made the Senate Republican
bill public this morning.

03:06.166 --> 03:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shares some broad strokes
with the bill that House
Republicans passed in may.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would cut Medicaid
overall and impose annual
limits on spending.

03:15.233 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also repeals the individual
mandate penalty under Obamacare,
and it would end most of

03:21.433 --> 03:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the taxes that paid for
the Affordable Care Act.

03:24.033 --> 03:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill lets states
waive required coverage of
essential health benefits.

03:28.366 --> 03:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's things like mental
health and hospital care.

03:31.433 --> 03:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it blocks federal funds to
Planned Parenthood for one year
and for health plans that cover

03:37.033 --> 03:38.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most abortions.

03:38.533 --> 03:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats unanimously
oppose the measure.

03:41.466 --> 03:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer:

03:42.933 --> 03:45.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:45.033 --> 03:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Simply put, this bill
will result in higher costs,

03:48.433 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less care, and millions of
Americans will lose their
health insurance, particularly

03:54.533 --> 03:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through Medicaid.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's every bit as bad
as the House bill.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In some ways, it's even worse.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: House Speaker
Paul Ryan welcomed the Senate's
action, without getting into

04:05.466 --> 04:06.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the details.

04:06.466 --> 04:08.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:08.566 --> 04:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of
the House: I know how hard
this is to pass a bill like

04:09.100 --> 04:11.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was helpful to us, that we
didn't have Senate leadership
playing armchair quarterback

04:13.866 --> 04:15.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The last thing I want
to do is play armchair
quarterback with them.

04:17.566 --> 04:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
Senate did break with the
House on a few issues.

04:21.333 --> 04:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate bill would phase
out the expansion of Medicaid,
but more slowly than the House,

04:26.033 --> 04:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ending it by 2024.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, starting in 2025, the
Senate would cut all of Medicaid
more deeply than the House.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate plan also keeps
protections for people with
preexisting conditions, while

04:39.466 --> 04:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the House bill would
let states waive those.

04:42.533 --> 04:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Senate bill continues
Obamacare subsidies, but
limits them to a smaller
group of lower-income

04:48.733 --> 04:50.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

04:50.766 --> 04:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schumer says, taken as a
whole, the changes mean any
benefits are in name only.

04:53.566 --> 04:55.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: The Senate
Republican health care bill
is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only, this Wolf has even sharper
teeth than the House bill.

05:04.733 --> 05:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Disability
advocates and others protested
today outside Majority Leader

05:09.266 --> 05:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
McConnell's office.

05:10.866 --> 05:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Capitol Police arrested
a number of them.

05:13.533 --> 05:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican leaders argued that
opponents need to look at the
actual text before criticizing.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas:
They can read the bill.

05:20.366 --> 05:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they have objections to the
provisions, we can debate them.

05:24.266 --> 05:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what they're talking
about is a bill that doesn't
exist which they had not read.

05:27.866 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the White
House, President Trump voiced
support and stressed this is

05:31.533 --> 05:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a final draft.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
Obamacare is a disaster.

05:34.866 --> 05:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's dead, totally dead.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're putting a plan today
that's going to be negotiated.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Those
negotiations started instantly.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans can afford for just
two of their members to vote no.

05:48.833 --> 05:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, Kentucky Senator
Rand Paul and three other
Republicans said they oppose it

05:54.766 --> 05:55.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as written.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky: And
I believe the leverage on
account of four people is enough

05:59.766 --> 06:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that hopefully those who wrote
the bill would say we want some
or all of their votes, and,

06:06.566 --> 06:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therefore, we will try to make
the bill look more like a repeal
bill and less like a reiteration

06:10.833 --> 06:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Obamacare bill.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
Congressional Budget
Office says it will
have its analysis of the

06:15.466 --> 06:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill by early next week.

06:17.066 --> 06:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McConnell is pushing for a vote
two or three days after that.

06:21.333 --> 06:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa will
be back to help us analyze the
political prospects for the

06:25.866 --> 06:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate Republican health care
bill after the news summary.

06:29.366 --> 06:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news:
President Trump declared he
didn't record conversations
with FBI Director

06:34.200 --> 06:36.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
James Comey.

06:36.233 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd raised the possibility
that tapes existed after
he fired Comey last month.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, on Twitter, the president
said: "I have no idea whether
there are tapes or recordings

06:45.133 --> 06:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my conversations with James
Comey, but I didn't make, and do
not have, any such recordings."

06:52.500 --> 06:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also expressed
frustration again today
about Russia's hacking
of the presidential

06:55.200 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He stated on Twitter that the
Obama administration should have
taken action, since it was still

07:00.333 --> 07:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in office at the time.

07:02.066 --> 07:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he charged the whole thing
is a hoax pushed by Democrats.

07:06.233 --> 07:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gulf Coast states took
a thrashing today after
Tropical Storm Cindy
slogged ashore overnight

07:10.700 --> 07:12.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with heavy rain.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flooding was reported from Texas
to Florida, and Alabama Governor
Kay Ivey warned the danger

07:16.500 --> 07:17.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is not over yet.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAY IVEY (R), Alabama:
This is not just a coastal
issue, for goodness sake.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is about inland as well.

07:23.533 --> 07:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, everybody needs to have
heads up and be alert to the
rising water that can effect

07:29.600 --> 07:31.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flooding.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The storm
has now weakened to a tropical
depression, but could bring

07:34.600 --> 07:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
heavy rain all the way
to the Mid-Atlantic
region by the weekend.

07:37.700 --> 07:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Afghanistan, the Taliban set
off a powerful car bomb today
that killed at least 34 people.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened in the capital of
Helmand Province in the south.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suicide attack targeted
Afghan soldiers who were lined
up at a bank to receive their

07:51.533 --> 07:53.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
paychecks.

07:53.033 --> 07:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But officials said most of
the dead were civilians.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press
reports al-Qaida suspects
are being systematically
tortured in secret

08:00.000 --> 08:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prisons across Southern Yemen.

08:02.033 --> 08:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An AP investigation found
at least 18 sites run by the
United Arab Emirates and Yemeni

08:07.433 --> 08:09.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

08:09.366 --> 08:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said 2,000 men have
disappeared into the prisons,
where they have been beaten with

08:12.000 --> 08:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wires and roasted over fires.

08:14.633 --> 08:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. officials say they have
no knowledge of the abuses.

08:18.700 --> 08:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British officials say testing

08:23.666 --> 08:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since a London apartment
tower burned last week; 79
people died in the blaze.

08:28.133 --> 08:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prime Minister Theresa
May's office said today
that 600 buildings in
the country have similar

08:34.233 --> 08:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
siding, and all of
them need to be tested.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: Landlords have
a legal obligation to
provide safe buildings,

08:39.733 --> 08:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and where they cannot do
that, we expect alternative
accommodation to be provided.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot and will not ask
people to live in unsafe homes.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Opposition
leader Jeremy Corbyn called
for urgent checks on some 4,000

08:52.266 --> 08:54.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
buildings.

08:54.366 --> 08:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
the Interior Department
says it's taking grizzly
bears in Yellowstone

08:57.033 --> 08:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
National Park off the
endangered species list.

08:59.766 --> 09:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been protected since
1975, when there were only
136 grizzlies left around

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yellowstone.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now there are more than 700.

09:08.433 --> 09:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The change could allow
for limited hunting of the
bears outside the park.

09:13.233 --> 09:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
12 points to close at 21397.

09:17.033 --> 09:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose two points, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped one point.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
former Health and Human Services
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius

09:25.566 --> 09:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the Republican
plan to replace one of
her biggest legacies,
Obamacare; starvation in

09:32.566 --> 09:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Venezuela -- an economy in
freefall leaves the country in
dire straits; renewed outrage

09:37.833 --> 09:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over police shootings of black
Americans; and much more.

09:45.966 --> 09:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to the health
care plan released today
by Senate Republicans.

09:54.866 --> 09:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To help break down the
controversial details
and politics, our own
Lisa Desjardins, who's

09:59.566 --> 10:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just returned from Capitol
Hill, and Mary Agnes Carey
of Kaiser Health News.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mary, let's start with Medicaid.

10:05.466 --> 10:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this change what
we know Medicaid to be?

10:07.866 --> 10:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health
News: The biggest change is
how we change funding, federal

10:10.966 --> 10:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
funding for the
Medicaid program.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Right now, states can
spend what they need.

10:14.466 --> 10:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's matched on a percentage
basis, but this would shift the
Medicaid program to a capped

10:18.833 --> 10:20.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
allotment, a set
amount of money.

10:20.866 --> 10:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the thought is over
time, would that allotment rise
fast enough to meet the medical

10:25.233 --> 10:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
costs of the Medicaid
population, and, if it
doesn't, what do you do?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you reducing
payments to survivors?

10:30.966 --> 10:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you have to cut services?

10:32.266 --> 10:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you kick people
off the rolls?

10:33.833 --> 10:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's one of the biggest
concerns about this bill.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But each
one of these changes are
political considerations.

10:38.266 --> 10:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who does this lure in to
get those crucial yes votes?

10:41.466 --> 10:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, we're
really talking about those
folks who are concerned about

10:45.066 --> 10:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the debt and deficit, because
the growth of Medicaid is a
real concern for the federal

10:48.366 --> 10:49.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
budget.

10:49.366 --> 10:50.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's absolute.

10:50.366 --> 10:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And for state budget as well.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it loses some
votes potentially.

10:53.633 --> 10:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of senators,
conservative Republican
senators, whose states depend on

10:57.800 --> 11:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Medicaid, who have high
proportions of Medicaid users.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take Arizona.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How about Ohio, some of these
swing states, West Virginia.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I talked to Senator
McCain today.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he's not deciding what
he does until he speaks to
his governor to see what this

11:10.033 --> 11:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
means for the state
budget and for Medicaid.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Also Alaska.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these rural states,
it's a real risk for them if
they lose Medicaid funding.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are
there structural changes
to how Medicaid could
be changing beyond just

11:20.933 --> 11:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the expansion and how
the payments go back?

11:24.066 --> 11:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well,
in the sense of structural
requirements, you could
have work requirements,

11:29.833 --> 11:30.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for example.

11:30.966 --> 11:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governors could do that.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They could make those changes.

11:34.066 --> 11:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, this getting
back to the growth and the
payments, that is a big concern.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will it go fast enough?

11:41.466 --> 11:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will it meet the
requirements of the Medicaid
program, the spending?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Think of the
way that the Senate is doing
it as, up front, they're going

11:46.500 --> 11:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to let the expansion of Medicaid
last a little bit longer.

11:49.833 --> 11:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They ultimately would cut it,
but they will cut, in the long
run, 10 years out, the amount

11:55.733 --> 11:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Medicaid can grow by.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the short run, it's not
as tough on Medicaid as the
House bill, but in the long

12:00.500 --> 12:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
run, it ends up cutting a
lot more than the House bill.

12:02.933 --> 12:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But even with
these measures, we saw Rand Paul
today and said, well, I have

12:06.400 --> 12:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got three other
senators with me.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're not satisfied.

12:08.900 --> 12:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a real vote problem
here, because they can only lose
two senators, as we reported

12:14.033 --> 12:16.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earlier.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not just a Medicaid
problem, but it's a problem
from senators like Rand Paul

12:18.366 --> 12:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are concerned about
tax credits and subsidies.

12:20.900 --> 12:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This bill essentially keeps
the Affordable Care Act
subsidies intact structurally.

12:25.033 --> 12:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It just reduces them.

12:26.966 --> 12:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Rand Paul, he says
that's Obamacare-lite.

12:29.633 --> 12:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure how he will ever
be satisfied unless they remove
those subsidies altogether.

12:33.233 --> 12:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mary Agnes, we
have also heard a conversation
about meanness or whether

12:37.066 --> 12:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this has enough heart.

12:39.100 --> 12:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we talk about the
affordability of this,
the quality of the
coverage, how does this

12:43.233 --> 12:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill address those?

12:45.166 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well, there's
a couple things, to Lisa's
point about the subsidies.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would be linked to income,
like the Affordable Care Act,
but also like age, which was the

12:51.100 --> 12:53.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House bill.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, at the top end of the scale,
there would be a little less
generous, a little more generous

12:56.333 --> 12:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the lower end of the scale.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the other thing about
this is, what is your money
going to buy with the subsidy?

13:02.100 --> 13:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Senate bill would allow
the plans to be less generous.

13:04.733 --> 13:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the Affordable Care
Act, the sort of middle-level
plan that subsidy is based

13:08.966 --> 13:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on, would cover 70
percent of the cost.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under the Senate
discussion draft, that
would drop to 58 percent.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, would you have to pay more?

13:15.900 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
An older, perhaps a
higher-income person,
might pay more for less.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that whole benefit of
what you're getting for your
money, that is going to be a big

13:23.766 --> 13:25.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concern here.

13:25.866 --> 13:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mary, one
of the things that President
Trump has put on the table

13:27.633 --> 13:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as a non-negotiable is
preexisting conditions.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that was
very popular from Obamacare,
something a lot of people want

13:33.466 --> 13:34.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to keep.

13:34.733 --> 13:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does this bill tackle it?

13:36.566 --> 13:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Preexisting
conditions would still
have to be covered.

13:39.133 --> 13:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a state could get a
variance from the set of
essential health benefits.

13:43.133 --> 13:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are 10 things that have to
be covered, mental health care,
prescription drugs, maternity

13:47.700 --> 13:48.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

13:48.966 --> 13:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States could get a
waiver from those.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is some concern,
if a state could have plans
that didn't cover prescription

13:56.566 --> 13:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
drugs or mental health
care, what would that
mean for beneficiaries?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is concern there.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
one of the most divisive topics
on this always comes down

14:02.833 --> 14:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Planned Parenthood
funding, specifically around
the cases of abortion.

14:06.633 --> 14:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a late decision by
the Senate leadership here.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They went back and forth.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a lot of discussion
behind closed doors over this.

14:13.700 --> 14:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the end, this draft
right now would defund Planned
Parenthood, all of their federal

14:18.366 --> 14:19.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funding.

14:19.833 --> 14:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's over $500 million for
that organization for one year.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead of defunding it forever,
it would be for one year.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, that still is a
very serious political
problem, especially
for two senators, Lisa

14:29.933 --> 14:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Murkowski of Alaska and
Susan Collins of Maine.

14:32.766 --> 14:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We talked to both of them today.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They said they haven't
decided, but they are
concerned about that.

14:37.200 --> 14:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said if that remains in
the bill, and, again, there
is a lot of negotiations now,

14:41.433 --> 14:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari, if it's in the bill,
they are going to propose an
amendment to try and change

14:44.633 --> 14:46.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will be a fascinating
vote on the Senate floor.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We expect that.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Speaking of it, that's what
we need to watch right now.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's going to be a lot
of horse-trading right
now behind closed doors.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mitch McConnell
is counting on it.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This bill will change.

14:58.133 --> 15:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After it changes, then there
will be a process, we're
told, next week of amendments.

15:02.433 --> 15:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There will be a long
day with a lot of votes.

15:05.133 --> 15:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will see how
many of them pass.

15:07.366 --> 15:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really to me seems 50/50,
Hari, right now on whether this
gets through, certainly not

15:11.233 --> 15:12.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as it is now.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The question is,
how will it change?

15:14.933 --> 15:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there
are still constituents,
Mary Agnes, that are on
the sidelines saying,

15:17.633 --> 15:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
listen, covering opioid
addiction is really
important in my state,
West Virginia and Ohio.

15:22.366 --> 15:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are people that going
to be lobbying to try to
get those in the bill.

15:26.100 --> 15:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well,
that Medicaid expansion
has funded a lot of
opioid addiction treatment

15:30.400 --> 15:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Ohio, for example,
and other states.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if that goes away, how are
you going to help those folks?

15:34.800 --> 15:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we know, it's the
number-one killer for
Americans 50 and older now.

15:37.833 --> 15:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They have
put $2 billion in this bill to
help with opioids, but those

15:41.133 --> 15:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are concerned say that's
just a drop in the bucket
and not nearly enough.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

15:46.266 --> 15:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, Mary Agnes
Carey, thank you both.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There
have been many responses
to the Senate plan today,
including from former

15:53.800 --> 15:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
President Obama.

15:55.833 --> 16:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "Simply put,
if there's a chance you might
get sick, get old, or start

16:01.433 --> 16:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a family, this bill
will do you harm.

16:03.433 --> 16:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And small tweaks over the
course of the next couple weeks
cannot change the fundamental

16:08.000 --> 16:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meanness at the core
of this legislation."

16:10.800 --> 16:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now to Judy Woodruff in
Aspen, Colorado, who spoke today
with a key figure in the Obama

16:14.766 --> 16:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration about the
Republicans plan to undo much
of the Affordable Care Act.

16:19.500 --> 16:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we get
reaction to the Senate plan from
a woman instrumental in creating

16:25.233 --> 16:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

16:27.266 --> 16:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sat down today with the former
Secretary of Health and Human
Services Kathleen Sebelius.

16:33.266 --> 16:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I began by asking
her overall assessment
of the proposal.

16:35.433 --> 16:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, Former
U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary: I think it follows

16:38.633 --> 16:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the unfortunate framework
of the House bill.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People will lose coverage.

16:45.033 --> 16:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know how many until
the CBO actually scores the
bill sometime next week, but no

16:50.866 --> 16:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doubt there will be people
priced out of the marketplace.

16:54.966 --> 16:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that individual
costs will go up, which seems
really contrary to what people

17:00.900 --> 17:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are telling me they want.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want to pay
less out of pocket.

17:03.566 --> 17:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They'd like the pay
less for their premiums.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But nothing in this
bill does that.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It changes the Medicaid programs
for every state in the country.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Judy, as you know,
I'm a former governor.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I ran a Medicaid program.

17:19.633 --> 17:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid has been a 52-year-old
partnership for state and
federal governments to take

17:26.700 --> 17:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
care of the most needy
Americans, and then
was expanded in the
Affordable Care Act to

17:29.766 --> 17:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cover low-income working adults.

17:33.866 --> 17:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And there's a huge slash
in that program, again
proposed by the Senate.

17:38.733 --> 17:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It cuts Planned Parenthood
funding, which gives services
and support to millions of

17:43.533 --> 17:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women across the country.

17:45.366 --> 17:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it continues the
path that the House took.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me pick
up on the Medicaid point.

17:50.366 --> 17:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is true that the House
bill did make deep cuts,
changes in Medicaid.

17:56.833 --> 17:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Right.

17:58.933 --> 18:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What Republican
senators say they are doing
is phasing this in, that they

18:01.800 --> 18:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stretched it out over
a longer number of --
longer period of years.

18:06.133 --> 18:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It delays the effectual date
of these changes in Medicaid.

18:10.166 --> 18:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So isn't this something
of an improvement, makes
it more acceptable?

18:14.433 --> 18:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Well,
delaying the awful doesn't
make it less awful.

18:17.500 --> 18:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think having a few more
years of grace period is
probably a good thing, but they

18:24.633 --> 18:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make -- actually, in the
Senate bill, as I have read the
draft, they make deeper cuts

18:31.500 --> 18:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the underlying
Medicaid program than
the House even suggested.

18:34.666 --> 18:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that really affects every
state budget in the country.

18:38.300 --> 18:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every governor receives from the
federal government the largest
amount of federal funds through

18:44.033 --> 18:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Medicaid program.

18:46.566 --> 18:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes care of disabled
children and adults,
takes care of a lot of
poor seniors in nursing

18:52.400 --> 18:54.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
homes.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It pays for half of the births
in the country and about 40
percent of children's health

18:58.033 --> 18:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insurance.

18:59.033 --> 19:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the underlying program.

19:01.133 --> 19:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't cut that program
without really harming services
to the most vulnerable Americans

19:06.500 --> 19:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and really blowing up state
budgets across the country.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It takes longer, but
it still happens.

19:11.033 --> 19:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I think what
Republicans are arguing is that
Medicaid, as it's presently

19:15.233 --> 19:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
structured, is unsustainable,
it costs too much for the
federal government, costs too

19:18.933 --> 19:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much for the states, and they
say they're taking steps to
make sure that it's there

19:23.233 --> 19:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the longer run.

19:25.233 --> 19:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also say they're creating
this fund with tens of billions
of dollars to take care of

19:30.666 --> 19:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some coverage gaps that have
been created by these changes.

19:32.800 --> 19:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Well, again,
I think it's important to
understand these populations

19:38.400 --> 19:40.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't disappear.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the federal government has
decided they will stop paying
for vulnerable people across

19:46.733 --> 19:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America, for poor seniors
in nursing homes, for poor
pregnant women and children, for

19:53.333 --> 19:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disabled children and adults.

19:55.433 --> 19:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are capping the amount
of federal money that goes.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That doesn't change
the population.

20:01.133 --> 20:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So all it does is shift costs
to state budgets - - and a lot
of states do not have the extra

20:08.033 --> 20:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money -- to local budgets,
or to make sure that
people don't have services.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every pot of money that is
talked about to cover the gap
in services is well under what

20:20.900 --> 20:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is being paid for right now.

20:22.900 --> 20:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're here talking about
opioid treatment and the crisis
that we have across America.

20:29.366 --> 20:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is about $5.5 billion
this year being spent on mental
health services and opioids.

20:35.400 --> 20:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nowhere near that amount
is being proposed as even
a multi-year funding plan.

20:42.866 --> 20:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they take away Planned
Parenthood coverage
from pregnant women
and children, they then

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a huge gap in services.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think they're being
very honest about who gets
affected and what happens to

20:54.600 --> 20:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those folks if the money is
cut at the federal level.

20:57.133 --> 21:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's go
back to the basic complaint
the Republicans have had.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Sure.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that
this is, their complaint,
and even Democrats
acknowledge problems and

21:04.666 --> 21:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some serious problems with
the Affordable Care Act, the
cost of premiums going up, the

21:11.666 --> 21:14.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fact that many insurers
have pulled out of the
exchanges, what is it
now, dozens of countries

21:16.033 --> 21:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around the country that
only have one insurer.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are fundamental problems
that had to be addressed one
way or another, aren't they?

21:24.066 --> 21:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS:
You're absolutely right.

21:26.033 --> 21:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The coverage issues, getting
more insurers to offer coverage
across the country, needed

21:31.466 --> 21:33.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be solved.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are solutions for
that with the re-insurance
pools that have been proposed.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People want to pay less.

21:40.266 --> 21:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And less means not
only premiums, because
about 85 percent of the
people get help with

21:46.366 --> 21:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their premium coverage.

21:47.733 --> 21:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they want the pay
less out of pocket.

21:49.366 --> 21:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, none of this
bill does that.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, it would shift
more cost on to individuals.

21:55.633 --> 21:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, fixing the Affordable
Care Act is important.

21:59.800 --> 22:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration, I
would suggest, has done nothing
but sabotage the act since

22:06.733 --> 22:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they came to office, refusing
to enforce the mandate, refusing
to tell insurers they will

22:12.800 --> 22:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay the subsidies, which
has caused dropouts, and not
clarifying what the rules are.

22:18.366 --> 22:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, companies are indeed
charging higher rates.

22:20.366 --> 22:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same
time, President Trump himself
has said he believes all people

22:24.366 --> 22:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be covered
by health insurance.

22:26.066 --> 22:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said again this week,
I want to see health
coverage that has heart.

22:30.733 --> 22:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Which would
be great, but that isn't what
is proposed in either the

22:34.400 --> 22:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House bill or the Senate bill.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And both President Trump
has declared as great bills.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, I haven't -- I apologize.

22:41.266 --> 22:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I haven't seen what he
said about the Senate bill.

22:43.533 --> 22:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He applauded the House for
their terrific bill, which took
coverage away from 23 million

22:49.566 --> 22:51.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know how bad the Senate
bill is going to be, but I
can guarantee you millions of

22:54.366 --> 22:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people will lose coverage
and pay higher costs.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He
also called it mean.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS:
The House bill.

22:59.666 --> 23:00.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The House bill.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The House bill.

23:02.666 --> 23:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever happens#~ here, it looks
as if this is the beginning
of the end of Obamacare.

23:08.666 --> 23:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this bill -- right now,
there is some Senate opposition,
but they are working to

23:13.133 --> 23:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
try to get something
passed through Congress.

23:15.733 --> 23:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a huge priority
for Republicans.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this the beginning of
the end for Obamacare?

23:20.500 --> 23:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS:
It's hard to tell.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have a
different conversation
now in America, which is
a good thing, that people

23:29.233 --> 23:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now say insurance companies
shouldn't ever again be
allowed to discriminate
against individuals

23:34.200 --> 23:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with preexisting
health conditions.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That conversation wasn't
even had five years ago.

23:39.700 --> 23:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some recognition
that health care for
all is a positive step
forward and shouldn't

23:44.533 --> 23:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be just available
depending on where you
work or where you live.

23:48.666 --> 23:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a good thing.

23:50.666 --> 23:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we're actually doing
in the future, I think, is
really important, who loses and

23:55.466 --> 23:57.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who gains.

23:57.466 --> 24:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And both the House bill and
the Senate bill fall most
heavily on the sickest, oldest,

24:03.633 --> 24:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and lowest-income Americans
and shift those dollars not
into the federal treasury, but

24:08.200 --> 24:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to tax breaks for the richest.

24:10.766 --> 24:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kathleen
Sebelius, former secretary
of health and human
services, thank you very

24:13.500 --> 24:14.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

24:14.733 --> 24:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS:
Good to be with you.

24:16.366 --> 24:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune
in tomorrow, when I
talk with Stephen Ubl.

24:20.466 --> 24:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's the president
and CEO of PhRMA.

24:22.833 --> 24:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the drug industry's
largest trade group.

24:25.866 --> 24:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will have a different
take on the challenges facing
our health care system.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, there's more from Aspen
at the end of today's show,
when we will be meeting a chef

24:34.633 --> 24:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
promoting health through
good food -- Hari.

24:37.666 --> 24:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

24:39.666 --> 24:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to the crisis in Venezuela,
which takes many forms,
economic, political, social, but

24:46.266 --> 24:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps nothing is more
harmful day to day than
shortages of medicine and food.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Put simply, many Venezuelans
are starving to death.

24:53.166 --> 24:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And their government often can't
or won't do anything to help.

24:56.866 --> 25:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent Nadja

25:00.700 --> 25:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Drost and videographer
Bruno Federico report.

25:03.100 --> 25:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Images and
accounts in this story
may upset some viewers.

25:07.666 --> 25:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: An hour outside
of the capital, Caracas, traces
of a once-productive industrial

25:14.700 --> 25:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and agricultural region flank
the highway outside the town
of Yare, an abandoned factory,

25:21.600 --> 25:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a farm, deserted and
overgrown, the carcass of
a government dairy project.

25:28.666 --> 25:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These buildings, like the
economy they once helped
support, are in collapse.

25:33.500 --> 25:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Katiuska Morales' husband
can only find occasional
work as a day laborer,
and the family faces

25:40.733 --> 25:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationwide shortages of food
at runaway inflation prices.

25:45.066 --> 25:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIUSKA MORALES, Venezuela
(through translator):
Everything is expensive.

25:52.033 --> 25:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What one earns in three or four
days of work is what it costs
to buy one kilogram of rice.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Morales
can't feed her family.

25:59.233 --> 26:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIUSKA MORALES (through
translator): When the boy says,
mama, I want food, I can't find

26:05.400 --> 26:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way to tell
him there is none.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The only thing in
the family's kitchen today are
mangoes, stored in the oven

26:13.266 --> 26:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the attentive eye of
3-year-old David, who searches
amongst the bruised fruit for

26:16.200 --> 26:18.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a good one.

26:18.833 --> 26:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With its economy in freefall,
and food prices skyrocketing,
many Venezuelans are eating

26:24.566 --> 26:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
less and less every day.

26:26.700 --> 26:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One recent study found that,
in the last year, 75 percent
of Venezuelans lost an average

26:32.300 --> 26:34.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 19 pounds.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it is children who
are suffering the most,
and severe malnutrition
among them is rising

26:40.033 --> 26:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at an alarming rate.

26:42.833 --> 26:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three out of Morales' six
children have been diagnosed
with severe malnutrition.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's most worried about
her 10-month old baby.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIUSKA MORALES (through
translator): I see her small.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn't grow.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She doesn't try
crawling or walking.

26:55.100 --> 26:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel I have to be careful that
she doesn't fall to the side.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like she's faint.

27:00.633 --> 27:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Back in Caracas,
Susana Raffalli, who specializes
in food emergencies for the

27:06.633 --> 27:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Catholic charity Caritas,
has carried out a
study on malnutrition.

27:10.333 --> 27:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSANA RAFFALLI, Caritas
(through translator):
We have gone from having
8 percent of children

27:14.933 --> 27:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with severe malnutrition
in October, to 12 percent
in just four months.

27:19.666 --> 27:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When a child loses 30 to 40
percent of their weight, that's
called severe malnutrition.

27:23.866 --> 27:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is that severe?

27:28.100 --> 27:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because the child is so
skinny, it is at risk of dying.

27:32.566 --> 27:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: In a country
sitting on the biggest
oil reserves in the
world, why has it become

27:39.100 --> 27:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so difficult for so many to eat?

27:43.066 --> 27:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost entirely reliant
on oil exports, Venezuela
barely produces anything
of its own, and has

27:48.966 --> 27:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relied hugely on food imports.

27:51.700 --> 27:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with oil revenues down,
corruption and an economy in
shambles, the government hardly

27:57.900 --> 27:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has any dollars to
sell to importers.

27:59.933 --> 28:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSANA RAFFALLI (through
translator): There is at least
a 30 to 40 percent shortage in

28:04.266 --> 28:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the availability of food,
because it's not being produced,
nor is it getting imported.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know how this
void will get filled.

28:10.666 --> 28:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: To alleviate
the scarcity, the government
recently decided to loosen its

28:15.200 --> 28:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
monopoly on many food imports
to allow other importers
to bring in staples.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some shortages have eased,
but now, with triple-digit
inflation driving up
prices, few can afford

28:27.200 --> 28:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pay for even the
most basic goods.

28:31.066 --> 28:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're on our way to one of the
biggest hospitals in Caracas
to visit the pediatric unit.

28:38.066 --> 28:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But four years ago, when the
crisis started deepening, the
government banned the use of

28:42.566 --> 28:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any cameras inside hospitals.

28:44.700 --> 28:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because of that, and the fact
that the hospital and the area
around it is full of military

28:50.433 --> 28:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and government=aligned militia,
we're going to have to try
to enter unnoticed, and with

28:54.500 --> 28:56.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a hidden camera.

28:56.900 --> 29:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once inside, we follow Dr. Livia
Machado, an expert in child
nutrition, into the emergency

29:02.633 --> 29:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ward for children.

29:03.766 --> 29:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This baby's diagnosis?

29:05.366 --> 29:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Malnutrition, at
seven months old.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:09.266 --> 29:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIVIA MACHADO, Child Nutrition
Expert (through translator): She
was born six-and-a-half pounds.

29:10.233 --> 29:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now she weighs seven.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The economic conditions now
don't allow her to buy formula.

29:15.300 --> 29:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
It became more expensive,
and I couldn't afford it.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:21.466 --> 29:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIVIA MACHADO (through
translator): The most important
thing is that there's no access

29:24.300 --> 29:25.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to baby formula.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't get it in the country.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when you can, it's
at such high prices.

29:30.866 --> 29:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How much did you pay the
last time for formula?

29:33.066 --> 29:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Twenty thousand bolivars.

29:35.533 --> 29:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: That's a third
of a month's minimum wage for
three days' worth of formula.

29:43.233 --> 29:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Five of the 20 children in this
unit have severe malnutrition.

29:46.800 --> 29:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Machado worries about the
increase in cases she sees.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIVIA MACHADO (through
translator): But even
more worrisome, and
something I have never

29:55.833 --> 30:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen and that strikes me as
critical, are children who
are between half-a-year and a

30:02.700 --> 30:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year-old and they have
never even gained two
pounds in their whole life.

30:05.633 --> 30:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Like this baby.

30:06.933 --> 30:09.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:09.566 --> 30:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIVIA MACHADO (through
translator): Her condition
is very critical, from a
respiratory and metabolic

30:14.333 --> 30:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perspective, and everything
that triggered this was hunger.

30:17.333 --> 30:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: I ask how
many months old she is.

30:22.233 --> 30:23.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:23.933 --> 30:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LIVIA MACHADO (through
translator): Eleven
months, almost a year.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

weigh nine pounds.

NADJA DROST: Dr. Machado says
this baby's mother hardly
eats anything herself in order

30:34.066 --> 30:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give what she can
to her six children.

30:37.166 --> 30:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's been woefully
inadequate, and brought the
baby to a critical state.

30:41.733 --> 30:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The child has suffered
two cardiac arrests here.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She died the next day.

30:50.966 --> 30:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it's not just the
deadly malnutrition.

30:55.033 --> 31:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is little medication to
treat the many complications
that it can cause.

31:01.733 --> 31:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hospitals have less
than 5 percent of the
medications they need.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the desperation of doctors
and nurses trying to work with
broken equipment and without

31:12.733 --> 31:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lifesaving treatments
is driving them into
the streets to protest.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do they want?

31:19.966 --> 31:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Supplies for hospitals,
food, medicine, to be able
to attend to patients.

31:27.866 --> 31:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: The flow
of medicines into the
country has plummeted
after most foreign drug

31:34.666 --> 31:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies cut off ties
with Venezuela over $6
billion-plus in unpaid debts.

31:40.066 --> 31:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To ease the shortage, these
doctors and nurses are demanding
that the government open what

31:44.266 --> 31:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they call a humanitarian
channel to allow for
donations of medications.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has said
that accepting humanitarian
relief would expose Venezuela
to foreign intervention.

31:56.366 --> 32:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some organizations are
finding ways around what they
say amounts to a government ban

32:01.600 --> 32:04.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on aid.

32:04.300 --> 32:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Accion Solidaria is part
of a coalition promoting
health rights, Codevida.

32:08.600 --> 32:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its president, Francisco
Valencia, leads us to a storage
room that's been converted to

32:15.533 --> 32:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what looks like a well-organized
ad hoc pharmacy that accepts
donations of medications and

32:20.233 --> 32:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
distributes them to Venezuelans.

32:22.733 --> 32:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCISCO VALENCIA, Codevida
(through translator): Here,
all of these medications
come from abroad.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Because of the situation
here, you can't get
these medications here.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, we have
painkillers, antibiotics.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's medicine for
children as well.

32:37.166 --> 32:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The supplies
are sent by Venezuelans
and other donors from
around the world, but

32:44.000 --> 32:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in small packages, to
avoid suspicion and bypass
customs authorities.

32:47.233 --> 32:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRANCISCO VALENCIA
(through translator):
Door-to-door deliveries.

32:51.233 --> 32:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're sent privately.

32:52.533 --> 32:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Like
a courier company.

32:55.966 --> 33:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once Valencia and his colleagues
categorize the new shipments,
they announce their stockpile

33:00.700 --> 33:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over Twitter, Facebook and
on local radio stations.

33:03.700 --> 33:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their hot line number is flooded
with calls from Venezuelans
wanting to claim the medicines

33:08.333 --> 33:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCO VALENCIA (through
translator): So far, we have
been able to give medication

33:12.400 --> 33:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to over 5,000 people.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But Valencia knows
that what they provide is a
mere drop in a sea of need.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCO VALENCIA (through
translator): If you see this
here, it's not a quantity to

33:22.266 --> 33:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supply all of Venezuela.

33:24.300 --> 33:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Valencia and
others in health organizations
say the government needs to

33:28.200 --> 33:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recognize that Venezuela
is facing a humanitarian
crisis, and one that
warrants government and

33:34.733 --> 33:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
international action.

33:36.766 --> 33:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSANA RAFFALLI (through
translator): What we're asking
is that they do something and

33:43.300 --> 33:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make available the resources
that are needed here, because
it's not just Caritas that is

33:45.600 --> 33:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sounding the alarm
of what will happen.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is happening to us.

33:49.566 --> 33:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are children with
malnutrition dying in hospitals.

Solman explores why, for some
customers, the best bet might

34:16.400 --> 34:18.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not be the bank.

34:18.300 --> 34:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series
Making Sense of financial news.

34:20.833 --> 34:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOE COLEMAN, President,
RiteCheck: And this
is East 138th Street,
which in many ways is

34:25.033 --> 34:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Wall Street of the Bronx.

34:27.033 --> 34:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got a lot of
financial service providers
along the street, bodegas.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have small money remitters.

34:32.433 --> 34:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And there's a
pawn shop, not the kind of
financier you would find on the

34:35.766 --> 34:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actual Wall Street.

34:37.766 --> 34:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, hey, this is the South
Bronx, poorest congressional
district in America, where some

34:43.400 --> 34:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
40 percent of residents
live below the poverty line.

34:45.966 --> 34:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE COLEMAN: The main service
provider on the street is
RiteCheck, where we have our

34:50.533 --> 34:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
financial service center.

34:52.633 --> 34:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Joe Coleman is
president of this chain of 14
stores in the South Bronx and

34:56.533 --> 34:58.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Harlem.

34:58.566 --> 35:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will cash your checks,
pay your bills, transfer money
24 hours a day, 365 days a

35:04.900 --> 35:07.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

35:07.466 --> 35:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something like half these
customers are unbanked,
meaning they have no
bank account on purpose.

Jose Benitez is a
construction contractor.

35:14.366 --> 35:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE BENITEZ, Construction
Contractor (through translator):
Every time you go to a bank,

35:17.366 --> 35:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there's a problem.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You lose time.

35:19.866 --> 35:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The bank takes too
long to cash checks, he says.

WOMAN: Can you sign
there for me, please?

35:24.300 --> 35:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, says
cashier Jackie Morel (ph):

35:26.966 --> 35:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACKIE MOREL, Cashier:
The bank don't offer all
the services that we do.

35:30.466 --> 35:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have prepaid cards.

35:32.366 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They pay their bills,
pay their rent.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's different things that
they can do in one place.

35:37.866 --> 35:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the best
alternative is check cashers,
payday lenders, pawn shops?

35:44.333 --> 35:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe you assume what I did,
that they prey on the poor.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Suzanne Martindale is
with Consumers Union.

35:50.166 --> 35:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUZANNE MARTINDALE, Consumers
Union: Many of these products
really strip away what few

35:53.733 --> 35:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assets consumers have.

35:56.400 --> 36:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're constantly paying
a fee to cash a check, you're
losing money on the deal,

36:00.733 --> 36:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to if you
simply had an account and
were depositing checks.

36:03.733 --> 36:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yet check cashing
alone nearly doubled to $60
billion from 2000 to 2010.

36:10.533 --> 36:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why, wondered Lisa Servon?

36:12.566 --> 36:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON, University of
Pennsylvania: It didn't make
sense to me that people would

36:14.933 --> 36:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be using a service like
this in increasing numbers
if it was so bad for them.

36:19.600 --> 36:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had done work in low-income
neighborhoods for 20 years, and
I knew that people who don't

36:24.033 --> 36:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have very much money know
where every penny goes.

36:26.233 --> 36:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's when I scratched
my head and I realized there's
got to be more to the story.

36:29.966 --> 36:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To find out,
Servon worked as a cashier at
this RiteCheck for four months

36:36.333 --> 36:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then wrote a book,
"The Unbanking of America."

36:38.800 --> 36:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She returned to the window when
we visited, and was reminded
of what she'd learned: People

36:45.833 --> 36:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the edge have no savings,
and often need access to every
cent they get can their hands

36:49.800 --> 36:51.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on right away.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: One of the things
that we do here is to take
money off of people's EBT

36:55.733 --> 36:57.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cards.

36:57.233 --> 36:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's electronics benefit
transfer, what you get.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's kind of the equivalent
of welfare these days.

37:00.133 --> 37:01.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

37:01.600 --> 37:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we give you how much you
want from that, minus a $2 fee.

37:04.233 --> 37:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One day, a woman came
in and she wanted -- she
said had $10 on her card.

37:07.866 --> 37:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I ran the transaction
and I gave her $8.

37:11.900 --> 37:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after she left, I just
was scratching my head and
thinking, wow, she just paid me

37:15.766 --> 37:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
20 percent of what
was available to her.

37:17.866 --> 37:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Cashier Jackie
Morel, who taught Servon
the ropes here, explained.

37:21.500 --> 37:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: Jackie says,
well, the ATMs don't give
you $8 or $13 or $28.

37:28.066 --> 37:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They give you multiples
of $20, maybe $10, if
you're lucky, right?

37:32.466 --> 37:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, suddenly, something that
seems illogical makes sense,
because you realize that she

37:37.466 --> 37:39.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
needed that $8.

37:39.466 --> 37:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She needed every dollar that
she could get access to, and
it was worth it to her to spend

37:42.900 --> 37:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$2 in order to get it.

37:44.966 --> 37:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Time and again, working at the
window, I was able to really
see those things, sometimes

37:48.133 --> 37:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ask questions, then
really see like, oh, this
is logical, actually.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would probably do
the same thing if I
was in that situation.

37:54.566 --> 37:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Joe
Coleman goes further.

37:56.866 --> 38:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Firms like his, with regulated
maximum rates, were actually a
reform move by New York state

38:03.200 --> 38:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back in 1944, when check
cashing was a truly free market.

38:07.466 --> 38:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE COLEMAN: It was being
done in bars and restaurants.

38:10.233 --> 38:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the Wild West.

38:11.733 --> 38:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They could charge you 20,
30 percent to cash a check.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And while the fees
may seem high, says Servon,
they're completely transparent,

38:20.366 --> 38:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unlike at banks, when you
rarely know what you're paying.

38:22.533 --> 38:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: The signage that
spans the teller windows looks
exactly like what you would

38:26.833 --> 38:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see at a fast-food restaurant
like McDonald's, and it tells
you that it costs 2.03 percent

38:33.766 --> 38:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the face value of your check
to cash it, $1.50 to pay a
bill, $0.89 for a money order.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All of that
information is there.

38:40.333 --> 38:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Servon
also found that, for
those with no financial
cushion, cashing checks

38:43.666 --> 38:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here can be cheaper
than at a bank.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA SERVON: If they
have deposited that check
in the bank, it would
take three or four days

38:48.866 --> 38:50.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to clear.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they come here, they
can use that cash right away.

38:52.966 --> 38:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they won't be subject to
the kind of mistiming at a bank
that could lead to an overdraft

38:57.366 --> 38:58.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fee of $35.

38:58.866 --> 39:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Enough volume, and
even the smallest fees add up.

39:02.066 --> 39:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, RiteCheck caters
to folks that big banks
aren't much interested in.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Robert Flexer is a
RiteCheck devotee.

39:11.733 --> 39:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT FLEXER, Uses
RiteCheck: The people are
so beautiful with you.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're so beautiful
and humble and lovable.

39:17.633 --> 39:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jackie Morel
has worked behind the
counter for 14 years.

39:21.433 --> 39:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many of the people who come
in here do you know personally?

39:23.933 --> 39:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE MOREL: Eighty-five
percent that comes
here every week.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody know me in the
street and everything.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They bring me food.

39:31.566 --> 39:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They bring me
presents for my kids.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They bring me everything.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:37.200 --> 39:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, maybe there
are good reasons to use check
cashers, but surely not payday

39:42.533 --> 39:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lenders, so common
in cash-strapped
communities these days.

39:46.500 --> 39:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Servon writes that there are
more payday lenders in the U.S.
than Starbucks and McDonald's

39:52.100 --> 39:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
combined.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she herself
did a stint at one.

39:55.366 --> 39:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: Where I worked
in California, they cost $15
per $100 borrowed, which comes

39:59.300 --> 40:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out to an APR of 400
percent or 600 percent.

40:02.333 --> 40:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's APR,
annual percentage rate, because
it's 15 percent, $15 on 100.

40:06.533 --> 40:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA SERVON: Yes.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A lot of people end up
not being able to pay
the loan when it's due.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this is where
the problem comes in.

40:12.466 --> 40:14.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

40:14.433 --> 40:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you can't pay that $100
loan back in two weeks, you
basically end up taking out that

40:17.300 --> 40:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loan again and paying another
$15 for another two weeks.

40:21.066 --> 40:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, now you're
paying $30 on $100.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

40:25.833 --> 40:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you roll it over five
or six times, you're paying
way more than you borrowed.

40:28.966 --> 40:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But look,
says Joe Coleman:

40:30.633 --> 40:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOE COLEMAN: There's
nowhere to go to get a
couple hundred dollars.

40:34.466 --> 40:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The payday industry has
evolved organically to solve a
short-term, immediate problem.

40:40.666 --> 40:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I don't do the
product, by the way.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In New York -- we don't do
payday lending in New York.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you would?

40:46.633 --> 40:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE COLEMAN: Yes, I would
if I could, because it's
a reasonable product, if
you use it responsibly

40:50.900 --> 40:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the way it's designed.

40:52.866 --> 40:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not surprisingly,
Suzanne Martindale of
Consumers Union disagrees.

40:55.233 --> 40:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUZANNE MARTINDALE: The evidence
has been clear and damning
for many, many years that

40:59.933 --> 41:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the vast majority of people
that start to take out payday
loans end up in a cycle of

41:05.400 --> 41:07.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debt.

41:07.433 --> 41:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Eighty percent of
payday loans are re-borrowed
within 14 days, and almost

41:11.333 --> 41:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
90 percent are re-borrowed
within 60 days.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
In fact, Servon says:

41:16.966 --> 41:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: What's interesting
is that even my boss at the
payday lender said, payday

41:19.933 --> 41:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a lousy product, but
we're filling a need that
nobody else will fill.

41:23.333 --> 41:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But aren't
the payday lenders taking
advantage of these people?

41:27.933 --> 41:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA SERVON: It's a very hard
question to answer, the question
really being, are payday

41:31.800 --> 41:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loans helpful or harmful, or,
alternatively, is very expensive
credit better than no credit

41:37.400 --> 41:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all?

41:38.933 --> 41:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I would say that the jury
is still out on that question.

41:41.433 --> 41:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk about getting rid of
the lenders without recognizing
that the demand is still there.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the demand is still there
because we have had declining
wages since the '70s,.

41:54.633 --> 41:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Income volatility has doubled
over the past 30 years, so
people have much less ability

41:57.600 --> 42:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to predict how much money
is coming into their
household from week to week.

42:00.933 --> 42:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the less
predictable the income, says
Joe Coleman, the greater the

42:05.200 --> 42:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need for check cashing,
for payday lending even.

42:08.666 --> 42:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE COLEMAN: Voltaire said
of the supreme being that,
if he didn't exist, we'd have

42:13.133 --> 42:14.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to invent him.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the same can be
said for our industry.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we didn't exist, you
would have to invent us.

42:18.466 --> 42:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People need the service.

42:20.566 --> 42:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman reporting

42:26.166 --> 42:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the South Bronx.

42:30.500 --> 42:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to issues
of policing, race and the
law, issues in the forefront

42:42.033 --> 42:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the news once again.

42:43.933 --> 42:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our look.

42:45.933 --> 42:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning: This story includes
images of violence that
viewers may find disturbing.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERONIMO YANEZ, St. Anthony
Police Department: Hello, sir.

42:50.800 --> 42:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This week, the public
got to see the dash-cam video
of last July's fatal police

42:57.300 --> 43:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting of Philando Castile
outside St. Paul, Minnesota.

43:01.133 --> 43:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jurors had watched it several
times before acquitting
officer Jeronimo Yanez.

43:07.566 --> 43:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A conversation about a broken
taillight quickly turned tense.

43:10.433 --> 43:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILANDO CASTILE, Killed by
Police Officer: Sir, I have to
tell you, I do have a firearm

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on me.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JERONIMO YANEZ: OK.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't reach for it then.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't pull it out.

43:18.033 --> 43:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PHILANDO CASTILE: I'm
not pulling it out.

43:19.266 --> 43:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JERONIMO YANEZ:
Don't pull it out.

43:20.533 --> 43:22.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNSHOTS)

43:22.633 --> 43:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Prosecutors said
Castile, who had a permit for
the gun, was reaching for his

43:25.466 --> 43:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
driver's license.

43:27.033 --> 43:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yanez said he thought he
was reaching for his gun.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day he was acquitted,
Yanez was fired.

43:33.433 --> 43:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since 2005, 82 U.S. law
enforcement officers
have been charged with
murder or manslaughter

43:40.333 --> 43:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for on-duty shootings,
according to Bowling Green State
University criminologist Philip

43:45.333 --> 43:46.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Stinson.

43:46.733 --> 43:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, 29 have been convicted,
five of them for murder.

43:53.366 --> 43:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday, a jury found
former Milwaukee police
officer Dominique
Heaggan-Brown not guilty

43:58.033 --> 44:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of reckless homicide
for shooting Sylville
Smith last August.

44:01.700 --> 44:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In court, Smith's family
shouted and cursed.

44:06.166 --> 44:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Body-camera video
caught Heaggan-Brown's
brief chase of Smith.

44:13.233 --> 44:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heaggan-Brown's first shot
came as Smith appeared to
throw a gun over a fence.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A second shot hit
Smith in the chest.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMINIQUE HEAGGAN-BROWN,
Milwaukee Police
Department: Stop reaching!

44:21.666 --> 44:22.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stop -- move!

44:22.666 --> 44:23.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Move!

44:23.933 --> 44:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: He said he
acted in self-defense.

44:26.466 --> 44:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The shooting sparked
two nights of riots.

44:30.400 --> 44:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And police use of deadly
force is under scrutiny
again in Seattle, where
officers in shot and

44:37.766 --> 44:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed Charleena Lyles,
a 30-year-old pregnant
woman who had called
police to report a burglary

44:41.766 --> 44:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at her apartment Sunday.

44:43.800 --> 44:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had two kitchen knives
and, her family said,
mental health problems.

44:50.633 --> 44:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As protesters took to the
streets, Seattle police, who
are investigating the incident,

44:55.600 --> 44:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acknowledged the officers
had less lethal options.

44:58.266 --> 45:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why do so many -- few -- so
few trials of police officers
charged in on-duty shootings

45:05.433 --> 45:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
end in convictions?

45:07.400 --> 45:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To explore that question,
we're joined by two guests,
first, on Skype, David Klinger.

45:14.233 --> 45:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a criminologist at the
University of Missouri-Saint
Louis and a former Los Angeles

45:16.766 --> 45:18.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police officer.

45:18.800 --> 45:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here in the studio, Brittany
Packnett, a co-founder of
Campaign Zero, which is pressing

45:23.900 --> 45:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for police reform.

45:25.900 --> 45:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She served on President Barack
Obama's Police Reform Task
Force and is one of a number of

45:30.933 --> 45:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders in the Black
Lives Matter movement.

45:32.366 --> 45:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

45:33.866 --> 45:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to ask you first, the
two of you the same question.

45:36.533 --> 45:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brittany, let me start with you.

45:38.866 --> 45:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why does it -- is it seemingly
so few of these police trials,
police shooting trials end

45:44.900 --> 45:46.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in convictions?

45:46.933 --> 45:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT, Co-Founder,
Campaign Zero: It's because
this is more than an individual

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a systematic issue.

45:51.033 --> 45:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So often we hear the
conversation that it's
about bad apples and
bad actors, but, at the

45:54.566 --> 45:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the day, if this
were just about individuals,
we wouldn't see less than
1 percent of convictions

46:00.366 --> 46:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in all police shootings.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of the 1,155 people who were
killed by police in 2016, there
were only 13 charges brought,

46:08.600 --> 46:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so far we have
seen no convictions.

46:10.666 --> 46:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, this
is a systematic issue that we
have to look at, both from a

46:14.533 --> 46:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cultural perspective
and a policy one.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David
Klinger, what's you take?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KLINGER, Professor,
University of Missouri-Saint
Louis: Well, there's
really two issues.

46:20.866 --> 46:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One is the number of
charges that are levied.

46:23.166 --> 46:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then number two is the
conviction rate for those
where charges have been brought

46:27.700 --> 46:29.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

46:29.766 --> 46:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in terms of why so
few charges are brought
forth, I think, if you
take an honest look

46:33.566 --> 46:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the vast, vast majority
of officer-involved
shootings, there is no
criminal element whatsoever.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those that do lead to
criminal charges, sometimes,
there is overcharge,
and then sometimes

46:46.000 --> 46:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are situations where I
and friends of mine, others
in this profession, we scratch

46:53.166 --> 46:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our heads and don't understand
how the acquittal came about.

46:56.933 --> 47:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we always have to trust
in the jury, and that's
where we rest with this.

47:03.066 --> 47:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: David,
let my stay with you.

47:04.700 --> 47:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are the laws written
in a way that makes it
tougher for convictions?

47:11.066 --> 47:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KLINGER: Well, I think one
of the things that people have
to understand is that there's

47:15.400 --> 47:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically a federal standard
that was laid down in Graham
vs. Connor, which is a 1989

47:22.366 --> 47:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
says you have to look at it
through the eyes of a reasonable

47:26.066 --> 47:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officer on the scene.

47:28.166 --> 47:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what has happened over
the years is that most states,
that I'm aware of at least,

47:32.033 --> 47:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they basically incorporate
this standard of an objectively
reasonable officer on the scene.

47:39.066 --> 47:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then what happens is, we
have a situation where defense
attorneys explain to the jury

47:45.200 --> 47:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what a reasonable officer
at the scene could have
or should have done.

47:47.533 --> 47:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the jury has to look
at it that way typically.

47:51.266 --> 47:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's always differences
across the 50 states in terms
of their justifiable homicide

47:57.633 --> 47:59.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
statute.

47:59.633 --> 48:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that's the core
understanding across the country
about how it is that police

48:04.500 --> 48:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officers are to be judged.

48:06.533 --> 48:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, consequently, when you
have jurors who are novices
getting educated, a good defense

48:12.333 --> 48:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney makes an argument, and
the jury says, oh, that make
sense, I understand that that

48:15.700 --> 48:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer could have been fearful
or could have perceived that
his or her life was in jeopardy,

48:22.566 --> 48:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an acquittal is forthcoming,
and, as I indicated, sometimes
clearly so, and, other

48:27.600 --> 48:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times, it leaves many of us
who are in the profession
scratching our head, because we

48:30.166 --> 48:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know there's bad shootings
and we know there's bad cops.

48:32.433 --> 48:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Brittany, you
have heard the explanation
of the law from David.

48:36.566 --> 48:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your response?

48:38.033 --> 48:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your take on this?

48:39.233 --> 48:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I
would say it's twofold.

48:41.300 --> 48:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is that we actually do
have to look at the letter of
the law and the ways in which

48:44.200 --> 48:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's insufficient.

48:45.700 --> 48:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At Campaign Zero, we did a
report on the use of force.

48:48.366 --> 48:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We found the research that
there are eight policies that
both police departments and

48:52.533 --> 48:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state legislatures can take
on that will demonstrably
diminish the possibility
of police violence.

48:59.333 --> 49:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very few police departments
engage in five of --
even five of those.

49:02.666 --> 49:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it's not legal, then
it's not punishable in the court
system, so that's certainly an

49:06.333 --> 49:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
area in which we need to look.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to make
those laws stronger.

49:09.700 --> 49:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other point, though, that
we have to not be afraid the
look at is the issue of race.

49:12.866 --> 49:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, black
people in this country are
killed at a rate of three times

49:16.800 --> 49:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
higher than other
folks by police.

49:18.966 --> 49:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if blackness is seen as the
only weapon that you are armed
with, it is still considered

49:23.000 --> 49:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lethal in this country.

49:25.033 --> 49:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We continue to find that in
the number of charges and
convictions that are brought.

49:27.466 --> 49:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We continue to find
that in places like
Seattle with Charleena
Myles -- Lyles, rather.

49:31.366 --> 49:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, at the end of the day,
my blackness is not a weapon.

49:34.266 --> 49:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just my skin.

49:36.300 --> 49:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until we handle our issue of
racism in this country, we're
not going to see an issue -- an

49:39.233 --> 49:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
end to this issue.

49:41.266 --> 49:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A lot of cities
try to address that, Brittany,
very diversifying the police

49:46.666 --> 49:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force, by getting more diverse
faces on the police force.

49:49.433 --> 49:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that an answer?

49:50.866 --> 49:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I certainly
think that's part of it.

49:52.466 --> 49:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's not a single issue.

49:54.766 --> 49:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we can't have a
single answer, right?

49:57.200 --> 50:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to look at issues of
inherent bias, which, quite
frankly, especially issues of

50:01.266 --> 50:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-blackness, are not just
about white people or whether
or not you're a person of color.

50:05.666 --> 50:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also have to look at issues
of training, support, again,
use of force policies, making

50:10.566 --> 50:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure that, as a citizen, I can
walk around and feel safe in
my community by someone who

50:16.733 --> 50:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has sworn an oath to
serve and protect me.

50:18.166 --> 50:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David, Brittany
mentioned training.

50:20.200 --> 50:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Seattle case we just
heard in that tape piece,
the police acknowledged those

50:24.366 --> 50:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offers had non-lethal
options that they didn't use.

50:28.066 --> 50:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How much is this
a training issue?

50:31.233 --> 50:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID KLINGER: I think
a big piece of it.

50:34.266 --> 50:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I would argue that
the race issue is one
that gets overplayed.

50:40.166 --> 50:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what I mean by that is this.

50:42.300 --> 50:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we look at shootings that
could have been prevented, and
it goes back the training and

50:47.866 --> 50:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tactics, we can pretty
much eliminate, in my
opinion, the race piece.

50:53.900 --> 50:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for example, here in Saint
Louis, myself and Rick Rosenfeld
and two other colleagues

50:57.266 --> 51:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were able to look at the spatial
patterns of officer-involved
shootings in the city

51:03.200 --> 51:05.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Saint Louis.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at first, it clearly
looks as if race plays a role,
but once you control for the

51:08.700 --> 51:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
levels of crime across
neighborhoods, that drops out.

51:11.866 --> 51:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's one example of
why I'm not going to get on to
the issue of race being the key.

51:18.933 --> 51:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really think it has to deal
with the tactical performance
of police officers across the

51:25.866 --> 51:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
board dealing with
whites, blacks, Hispanics,
males, females, where
they don't use sound

51:27.633 --> 51:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tactics that then lead
to the shootings that we
scratch our heads over.

51:34.466 --> 51:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the issue with Seattle,
when they say they had
non-lethal options, that doesn't

51:36.733 --> 51:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
necessarily mean they
had non-lethal options
to be employed in that
situation, but rather

51:41.233 --> 51:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they had non-lethal
options with them.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so I'm not quite
sure what that means.

51:46.266 --> 51:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Seattle situation may well
have been one of those where
they could have employed a

51:50.000 --> 51:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
non-lethal option and they
didn't, or it may simply mean
that they had them with them.

51:53.966 --> 51:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we have to wait and
see what the details show.

51:56.300 --> 51:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Brittany,
you mentioned both
training and race.

51:59.266 --> 52:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you balance
those two issues?

52:01.633 --> 52:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: I
don't think that it's an
either/or proposition.

52:04.300 --> 52:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I certainly agree that there are
tactical issues, as Professor
Klinger has already said.

52:08.666 --> 52:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if race weren't an issue,
we wouldn't be being killed
at three times the rate of

52:12.333 --> 52:14.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

52:14.433 --> 52:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We did this research at
mapping police violence,
which is another project
of Campaign Zero.

52:17.166 --> 52:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from looking over three
years of data for community
violence across the 60 largest

52:24.600 --> 52:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police departments in
the country and comparing
that to rates of police
violence, there is

52:26.633 --> 52:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely no correlation
between community violence
and police violence.

52:30.100 --> 52:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, in places like Virginia
Beach, where there is a very
low incidence of community

52:33.866 --> 52:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence, there is a very high
incidence of police violence,
and everyone that Virginia

52:39.733 --> 52:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Beach killed in 2015 was black.

52:41.333 --> 52:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I refuse to ignore the
race question in this issue.

52:47.900 --> 52:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if we do ignore
race in this issue, then
we do so at our peril.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Brittany Packnett,
David Klinger, thank
you both for joining us.

52:54.366 --> 52:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sadly, I think this is an issue
we will be talking about again.

52:57.900 --> 53:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But thank you for joining us.

53:06.466 --> 53:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRITTANY PACKNETT: Thank you.

53:13.433 --> 53:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now back
to Judy in Colorado at the
Spotlight Health Conference.

53:19.300 --> 53:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Here at
the Aspen conference,
there's conversation
about ways to improve

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
health beyond hospitals,
doctors' offices,
and health clubs.

53:30.466 --> 53:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of you may recognize
Joy Crump from her time
as a contestant on the
TV show "Top Chef."

53:35.100 --> 53:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Joy Crump now runs
three farm-to-table
restaurants in Virginia.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she spoke to us
about how the food we
eat affects our health.

53:43.433 --> 53:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOY CRUMP, Restaurant
Owner: My name is Joy Crump.

53:45.633 --> 53:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have three restaurants
in Virginia, and I was on
season 12 of "Top Chef."

53:50.300 --> 53:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm here at Spotlight
Health to shine a light
on the connectivity
between food and community

53:57.566 --> 53:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and your personal health.

53:59.600 --> 54:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past decade or so,
maybe a little bit beyond that
decade, we really began to drill

54:05.966 --> 54:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down into the connection
between locality, where our
food comes from, and health.

54:11.966 --> 54:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's something that
we grew up with.

54:14.033 --> 54:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We always grew up going towards
what was closest to us, what
was most readily available, what

54:18.100 --> 54:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was in season, and
what was cheapest.

54:20.100 --> 54:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was what tasted best.

54:22.100 --> 54:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those things mattered to us.

54:24.166 --> 54:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now I think, as a
nation, we're insisting
that we understand
where things come from,

54:30.600 --> 54:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have a correlation
between our food and
our communities in which
our food is produced.

54:36.166 --> 54:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The idea that that has to be
expensive or that that is of
a quality level that everyone

54:38.133 --> 54:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shouldn't have access
to is sort of ludicrous.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's actually the opposite.

54:43.066 --> 54:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to get used to eating
the things that don't pass
the test of getting into like

54:47.333 --> 54:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Whole Foods market, but
are still ecologically
sound, locally produced,
organically farmed,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
picked by hand, traveled a
short distance to get you.

54:58.033 --> 55:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They may just have
brown spots on them.

55:00.100 --> 55:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You may just be subject to
something that's not so pretty.

55:03.133 --> 55:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can buy a beautiful bushel
of peaches in the middle of the
summer for $40 for a bushel.

55:10.033 --> 55:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I hope to share with young
people that I work with in
the restaurants and even the

55:16.233 --> 55:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
younger kids that I work with
is a respect for the journey
that food travels in order

55:18.500 --> 55:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get from where it
comes from to our forks.

55:21.233 --> 55:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to recognize that
farmers bent down and picked
things out of ground in order to

55:25.733 --> 55:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get those vegetables
on our plate.

55:27.733 --> 55:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once we do that, I think we
will become less cavalier about
how much we waste, and more

55:34.900 --> 55:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
intent on sharing
and celebrating the
food that we have.

55:38.733 --> 55:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds
like good advice to me.

55:42.066 --> 55:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's it from
Aspen for tonight.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

55:45.633 --> 55:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
it from aspen for tonight.

I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

here tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and
David Brooks to analyze

55:50.966 --> 55:52.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
