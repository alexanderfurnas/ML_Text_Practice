JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first,
we turn to Bangladesh and
the plight of the Rohingya.

00:04.466 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are an ethnic minority
group seeking refuge there,
many having been forced from

00:09.300 --> 00:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their homes in
neighboring Myanmar.

00:11.766 --> 00:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as special correspondent
Tania Rashid found,
they are hardly more
welcome in Bangladesh.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the tens of thousands, they
are stuck in a deadly limbo.

00:21.700 --> 00:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Parts of this
story may disturb some viewers.

00:25.233 --> 00:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: The island is
isolated, covered in bushes,
and underwater half of the year.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called Thenga Chor, and it
lies on the coast of Bangladesh.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a hard and long day's boat
ride from the nearest port.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This rough spot might be the
new home for the Rohingya,
a group of more than 300,000

00:45.766 --> 00:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people the U.N. calls
the most persecuted
minority in the world.

00:50.633 --> 00:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on a camp on the mainland,
Hafez, a Rohingya activist,
says that is no place they want

00:56.133 --> 00:58.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ, Activist (through
translator): If we go to
Thenga Chor, we will get sick.

01:00.966 --> 01:02.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can die.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are used to being here,
and we feel safe here.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: It's
only a relative safety.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Close to half-a-million have
fled murder and persecution
by the army of Myanmar to seek

01:12.133 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refuge in camps in
Southern Bangladesh.

01:15.300 --> 01:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Muslim Rohingya have
lived in mainly Buddhist
Myanmar for centuries,
but are viewed as illegal

01:21.466 --> 01:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ethnic Bangladeshis by
the Myanmar government.

01:24.066 --> 01:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The de facto leader of Myanmar,
Nobel peace laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, has denied a U.N.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charge of ethnic cleansing
of the Rohingya'.

01:33.533 --> 01:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the last eight months,
the numbers of Rohingya fleeing
for their lives have surged

01:37.966 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to more than 70,000.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now their lives are more
precarious than ever before.

01:44.433 --> 01:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monsoon season and a
punishing cyclone damaged
many Rohingya settlements.

01:48.900 --> 01:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Bangladeshi government
plans to resolve the Rohingya's
continued displacement by moving

01:55.133 --> 01:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
60,000 of the refugees
to this remote island.

01:58.366 --> 02:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aid agencies like the UNHCR
and Human Rights Watch have
expressed alarm over the planned

02:03.966 --> 02:05.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relocation.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our journey to the
island was difficult.

02:07.733 --> 02:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We began a week
before the cyclone.

02:10.666 --> 02:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traveled first by ferry,
then by a private boat, where a
local fishermen agreed to take

02:16.400 --> 02:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us to the island.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a dangerous journey.

02:19.766 --> 02:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pirates are known to
control these seas and
take hostages for ransom.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the island is
not easy to access.

02:26.933 --> 02:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tides are too high on
the bigger ship, so we had to
get a smaller boat to take us

02:35.600 --> 02:36.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the island.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We just made it on the island.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We managed to find a muddy
bog to land near, and get
us across to the island.

02:44.733 --> 02:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government has already
moved forward with the plan of
making the island more habitable

02:47.500 --> 02:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by planting trees.

02:49.633 --> 02:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this local official
doesn't want the Rohingyas
moving into his district.

02:53.733 --> 02:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thinks it will create more
problems for his community.

02:56.700 --> 03:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MINAZUR RAHMAN, Local
Official (through
translator): In the past,
the Rohingya were related to

03:00.700 --> 03:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the drug problem.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are linked to drugs,
linked to smuggling.

03:04.366 --> 03:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the people here, their
main livelihood is fishing.

03:07.433 --> 03:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bad character and influence
of the Rohingya people will
impact the locals here.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: But the
Bangladeshi government
believe the Rohingyas
cross the border at

03:15.066 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will, with the help of smugglers
and corrupt border guards.

03:18.733 --> 03:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government argues the
relocation will guarantee their
isolation from the rest of

03:22.800 --> 03:24.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the population.

03:24.766 --> 03:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the island is formed by
river sediment, making it
unstable, and it could be eroded

03:28.766 --> 03:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in five years' time.

03:30.766 --> 03:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Ainun Nishat is a
leading expert on climate
change in Bangladesh.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AINUN NISHAT, Climate Change
Expert: The main history of
the coastal belt of Bangladesh

03:38.033 --> 03:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is highly vulnerable to storm
surges and cyclonic weather.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Due to impact of climate change,
we believe that the frequency
of climate change may not

03:51.033 --> 03:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be increasing, but intensity
of the storm surges are
definitely going to increase.

03:55.700 --> 04:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they should be accommodated
in good concrete structure,
where at the time of emergency

04:04.200 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people should we -- can
be moved to a height
of 20 feet and above.

04:08.333 --> 04:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: Today, about
one million Rohingyas
live in apartheid-like
conditions in internment

04:15.300 --> 04:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camps in Rakhine State of
Myanmar, separated from
the Buddhist majority.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have no citizenship, and
need permission to marry or
to travel outside of their own

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
villages.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On October 9 of last year,
Rohingya militants killed
nine Myanmar police officers.

04:32.066 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Myanmar military
then led a wide and
brutal counterinsurgency
campaign in retaliation,

04:37.900 --> 04:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they killed more
than 1,000 Rohingyas,
torched homes and mosques.

04:41.800 --> 04:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Myanmar government calls
these accusations exaggerations
and denies charges of ethnic

04:46.766 --> 04:48.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cleansing.

04:48.433 --> 04:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Dil Nawaz is one of
70,000 Rohingya's who
fled to Bangladesh.

04:52.700 --> 04:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was gang-raped by soldiers,
and witnessed her husband's
murder in front of her eyes.

04:57.066 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm looking at a photo of
her husband who was hacked to
death about five months ago,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and this is a photograph
she took shortly after
she was murdered.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIL NAWAZ, Refugee (through
translator): They used a machete
on my husband in front of me

05:10.133 --> 05:11.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the road.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I saw it with my own eyes.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They chopped him into pieces
in front of me in a rice field.

05:16.766 --> 05:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, the army came and took
all the women out to the rice
fields and took several women.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Five men took turns raping them.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They took people's gold
jewelry, rings and earrings.

05:29.566 --> 05:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They killed some children.

05:31.433 --> 05:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they burned all the houses
down, followed by the mosque.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then the military went
back to a Buddhist area.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is why we
fled to Bangladesh.

05:40.733 --> 05:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TANIA RASHID: Activist
Hafez says they have
found refuge here.

05:45.133 --> 05:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ (through translator):
Bangladesh is small, and
overpopulated, but they gave us

05:48.966 --> 05:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a place to stand.

05:50.566 --> 05:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a big thing.

05:52.533 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: But like many
other Rohingya, he wants
a sense of permanence.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAFEZ (through translator):
Instead of sending us to Thenga
Chor, if the Myanmar government

06:00.733 --> 06:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could, we request that
they grant us citizenship.

06:04.133 --> 06:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: Forty-five-year
old Dilbar hopes for a
last-ditch political solution.

06:08.766 --> 06:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DILBAR, Refugee (through
translator): If the
Bangladesh government and
the Myanmar government

06:13.200 --> 06:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiate a deal and send us
back, then we will be happy.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If this doesn't happen,
then please bomb us.

06:19.966 --> 06:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We came here, left
our homes, rice.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We came here to save our lives.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we have no peace,
then it's better to die.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our children died there.

06:30.133 --> 06:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We sacrificed everything
and came here for peace.

06:33.466 --> 06:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you take us to the
island, it will be like
killing us, slaughtering us.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are like Anthony Scaramucci.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are nothing.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It won't take much to kill us.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just bomb us.

06:45.433 --> 06:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody will make a case
against you, because we have
no ground under our feet.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TANIA RASHID: Their hope, to
find that safe ground one day.

06:53.033 --> 06:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for now, they remain
in limbo, not of this land
and not pushed from it.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tania Rashid on Thenga
Chor Island, Bangladesh.
