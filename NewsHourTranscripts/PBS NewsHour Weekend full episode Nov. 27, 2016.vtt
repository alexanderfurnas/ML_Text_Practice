18:38.633 --> 18:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LEVEL THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT,

18:40.567 --> 18:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS, WHAT MOST PEOPLE MIGHT

18:43.133 --> 18:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER WHITE COLLAR JOBS.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:47.100 --> 18:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPT FOR THIS MOVE PLAY INTO

18:48.867 --> 18:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OVERALL DISCUSSION ABOUT

18:50.033 --> 18:52.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVING WAGE AND RAISING THE

18:52.467 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE WHICH HAS

18:54.233 --> 18:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO NOT BEEN CHANGED IN MANY

18:55.200 --> 18:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS?

18:55.967 --> 18:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK ARGUMENT THE

18:58.033 --> 18:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS TRYING

18:59.033 --> 19:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS

19:00.500 --> 19:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISSUE OF FORCING EMPLOYERS

19:02.267 --> 19:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EITHER PAY OVERTIME OR TO

19:05.300 --> 19:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISE THE SALARIES OF WORKERS

19:08.533 --> 19:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE MAKING JUST OVER $23,000

19:10.633 --> 19:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A YEAR TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL IN

19:13.300 --> 19:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER TO EXEMPT THEM FROM THE

19:14.733 --> 19:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERTIME RULES.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WOULD AFFECT RETAIL WORKERS

19:18.133 --> 19:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORE MANAGERS, RESTAURANT

19:20.433 --> 19:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANAGERS AND A LOT OF NONPROFITS

19:22.300 --> 19:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOO, WHERE SALARY LEVELS MIGHT

19:24.933 --> 19:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE LOWER BUT THEY MIGHT BE

19:26.500 --> 19:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRED TO WORK ODD HOURS OR

19:29.100 --> 19:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTRA HOURS.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THIS JUDGE IN TEXAS I

19:32.700 --> 19:39.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE HIS NAME IS AMOS MAZANT

19:39.567 --> 19:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
III, NEVADA'S ATTORNEY GENERALS,

19:42.233 --> 19:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

19:43.233 --> 19:46.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUING TO STOP THIS, SAID THEY

19:46.767 --> 19:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENT IT TO TEXAS BECAUSE THEY

19:48.733 --> 19:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD A FAST DOCKET.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS THE ISSUE HERE?

19:51.533 --> 19:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RULES WOULD TAKE EFFECT

19:53.633 --> 19:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECEMBER 1 AND REVERSING THAT

19:54.767 --> 19:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE DIFFICULT.

19:55.500 --> 19:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT IS ALLISON THAT A LOT

19:59.400 --> 20:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF BUSINESSES WERE ALREADY

20:00.833 --> 20:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREPARING FOR THIS TO TAKE

20:02.367 --> 20:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECEMBER 1 HAPPENS TO FALL MID

20:04.433 --> 20:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK AND MOST PAYROLL SYSTEMS AS

20:06.433 --> 20:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW CLOSE AT THE END OF THE

20:07.867 --> 20:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THERE

20:11.100 --> 20:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE PROBABLY MANY, MANY

20:12.200 --> 20:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE ALREADY

20:13.600 --> 20:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTITUTED CHANGES, THAT THEY

20:16.100 --> 20:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL EITHER HAVE TO CHOOSE TO

20:18.333 --> 20:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNWIND OR JUST KEEP IN PLACE.

20:19.867 --> 20:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THERE WERE TWO

20:21.367 --> 20:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADLINES THAT REALLY SPOKE TO

20:22.900 --> 20:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW PEOPLE WERE RECEIVING THIS

20:23.800 --> 20:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION.

20:24.733 --> 20:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE WAS FROM AN IDAHO PAPER THAT

20:26.833 --> 20:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

20:28.267 --> 20:31.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PAY RAISE YOU EXPECTED AND

20:31.467 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE BUSINESS NEWS CABLE

20:33.833 --> 20:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWS NETWORK IT SAID SMALL

20:36.467 --> 20:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES RECEIVE A REPRIEVE.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE BOTH TRUE?

20:39.100 --> 20:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK BOTH ARE TRUE, IT

20:41.033 --> 20:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTING NEWS FOR

20:41.967 --> 20:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE THAT ALL

20:45.033 --> 20:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYERS WILL CHOOSE TO UNWIND

20:47.033 --> 20:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY CHANGES THAT THEY MAY HAVE

20:49.033 --> 20:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE ARE IN A RELATIVELY

20:52.367 --> 20:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.

20:54.133 --> 20:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYERS

20:56.500 --> 20:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING INCREASING PROBLEMS

20:57.933 --> 20:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

20:59.867 --> 21:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALENTS.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, IT SENDS A VERY

21:02.933 --> 21:04.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE SIGNAL TO

21:04.367 --> 21:05.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BENEFITED

21:05.667 --> 21:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THESE CHANGES.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE ARE ALSO WORKERS WHO

21:08.600 --> 21:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITE HAVE BEEN BUMPED DOWN

21:10.400 --> 21:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM SALARIED TO HOURLY, AND

21:13.467 --> 21:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS, IF THE EMPLOYER DECIDES

21:16.100 --> 21:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, FOR THE MORALE OF THE

21:18.133 --> 21:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO

21:19.967 --> 21:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNWIND THE RULE THAT DOES GIVE

21:21.400 --> 21:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT.

21:22.267 --> 21:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
