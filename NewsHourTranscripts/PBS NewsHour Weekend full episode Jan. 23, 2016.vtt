BEIRUT.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, ANNE, WHY ARE THE UNITED

04:10.183 --> 04:11.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES AND RUSSIA SIGNALING

04:11.618 --> 04:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THEIR BEHAVIOR THAT

04:12.919 --> 04:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

04:13.720 --> 04:15.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIDENT, LET'S SAY, IN A

04:15.689 --> 04:17.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL END TO THIS?

04:17.824 --> 04:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: WELL, THERE ISN'T

04:18.625 --> 04:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC

04:19.626 --> 04:20.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, NOTHING FUNDAMENTAL HAS

04:21.962 --> 04:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED IN THE OPPOSITION-- IN

04:23.830 --> 04:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DIAMETRIC-- DIAMETRICALLY-

04:27.467 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSED POSITIONS OF THE SYRIAN

04:30.103 --> 04:32.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AND ITS SYRIAN

04:32.205 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURGENT OPPONENTS SINCE

04:35.041 --> 04:36.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENEVA II, TWO YEARS AGO.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S STILL A DISAGREEMENT

04:38.145 --> 04:39.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHETHER PRESIDENT ASSAD

04:39.980 --> 04:41.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDS TO LEAVE BEFORE A

04:41.515 --> 04:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL TRANSITION BEGINS.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN SOME

04:44.451 --> 04:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES ON THE GROUND, BUT

04:46.186 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S STILL, YOU KNOW, NO SIGN

04:48.788 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALL THE WARRING PARTIES

04:50.157 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GAIN MORE

04:51.591 --> 04:52.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH A PEACE SETTLEMENT THAN

04:52.726 --> 04:55.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN BY CONTINUING TO FIGHT.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THERE'S REASON TO

04:56.863 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT THE FIGHT WILL

04:58.064 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE AN

05:00.600 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTIRE PIECE OF THIS MULTI-SIDED

05:02.702 --> 05:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR THAT'S NOT REALLY AFFECTED

05:03.970 --> 05:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THESE PEACE TALKS BECAUSE

05:05.672 --> 05:07.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE,

05:07.707 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS NOT INVOLVED OR INVITED

05:09.910 --> 05:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:12.112 --> 05:13.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF YOUR PIECES AND FROM YOUR

05:13.380 --> 05:14.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTING THAT THE UNITED

05:14.748 --> 05:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES AND RUSSIA HAS A

05:17.050 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OF

05:19.085 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD."

05:20.620 --> 05:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE

05:21.354 --> 05:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAGREEMENT?

05:22.455 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: YOU CAN'T GET

05:23.256 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN THIS

05:25.358 --> 05:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAGREEMENT OVER TO HOW TO

05:26.960 --> 05:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFEAT ISIS.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ORDER, THE UNITED STATES HAS

05:30.463 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG SAID THE RISE OF ISIS IS

05:32.566 --> 05:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE OF BASHAR

05:35.268 --> 05:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL-ASSAD'S CRACKDOWN ON FIRST

05:37.070 --> 05:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEACEFUL THEN ARMED OPPONENTS,

05:39.539 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT THAT OPENED THE SPACE

05:42.442 --> 05:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THIS RADICALLY EXTREMIST

05:44.844 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUP TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD,

05:47.047 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEREAS RUSSIA HAS LONG SAID

05:49.849 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY BELIEVE PRETTY MUCH

05:51.418 --> 05:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OF THE FORCES FIGHTING

05:53.220 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ASSAD BY FORCE ARE

05:55.655 --> 05:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS, AS HE SAYS, AND THEY

05:58.258 --> 05:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T MAKE MUCH DISTINCTION

05:59.259 --> 06:01.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC STATE AND

06:01.428 --> 06:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER SPECTRUM OF INSURGENT

06:03.563 --> 06:05.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS THAT RANGE FROM

06:05.298 --> 06:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONALIST REBELS TO AL-NUSRA,

06:09.169 --> 06:11.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL QAEDA'S BRANCH IN SYRIA.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES USED A

06:13.306 --> 06:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANINGFUL SPECTRUM, WHEREAS

06:15.108 --> 06:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA BASICALLY SEES THEM

06:16.743 --> 06:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL AS TERRORISTS AND IS

06:17.978 --> 06:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKING THE OTHER INSURGENTS,

06:20.647 --> 06:21.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, MUCH MORE THAN IT'S

06:21.982 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKING ISIS IN ITS AIR

06:24.784 --> 06:26.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKES.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WITH A COMMON

06:28.021 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENEMY LIKE ISIS, WHY ISN'T THAT

06:30.890 --> 06:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH TO BRING ON SOME SORT OF

06:34.127 --> 06:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLABORATION?

06:35.729 --> 06:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: WELL, THIS IS A

06:36.463 --> 06:37.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT QUESTION.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE

06:38.898 --> 06:41.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTIES GOING FROM IRAN TO

06:41.268 --> 06:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT

06:43.136 --> 06:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EVEN THE AL QAEDA-LINKED

06:45.605 --> 06:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURGENTS TO OTHER INSURGENTS,

TO THE UNITED STATES, THEY ALL

06:49.943 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESS TO BE AGAINST ISIS.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT THE

06:54.514 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENMITIES BETWEEN AND AMONG THOSE

06:57.984 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS SUPPOSEDLY ARRAYED

06:59.419 --> 07:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ISIS ARE SO STRONG THAT

07:01.354 --> 07:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO UNITE

07:04.591 --> 07:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST IT.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE NEW YEAR, POLICE IN THE

DEATHS.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FREQUENCY OF THESE DEATHS

07:34.621 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WAIVER PROGRAM FOR A WHILE BUT

19:32.605 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THING THAT BROUGHT IT ALL

19:33.873 --> 19:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CLOSELY.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST MEASURE THAT CONGRESS

PROGRAM WAS A BIGGER CONCERN

19:50.156 --> 19:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:13.712 --> 20:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IF YOU'RE A DUAL NATIONAL,

20:14.947 --> 20:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
