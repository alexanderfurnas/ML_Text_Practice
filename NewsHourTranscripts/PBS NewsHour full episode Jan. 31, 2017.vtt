JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.306 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And I'm Miles
O'Brien.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.243 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, Homeland Security
Secretary: We
knew it was coming, from like,
two years ago,

00:11.945 --> 00:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when Mr. Trump first started to
run for president.

00:14.147 --> 00:19.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration rejects
reports of internal confusion
over the controversial

00:19.920 --> 00:21.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration order.

00:21.788 --> 00:26.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Also ahead this
Tuesday, we
ask a key question: Does the
temporary ban

00:26.126 --> 00:28.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make us safer?

00:28.161 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the nation
awaits Mr. Trump's
pick to fill the almost
year-long vacant seat

00:33.300 --> 00:34.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Supreme Court.

00:34.668 --> 00:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:41.642 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:44.444 --> 00:53.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is preparing
to take up the next big item on
his agenda

00:53.954 --> 00:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight: revealing his nominee
to fill the
vacancy on the U.S. Supreme
Court.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will address the nation at
8:00 p.m. Eastern
time.

01:02.062 --> 01:08.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is widely reported that two
federal appeals
court judges, Neil Gorsuch and
Thomas Hardiman,

01:08.702 --> 01:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
top the list of candidates.

01:10.570 --> 01:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement comes amid the
uproar over
Mr. Trump's immigration
moratorium, and a

01:15.575 --> 01:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high-level ouster at the Justice
Department.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A night of political
drama at the
White House gave way to a day of
defending

01:25.519 --> 01:27.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Trump's actions.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer:

01:29.156 --> 01:31.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
For the attorney general to turn
around and

01:31.158 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, I'm not going to uphold
this lawful executive
order, is clearly a dereliction
of duty.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she should've been removed,
and she was.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Acting Attorney
General Sally Yates,
an Obama appointee, was fired
after directing

01:45.005 --> 01:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Department lawyers not
to defend the
president's immigration order.

01:49.509 --> 01:54.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"At present," she wrote them, "I
am not convinced
that the defense of the
executive order is

01:54.481 --> 02:00.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
consistent with my
responsibilities, nor am
I convinced that the executive
order is lawful."

02:00.554 --> 02:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer insisted Justice's Office
of Legal
Counsel did find the order
lawful.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: That doesn't sound
like an attorney
general that is upholding the
duty that she

02:08.996 --> 02:10.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
swore to uphold.

02:10.897 --> 02:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the end of the day, the
attorney general
either had a problem with her
own division

02:15.702 --> 02:18.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approving something, but it
wasn't the president
she had a problem with.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president followed the
process.

02:20.640 --> 02:26.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, Homeland
Security Secretary
John Kelly dismissed reports
that he was kept

02:26.480 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the dark about the
immigration order.

02:28.348 --> 02:31.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, Homeland Security
Secretary: I
knew this was under development,
and I think

02:31.351 --> 02:35.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were in pretty good shape in
how it was
implemented by the work force.

02:35.956 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The New York Times
had reported
Kelly wasn't fully briefed until
the order

02:39.960 --> 02:45.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was being signed on Friday, and
that Defense
Secretary James Mattis wasn't
consulted until

02:45.332 --> 02:47.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just hours earlier.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: From day one, in
terms of the
inauguration, finishing touches,
I would have

02:51.805 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put it that way, were being
put on the
executive order.

02:54.041 --> 03:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I say, high-level folks in
the government,
attorneys as well, were part of
that.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People on my staff were
generally involved.

03:02.716 --> 03:07.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: But the acting
commissioner of
customs and border protection,
Kevin McAleenan,

03:07.788 --> 03:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conceded today the order's
implementation
could have been better.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN MCALEENAN, Acting
Commissioner of Customs
and Border Protection:
Communications, publicly

03:12.893 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and interagency, haven't been
the best in
the initial rollout of this
process.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have communicated with the
Department of
State now.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, these guidelines will be
on our Web
site.

03:20.867 --> 03:26.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: McAleenan said his
agency had to
create a waiver process for
holders of green

03:26.173 --> 03:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
card and special visas after the
order took
effect.

03:29.342 --> 03:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Capitol, House Speaker
Paul Ryan said
top Republicans weren't briefed
on the executive

03:34.681 --> 03:36.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
order was being signed.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
think it's regrettable that
there was some

03:39.152 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confusion on the rollout of
this.

03:41.088 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one wanted to see people with
green cards
or special immigration visas
like translators

03:45.725 --> 03:47.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get caught up in all of this.

03:47.594 --> 03:51.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Press Secretary
Spicer dismissed
reports that the White House
handling of the

03:51.198 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration order had created
tensions with
congressional Republicans.

03:54.801 --> 03:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Throughout it all, Mr. Trump
spent most of
his day in meetings.

03:59.873 --> 04:05.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This morning, he urged
executives from major
pharmaceutical companies to cut
prices.

04:05.445 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the White House also said
the president
will continue President Obama's
order barring

04:10.750 --> 04:16.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
discrimination by federal
employers and contractors
based on sexual orientation and
gender identity.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

04:20.494 --> 04:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also faces another
legal challenge tonight.

04:24.764 --> 04:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Francisco has filed suit
against his order
on so-called sanctuary cities.

04:29.870 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It cuts off federal aid to
cities that shelter
undocumented immigrants.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the day's
other news: Senate
Democrats forced delays on three
of the president's

04:38.612 --> 04:40.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cabinet nominees.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Judiciary Committee had
planned to vote
on Republican Senator Jeff
Sessions to be

04:44.784 --> 04:46.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attorney general.

04:46.686 --> 04:50.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the committee meeting
grew contentious
in the wake of last night's
firing of the

04:51.091 --> 04:51.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acting attorney general.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: We clearly
saw what a truly independent
attorney general

04:57.731 --> 04:58.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

04:58.999 --> 05:03.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I have no confidence that
Senator Sessions
will do that.

05:03.403 --> 05:11.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, he has been the
fiercest, most dedicated,
and most loyal promoter in
Congress of the

05:11.545 --> 05:12.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump agenda.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
Everyone on this
committee, be they Republican or
Democrat,

05:17.050 --> 05:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows Senator Sessions to be a
man of integrity
and a man of his word.

05:24.391 --> 05:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because we know him to be a man
of his word,
we know that he will uphold and
enforce all

05:31.531 --> 05:34.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
laws equally.

05:34.534 --> 05:38.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Democrats on the
Finance Committee blocked action
on the nominee

05:38.505 --> 05:44.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Mnuchin to be treasury
secretary and
Tom Price for Health and Human
Services.

05:44.411 --> 05:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nominee for secretary of
education, Betsy
DeVos, squeaked through the
Senate Education

05:50.050 --> 05:50.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was 12 to 11, down party
lines.

05:53.386 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But two Republicans, Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska
and Susan Collins of Maine,
warned that they

05:59.559 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still have serious concerns.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:03.563 --> 06:08.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I was
surprised
and concerned about Mrs. DeVos'
apparent lack

06:09.069 --> 06:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of familiarity with the landmark
1975 law
IDEA that guarantees a free and
appropriate

06:20.480 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education for children with
special needs.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MURKOWSKI (R), Alaska: When
each of us
have the opportunity to vote aye
or nay on

06:29.489 --> 06:33.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the floor, I wouldn't advise
that she yet
count on my vote.

06:33.827 --> 06:38.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Three more
Cabinet nominees
advanced to the full Senate
today for confirmation

06:38.131 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
votes.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Energy Committee approved
Montana Congressman
Ryan Zinke as interior
secretary, and former

06:44.070 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Texas Governor Rick Perry as
energy secretary.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Small Business Committee
endorsed
Linda McMahon to run the Small
Business Administration.

06:52.279 --> 06:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Elaine Chao was sworn
in as transportation
secretary, shortly after being
confirmed by

06:58.151 --> 06:59.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our Lisa
Desjardins has spent
much of the day at the Capitol,
watching the

07:03.323 --> 07:06.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to-and-fro over President
Trump's Cabinet
choices.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she joins me now.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa, welcome.

07:09.963 --> 07:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what is the strategy behind
the Democrats'
tactics in slowing down,
delaying these nominations?

07:14.367 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD+IT-MD-IT-LISA DESJARDINS:
The truth
is, it depends on each
committee.

07:16.970 --> 07:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you reported earlier, it
seems the ones
who are the most indefinitely
delayed are

07:21.374 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treasury secretary nominee Steve
Mnuchin and
also HHS nominee Tom Price.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know when they will
come up for a
vote.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats say they want to talk
to them again.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want more answers to
questions.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's in limbo right now.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, attorney
general nominee
Jeff Sessions looks like he will
get a vote

07:38.825 --> 07:39.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tomorrow.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But all this delay in the end
might not matter.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really things like you
report on, on
Betsy DeVos.

07:43.596 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they have enough Republican
votes to be
confirmed?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which we're
watching.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So how are the Republicans
responding to this?

07:49.669 --> 07:50.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that this is bad acting
on the part
of Democrats.

07:54.107 --> 07:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say this is Democrats being
sore losers,
in the word of one Republican.

07:58.778 --> 08:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the other hand, Democrats
say they
are playing hardball, and that
they are reacting

08:02.949 --> 08:05.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to President Trump's refugee
order.

08:05.552 --> 08:10.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say that he is now
unleashing a new kind
of aggressive executive power
that they are

08:10.890 --> 08:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reacting to in the Senate.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, how
are the Republicans
dealing with that?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And does it have implications
for the Supreme
Court nominee coming?

08:19.232 --> 08:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I didn't get a
lot of answers
from Republicans tonight as to
how can they

08:22.602 --> 08:26.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get these nominees to the Senate
floor without
going through some of these
committees?

08:26.573 --> 08:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they're working on it,
but the truth
is, I don't know of a way they
can do it without

08:30.243 --> 08:31.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democratic votes.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's to be determined.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, in the end, it's a
political
calculus on both sides, and the
Supreme Court

08:38.618 --> 08:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee will be a huge factor in
this.

08:41.821 --> 08:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are, in a way,
daring Democrats
to try and block the Supreme
Court nominee.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats seem to be ready to do
it.

08:47.994 --> 08:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will see if Republicans, as
John McCain
told me tonight, are willing to
change the

08:52.599 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote count to only 50 votes for
a Supreme
Court nominee.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say they're open to that at
this point.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huh.

08:59.172 --> 09:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that would be a story for
all of us
to cover.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
thank you.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: In Eastern
Ukraine, heavy new
fighting has erupted, with at
least eight

09:10.049 --> 09:12.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people killed overnight.

09:12.185 --> 09:16.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ukrainian troops and
Russian-backed rebels
dueled with artillery and
rockets on the outskirts

09:16.890 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Donetsk.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It appears to be the worst
shelling in many
months, and it briefly trapped
hundreds of

09:22.796 --> 09:24.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coal miners underground.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ukraine's president blamed
Moscow.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETRO POROSHENKO, Ukrainian
President (through
translator): Our servicemen are
successfully

09:30.770 --> 09:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defending their positions.

09:32.672 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only restriction is when
criminals, Russian
rebels, deploy artillery
systems, tanks and

09:36.576 --> 09:39.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
multiple missile rocket
launchers in residential
areas.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have clear evidence of that.

09:41.448 --> 09:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Ukrainian
military and
Russian-backed rebels each blame
the other

09:44.851 --> 09:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for launching the offensive.

09:46.786 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the Boy
Scouts of America now says that
it will accept

09:51.524 --> 09:55.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transgender children who
identify as boys.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement last night, the
organization
said its existing approach is --
quote -- "no

09:59.766 --> 10:05.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
longer sufficient," as
communities and state
laws are interpreting gender
identity differently.

10:05.738 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Girl Scouts organization has
accepted
transgender members for years.

10:10.176 --> 10:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tonight marks the
deadline
for Americans to sign up for
health insurance

10:14.113 --> 10:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the Affordable Care Act.

10:15.982 --> 10:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It affects 39 states served by
healthcare.gov.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States with their own insurance
Web sites
set their own deadlines.

10:24.123 --> 10:28.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump and
congressional Republicans
have promised to repeal and
replace Obamacare.

10:28.862 --> 10:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on Wall
Street today, subpar
earnings from Goldman Sachs,
Boeing and others

10:34.000 --> 10:35.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weighed on stocks.

10:35.568 --> 10:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 107
points to close at 19864.

10:42.008 --> 10:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a point, but the
S&amp;P 500 slipped
two.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
the contenders for President
Trump's Supreme

10:49.949 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court nominee; universities warn
international
students not to leave the
country; and a music

10:56.723 --> 11:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
job that women rarely hold.

11:02.929 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Many questions
remain about
President Trump's executive
order temporarily

11:15.675 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prohibiting citizens of seven
majority Muslim
countries from entering the U.S.
Perhaps chief

11:21.781 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among these questions: Does it
make us any
safer?

11:24.984 --> 11:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both today and yesterday, White
House Press
Secretary Sean Spicer fielded
queries from

11:30.957 --> 11:32.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reporters.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Some of the countries
that have
problems with terrorism are not
on the list.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
Right, and we're reviewing the
entire process

11:38.431 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over this period of time to make
sure that
we do this right.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think you have to
look any further
than the families of the Boston
Marathon in

11:46.406 --> 11:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atlanta, in San Bernardino, to
ask if we can
go further.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's obviously steps that we
can and should
be taking, and I think the
president is going

11:53.379 --> 11:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to continue do to what he can to
make sure
that this country is as safe as
possible.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: There are some people
obviously
critical of the fact that you
have countries

12:00.386 --> 12:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, for example, mentioned,
Saudi Arabia
or Afghanistan, where we have
had attacks

12:03.957 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on U.S. soil with connections to
those countries.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, do you foresee those being
added?

12:08.061 --> 12:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: So, are you asking,
what is our
concern with their reaction to
us?

12:11.798 --> 12:12.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Absolutely.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SEAN SPICER: Yes.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think the president's
number one goal
is the protection and safety of
the United

12:17.670 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States and its people.

12:19.606 --> 12:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they want to act in a way
that's inconsistent
with their concerns, then that's
up to them

12:23.643 --> 12:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do it as a sovereign nation.

12:25.478 --> 12:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is our duty and it is his
duty to make
sure that this country and its
people are

12:29.248 --> 12:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protected first and foremost.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can't be a ban if you're
letting a million
people in.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If 325,000 people from another
country can't
come in, that is by nature not a
ban.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is extreme vetting.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is this
policy effective?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does it make U.S. citizens
safer?

12:45.398 --> 12:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one perspective, I am joined
now by Michael
Leiter.

12:48.201 --> 12:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the director of the
National Counterterrorism
Center from 2007 to 2011, during
both the

12:54.707 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
George W. Bush and Obama
administrations.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Leiter, welcome back to
the program.

12:59.912 --> 13:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's your general reaction to
what Sean
Spicer is saying is the White
House rationale

13:04.117 --> 13:05.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for this?

13:05.818 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER, Former Director,
National
Counterterrorism Center: Well, I
think, as

13:07.654 --> 13:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a general matter, it misses the
point that
much of this vetting is already
going on.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the question is, why stop
it now?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we going to add?

13:15.261 --> 13:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the goal is to have a
zero-defect system,
that no one will ever come to
the U.S. who

13:20.199 --> 13:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later poses a danger to U.S.
citizens, then
there's really only one way to
accomplish

13:25.171 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, and that is to permanently
shut down
all immigration.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the fact is, we can't do
that.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We wouldn't do that.

13:32.245 --> 13:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to make smart judgments
based on facts
about how we vet people, where
we vet people,

13:37.383 --> 13:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and where the threat really
comes from.

13:39.252 --> 13:43.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, based on all of those
things, I really
don't see this right now as
being an effective

13:43.690 --> 13:45.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counterterrorism tool.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
referring, among
other things, to the fact that a
number of

13:47.927 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrorist incidents that
have taken place
in this country, a number of
them were on

13:52.665 --> 13:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the part of people who had been
living here
for a number of years.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: That's right.

13:57.303 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2001, 82 percent of fatal
attacks in
the United States from Sunni
extremist terrorism,

14:02.875 --> 14:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violent Islamic extremists, have
been legal
permanent residents or citizens.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the others weren't from
these seven countries.

14:09.782 --> 14:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by shutting down, at least
temporarily,
immigration from these
countries, it's a little

14:14.120 --> 14:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit like closing the barn door,
but it's not
even the barn door where the
horse came from.

14:18.725 --> 14:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael, when
the White
House is asked why these seven
countries,

14:22.862 --> 14:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say, well, these were
countries that
were identified by President
Obama.

14:26.666 --> 14:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is when -- at a time
when you were
in office -- they're saying
2011.

14:31.904 --> 14:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were identified at that
time as being
countries of concern.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the difference between
what happened
under President Obama and what
they're doing

14:39.746 --> 14:40.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

14:40.913 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Well, there is
some truth
there.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These seven countries do
represent countries
where there's a serious
terrorism threat.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this -- these countries
really grew out
of the Paris attacks.

14:49.856 --> 14:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that issue involved people
from European
countries who didn't need a
visa, immigration

14:55.962 --> 14:57.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
visa at all.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were from visa waiver
countries who could
just travel to the U.S.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And under the Obama
administration, if people,
say, from the United Kingdom
traveled to Yemen,

15:05.004 --> 15:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then they would have to apply
for a visa.

15:07.373 --> 15:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What this order did was import
those countries
to which people were traveling
and saying

15:11.878 --> 15:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyone traveling from those
countries, there's
going to be a pause.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think there's some
correlation, but it's
really using it for a very, very
different

15:19.318 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
purpose.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it misses, again, what the
greatest threat
was, which is people coming from
visa waiver

15:25.024 --> 15:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries where the reviews are
much less.

15:27.093 --> 15:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, visa
waiver countries
being countries we normally
think of as friendly,

15:31.130 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our allies, in Europe, other
parts of the
world, where there is a
government not viewed

15:36.002 --> 15:36.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a threat.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: That's exactly
right.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are really three ways to
get into the
United States, a visa waiver
country, the

15:41.007 --> 15:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.K., Germany, France, where we
have very
close ties and share
information.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't have to apply.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't get interviewed.

15:48.114 --> 15:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Visa countries, like these
seven, where people
are already being vetted, quite
extremely,

15:52.251 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then refugees, which really
fall into
a special category and who get
special attention.

15:57.490 --> 16:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when they say
these are
all designed to make the United
States safer,

16:02.261 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make American citizens safer,
the answer
is?

16:05.531 --> 16:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: I think the
answer on these
countries is, I don't see it.

16:09.869 --> 16:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to remember the ways
in which
this alienates the people with
whom we have

16:14.607 --> 16:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to partner, domestically and
internationally.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the Muslim community in the
U.S., which
helps us identify terrorists and
radicalized

16:20.313 --> 16:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals and stop them.

16:22.248 --> 16:26.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, critically, it's the
international partners
that we need help from in the
Middle East

16:26.619 --> 16:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in majority Muslim nations
who I fear
will be alienated by some of
these steps.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned the
vetting process
that already takes place, that
was taking

16:35.161 --> 16:38.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place through the Obama
administration.

16:38.130 --> 16:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was reading a piece just today
or yesterday
citing at least 20 different
steps that someone

16:43.836 --> 16:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to take if they want to
enter the United
States from one of these
countries considered

16:47.073 --> 16:48.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suspect.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How would you go about
tightening -- just
how tight is that process?

16:52.211 --> 16:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how would you go about
tightening it,
making it more -- stricter?

16:54.747 --> 16:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Well, it's hard
to figure
out, quite honestly, Judy.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's in part because it
has been constantly
improved.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was good in 2001, after 9/11.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't perfect.

17:06.392 --> 17:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after 2011 and the underwear
bomber, the
Christmas Day bomber, it was
tightened more.

17:10.897 --> 17:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, every individual who
is applying
for a visa, they go through
biographical checks

17:16.435 --> 17:20.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from all of the national
security agencies,
the FBI, DHS and CIA.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have biometric checks,
fingerprints.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're finally interviewed
before they
even get that visa.

17:25.945 --> 17:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they undergo additional
screening
while they're traveling.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it is pretty severe.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the cases of refugees
coming out of
Syria, it is even more severe.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have already been
screened by the
U.N. before handed over to the
U.S.

17:38.858 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in those cases, we're
generally not talking
about what would be known in our
circles as

17:44.363 --> 17:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military-age males, the ones
you're most concerned
with becoming terrorists.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of Syrian refugees,
that's less
than 2 percent of the
population.

17:51.437 --> 17:56.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other
argument I have heard
the administration make is that
these individuals

17:56.609 --> 18:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from places where they
can't -- the U.S.
can't believe what their
government says about

18:03.482 --> 18:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether they -- about their
background, that
it's either a chaotic situation,
disorganized

18:08.154 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
situation, or a government that
the U.S. would
have no reason to trust.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: There's no doubt
that some
cases like Syria make it more
difficult.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the one you just
repeated was
really exaggerating how hard it
is.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We still have lots of databases.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have lots of information.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know e-mail addresses.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know phone numbers.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And searching those against the
wealth of
collection that the U.S.
intelligence community

18:29.976 --> 18:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has can make connections that
are important.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Further steps that have been
improved over
the past several years involve
looking at

18:35.848 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people's social media profile.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really important to
understand.

18:39.919 --> 18:43.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We do have to demand that
countries from which
these people are coming are
cooperating with

18:43.456 --> 18:44.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That should be part of the visa
process.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that's an important
step, that
we demand from these countries
that they provide

18:50.062 --> 18:51.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with us information.

18:51.931 --> 18:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea that we simply
can't get data
about these people, I think,
misunderstands

18:56.435 --> 19:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the intelligence community
and the vetting
system has worked since 9/11.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Leiter,
thank you very
much.

19:03.943 --> 19:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Great to be
here, Judy.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

19:14.186 --> 19:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Aside from the
national security
concerns, the president's
executive order

19:19.258 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has ignited a fierce debate on
its legality
and constitutionality.

19:23.863 --> 19:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get two views, from Neal
Katyal, a former
acting solicitor general under
President Obama,

19:29.235 --> 19:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Jonathan Turley, a law
professor at George
Washington University.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jonathan, let's begin with you.

19:34.907 --> 19:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about the law, 1965
Immigration
and Nationality Act.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does it say, and how might
it impact
this executive order?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN TURLEY, Constitutional
Attorney,
George Washington University:
Well, I think

19:46.018 --> 19:47.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it can have an impact.

19:47.953 --> 19:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question that the law
says that
you cannot discriminate on the
basis of nationality

19:53.125 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or place of origin.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that certainly helps the
challengers.

19:57.296 --> 20:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But like much else in this
debate, much of
that law has been distorted.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It only takes you so far.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, the law doesn't
apply to refugees.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It applies to immigrants.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's used when you have visa
issues.

20:09.675 --> 20:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also, it doesn't cover religious
discrimination.

20:13.279 --> 20:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, in 1990, the act was
amended to exclude
procedural changes as a form of
discrimination.

20:22.221 --> 20:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that reduces the use of the
1965 law,
I think, as a serious challenge.

20:29.328 --> 20:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also it means that much of
that order,
as they challenge, doesn't fall
under the

20:34.400 --> 20:36.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So even if one aspect might be
challenged
successfully, the other aspects
of the order

20:39.638 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would remain.

20:41.540 --> 20:45.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Federal courts have a
longstanding policy
to minimize the degree to which
they strike

20:45.611 --> 20:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down a piece of legislation or
executive authority.

20:48.681 --> 20:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Neal, the way the
Immigration
and Nationality Act is written,
it mentioned

20:53.853 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an individual's place of birth
or place of
residence.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't mention religion
specifically.

20:59.792 --> 21:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The executive order seemed to be
narrowly
tailored, trying to avoid the
use of the word

21:05.030 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
religion.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in effect, did they write an
executive
order which would run afoul of
this law?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL, Former Acting U.S.
Solicitor
General: Oh, they did.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And don't be distracted by what
you just heard
from my friend Jonathan.

21:15.007 --> 21:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- but let me read the law,
first of all
-- quote -- "No person shall
receive any preference

21:19.912 --> 21:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or priority or be discriminated
against in
the issuance of an immigrant
visa because

21:24.884 --> 21:26.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nationality."

21:26.886 --> 21:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is most of what the
executive order
does, discriminates on the basis
of nationality.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Forget about the refugee
provision.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's about green card holders.

21:36.095 --> 21:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's about anyone who is
applying for a visa,
a student, an employee of a
company.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it applies broadly.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, of course, it doesn't reach
religious
discrimination.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's reached by the
Constitution, a separate
problem with the act.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So you have got two different
things.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got, it violates the
statute and it
violates the Constitution.

21:54.813 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump's advisers
are pretending
that this is 1952, in which this
1965 law

21:59.885 --> 22:00.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
didn't exist.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, unfortunately, it does.

22:02.588 --> 22:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is landmark legislation
passed contemporaneously
with the Voting Rights Act.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is just blatantly illegal
under that
law.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All right, I feel
like I need
a gavel and a black robe here,
gentlemen.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's talk about the
Constitution for just
a moment, if we could.

22:16.835 --> 22:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First Amendment, very important
amendment,
as we all know, the
Establishment Clause.

22:22.408 --> 22:27.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan, it seems on the face
of it that
you could make a pretty good
argument that

22:27.112 --> 22:32.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this runs afoul of the
Establishment Clause,
which basically says the United
States doesn't

22:33.018 --> 22:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get in the business of choosing
religions.

22:34.987 --> 22:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, I think
the most vulnerable
aspect of the order is the one
that gives

22:39.825 --> 22:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
preference to minority
religions, and those
people that were persecuted
under them.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That certainly is the weakest
spot.

22:49.969 --> 22:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm still skeptical about
whether you
could make a successful
establishment claim.

22:55.140 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of cases that have
to be moved
aside to get from here to there
if you want

23:00.179 --> 23:02.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to strike down this law.

23:02.114 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true there's establishment
issues, but
there's also plenary power in
the hands of

23:06.485 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a president.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All right, so the
administration
is trying to be very clear about
saying this

23:11.557 --> 23:13.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not a Muslim ban.

23:13.792 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's listen to candidate
Trump December
a year ago, when he first rolled
out this

23:18.931 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: Donald J. Trump is
calling for a total

23:23.302 --> 23:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and complete shutdown of Muslims
entering
the United States until our
country's representatives

23:30.709 --> 23:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can figure out what the hell is
going on.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

23:36.148 --> 23:37.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: OK.

23:38.050 --> 23:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, last Sunday, Rudy
Giuliani, close
adviser to President Trump in
the campaign

23:42.288 --> 23:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and through the transition, said
this:

23:44.123 --> 23:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUDY GIULIANI (R), Former Mayor
of New York:
We focused on, instead religion,
danger.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not based on religion.

23:50.763 --> 23:59.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's based on places where there
are substantial
evidence that people are sending
terrorists

23:59.938 --> 24:01.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into our country.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: OK, counselor, so
you're arguing
this case.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are those comments admissible?

24:05.244 --> 24:06.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL KATYAL: Absolutely.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And here's the thing.

24:08.347 --> 24:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was -- my last job was
the chief litigation
officer for the federal
government.

24:12.117 --> 24:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I made -- I made -- took use
of all the
precedents that Jonathan was
talking about

24:16.922 --> 24:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
broad power in immigration.

24:18.657 --> 24:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing extends as far as what
the president
has done.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.929 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
This is religious
discrimination.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here's what the Supreme
Court has said
about that -- quote -- "The
clearest command

24:27.099 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the First Amendment is that
one religious
denomination can't be officially
preferred

24:31.904 --> 24:33.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to another."

24:33.105 --> 24:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This executive order prefers
Christians to
Muslims.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You have got it.

24:38.610 --> 24:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president himself said so
contemporaneously
when he issued the executive
order to the

24:42.247 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christian Broadcast Network.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is just un-American and
unconstitutional.

24:45.951 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jonathan,
then-candidate Trump
and his adviser, Rudy Giuliani,
more recently,

24:54.326 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did they undermine their own
case?

24:55.994 --> 24:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, they
certainly undermined
their case.

24:59.565 --> 25:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the Justice Department
attorneys are
in fetal positions every time
someone like

25:05.571 --> 25:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this speaks about the purpose of
a law.

25:08.874 --> 25:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the longstanding view of the
Justice Department
has been what legislators say
about a law

25:15.514 --> 25:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to the motivation of the law
is not controlling.

25:17.883 --> 25:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been in cases where the
Justice Department
has maintained that position,
that you have

25:22.388 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at the law as to whether
it's lawful
or constitutional.

25:26.558 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The court doesn't make
assumptions about -- or
speculation about the
motivations behind the

25:33.065 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

25:34.700 --> 25:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the law has an otherwise bona
fide purpose,
the courts tend to go with that.

25:38.771 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't see a court, any court
saying that
what a candidate said on the
trail is going

25:46.044 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be material in terms of
whether this law
is struck down.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm surprised that Neal even
suggests
that.

25:52.184 --> 25:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been in cases where those
types of
arguments have been raised, and
courts have

25:55.621 --> 25:56.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shot it down.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, what if -- I mean,
Trump clearly
said that.

26:00.392 --> 26:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he then gave this law to
someone to draft,
and they came back with a law
that is not

26:05.464 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a Muslim ban.

26:07.332 --> 26:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I don't like the law, but I
don't think
any court is going to look at
this law and

26:11.870 --> 26:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say it's a Muslim ban, because
it's not.

26:14.273 --> 26:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's plenty to object about
this law without
making it something it's not.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't ban all Muslims.

26:20.345 --> 26:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I know people don't like to
say that
because they -- sort of like
Richard III,

26:23.949 --> 26:26.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you want to think of your
enemies as worse
than they are.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have to think about
this law as
worse than it is.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not a Muslim ban on a
legal basis.

26:32.291 --> 26:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, if it walks
like a duck,
talks like a duck, et cetera,
isn't this legal

26:36.628 --> 26:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parsing that they have come to
this executive
order?

26:39.331 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at the context
and the comments,
you have to come to the
conclusion that at

26:44.136 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least religion was on their
minds in some
fashion.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL: Oh, religion was
more than on
their minds.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think Jonathan is just wrong.

26:50.175 --> 26:54.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a First Amendment
religion challenge
in which the motivations of the
law will be

26:54.313 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looked to, and courts do so.

26:56.148 --> 27:00.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's particularly
underscored here,
because what has the new defense
of this law

27:00.185 --> 27:01.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been by the White House?

27:01.286 --> 27:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's, oh, we're not focused on
religion.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're focused on security.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All right, much
to discuss
here.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just in a word, going to the
Supreme Court?

27:08.527 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will this end up at the Supreme
Court?

27:10.462 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL: No, I think this is
indefensible,
and I think that the Justice
Department, after

27:13.432 --> 27:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they lose in district court
after district
court, won't bring this even to
the Court

27:17.369 --> 27:18.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Appeals.

27:18.670 --> 27:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I certainly wouldn't have if I
were in the
government.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jonathan, Supreme
Court case?

27:21.540 --> 27:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN TURLEY: It could go to
the Supreme
Court, but you have to be
careful what you

27:24.243 --> 27:26.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ask for.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to get a new nominee
to that court,
and might not be the type of
court you want

27:29.448 --> 27:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to appeal this case, if you're
with the ACLU.

27:31.683 --> 27:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Neal Katyal,
Jonathan Turley,
thank you both very much.

27:36.488 --> 27:43.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL KATYAL: Thank you.

27:43.762 --> 27:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
the Supreme
Court and President Trump's
much-anticipated

27:51.637 --> 27:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
choice to be announced tonight.

27:53.739 --> 27:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we are joined by
Elizabeth Wydra,
president of the progressive
Constitutional

27:58.710 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Accountability Center, Michael
Carvin, former
deputy assistant attorney
general in the Office

28:04.416 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Legal Counsel during the
Reagan administration.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's now in private practice.

28:09.588 --> 28:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent
for "The National Law Journal"
and our "NewsHour"

28:14.760 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regular.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we hope to be joined shortly
by Tom Goldstein,
founder of SCOTUSblog.com.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Marcia, I'm going to start
with you.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We keep hearing that it's down
to two individuals.

28:27.372 --> 28:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is after 21 names that
President Trump
gave us back during the campaign
last May.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are we to make of the
finalists, if that's
what they are?

28:37.316 --> 28:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are they different from the
long list
we originally saw?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, I think the original list
really did

28:44.022 --> 28:50.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contain very solid conservative
judges on
it, either on federal appellate
courts and

28:50.862 --> 28:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even on some state Supreme
Courts.

28:52.998 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two now that we're focused
on, Judge Gorsuch,
who is in Colorado, and Judge
Hardiman, who

28:59.972 --> 29:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is from Pennsylvania -- he sits
in Pittsburgh
-- Gorsuch sits in Denver, I
believe.

29:05.877 --> 29:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are -- they have risen to
the top, I
think, especially because they
seem closest

29:12.618 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Justice Scalia's
jurisprudence.

29:14.486 --> 29:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, if you recall, President
Trump said
during the campaign that he
wanted to appoint

29:20.158 --> 29:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone who was like Justice
Scalia, the late
Justice Scalia.

29:24.930 --> 29:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Judge Gorsuch
really is closest
to Justice Scalia in his
approach to judging.

29:35.107 --> 29:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think all of the finalists
would have considered
themselves close to Justice
Scalia as originalists

29:41.913 --> 29:43.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and textualists.

29:43.882 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Judge Gorsuch is really
probably the most
-- has been the most vocal and
most passionate

29:48.453 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about using originalism and
textualism to
interpret the Constitution and
statutes.

29:54.026 --> 29:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Carvin,
how would you
separate these two, if that's
who they are,

29:59.197 --> 30:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the finalists, from that long
list that we
originally saw?

30:02.634 --> 30:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CARVIN, Former Deputy
Assistant Attorney
General: Well, to echo what
Marcia said, they'd

30:04.269 --> 30:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both be worthy successors to
Scalia.

30:06.171 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They share the same approach tot
law, which
is to interpret the law
according to its text

30:10.575 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and structure, and not impose
your own personal
values, to act as an umpire, not
as a legislator.

30:16.682 --> 30:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Judge Gorsuch probably
digs a little
deeper into the law and is more
vocal, if

30:22.054 --> 30:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you will, about the virtues of
originalism.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Deeper than?

30:25.824 --> 30:31.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CARVIN: Judge Hardiman,
the other
candidate from Pittsburgh, which
is no way

30:31.363 --> 30:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to suggest that Judge Hardiman
is not an excellent
lawyer, which he certainly is.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just that I think Judge
Gorsuch perhaps
has stood out among the current
federal judiciary,

30:39.838 --> 30:44.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because he takes a very
intellectual, very
deep-seated approach to why
originalism is

30:44.710 --> 30:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correct and how you get to the
correct answers.

30:46.778 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elizabeth Wydra,
what would
you add to looking at these two
who appear

30:50.782 --> 30:52.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be the finalists?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA, Constitutional
Accountability
Center: Yes, I think whichever
one is the

30:54.553 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee, we're going to be look
very closely
to see whether he is someone who
will apply

30:57.689 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Constitution and its
guarantees of equality
and justice for all, indeed, to
all people,

31:02.394 --> 31:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just those who look like him
or have the
same amount of money in their
bank account

31:06.565 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or who pray like him.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump made a statement
that he thought
his nominee would represent
Christians fairly,

31:12.437 --> 31:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, obviously, is a little
bit concerning,
given that Supreme Court
justices, first of

31:16.341 --> 31:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all, are not supposed to anyway,
and certainly
not one religion over another.

31:19.177 --> 31:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, also, we will be
looking, especially
in this moment where we have
seen just over

31:22.981 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past few days how important
the courts
are as a check upon
unconstitutional violations

31:29.087 --> 31:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the elected branches, we
will be looking
to see whether the nominee is
someone who

31:32.991 --> 31:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can serve as that check, even
against policies
of the president who is going to
be putting

31:37.162 --> 31:38.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him on that bench.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Goldstein is
joining us
now from Los Angeles.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tom, welcome.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what do you look for
tonight?

31:44.369 --> 31:48.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been talking about what
it is that
characterizes these two apparent
finalists,

31:48.306 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judge Gorsuch and Judge
Hardiman.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

31:52.144 --> 31:53.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you looking for?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM GOLDSTEIN, Founder,
SCOTUSblog.com: Well,
I think that the president
really is going

31:55.447 --> 31:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get a lot of credit from
conservatives.

31:57.916 --> 32:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that probably the big
difference is
just the cases that they have
heard.

32:02.554 --> 32:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judge Gorsuch has heard more
cases about religious
liberty, whereas Judge Hardiman
has heard

32:07.125 --> 32:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more cases related to guns.

32:09.094 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And both those issues appeal to
conservatives
who are very concerned about the
Supreme Court.

32:12.998 --> 32:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're going to see more
drama from
President Trump than we usually
see in rollouts

32:17.803 --> 32:19.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
related to the Supreme Court.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we're going to hear a
lot of sound
and fury that will ultimately
probably amount

32:23.008 --> 32:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to nothing, because Republicans
simply have
the power, between the
presidency and the

32:27.746 --> 32:29.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate, to get through
essentially anyone.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Marcia Coyle,
is that how
you see it, that a lot of drama,
but in the

32:35.053 --> 32:39.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
end the president and his
allies, Republican
allies, are pretty much going to
get what

32:39.991 --> 32:40.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want?

32:40.992 --> 32:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I think it's
probably true.

32:43.595 --> 32:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not quite sure really what
the Democrats'
thinking will be at this point.

32:48.767 --> 32:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that there are some
Democrats who would
like to block any nomination at
this point,

32:56.141 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're very angry about
the way President
Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick
Garland, was

33:02.647 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treated in the Senate.

33:04.516 --> 33:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had -- the Senate Republicans
refused to
hold hearings or a vote on that
nomination.

33:09.020 --> 33:12.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So they see it as sort of
payback: Maybe we
should block this one.

33:12.824 --> 33:17.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the other hand, Senate
Republicans -- sorry
-- Senate Democratic Leader
Chuck Schumer

33:17.762 --> 33:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said, we're going to look
and see if the
nominee is within the
mainstream.

33:23.835 --> 33:29.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If he's not within the
mainstream, then we
will block or try to block.

33:29.674 --> 33:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess it will depend on
how he defines
mainstream, mainstream of what.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think it's going to be
interesting.

33:37.716 --> 33:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Carvin,
how does one
define mainstream when it comes
down to individuals

33:42.687 --> 33:44.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like these judges?

33:44.723 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CARVIN: Well, Chuck
Schumer defines
it as a judge who will impose
Democratic policies

33:47.259 --> 33:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the country and twist the law
to accomplish
that.

33:50.195 --> 33:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think -- I guarantee you
that he won't
think anybody on Trump's list is
within the

33:54.666 --> 33:56.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mainstream.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they will engage in the
sort of massive
resistance that they have
already been engaging

33:59.271 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in during the Trump presidency.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, you're going
to see a
lot of this personal
demagoguery, attacking

34:05.911 --> 34:11.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fine people as not being
sufficiently committed
to civil rights and the like.

34:11.349 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't make a lot of sense
objectively,
because, remember, this is
replacing Scalia.

34:15.854 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's not as if this
replacement can move
the court more to the right than
it is.

34:20.058 --> 34:24.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court right now is quite
liberal in terms
of gay marriage and affirmative
action and

34:24.162 --> 34:25.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other issues.

34:25.964 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, all you're doing is
preserving the status
quo of a relatively liberal
court.

34:29.768 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nonetheless, I think, partially
because of
the Garland issue, the Democrats
are going

34:34.272 --> 34:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make this a lot of sound and
fury.

34:36.207 --> 34:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Garland issue
being Merrick
-- again, as Marcia Coyle said,
Merrick Garland,

34:40.111 --> 34:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who President Obama picked
almost a year ago,
and the Republicans said they
weren't going

34:43.214 --> 34:44.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hold hearings for him.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Wydra, do you see the
court, as
Michael Carvin just described
it, as pretty

34:48.486 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much on the liberal end of the
spectrum?

34:50.322 --> 34:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Well, I think
it would have
been if Merrick Garland,
perhaps, had been

34:53.892 --> 34:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confirmed, as he should have
been.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's a conservative court.

34:57.829 --> 35:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Roberts court is led by
conservative justices,
which is not to say that they
don't sometimes

35:02.100 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule in liberal ways, in more
progressive
ways that conform with the
Constitution's

35:07.472 --> 35:09.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
text and history.

35:09.341 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think there's going to be
a focus on
this nominee no matter what,
because every

35:14.679 --> 35:16.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
justice on the court is
important.

35:16.581 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the integrity of
the court as
an independent arbiter of what
the Constitution

35:22.854 --> 35:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, and the pinnacle of our
independent judiciary,
which will make sure that the
Constitution's

35:28.493 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
structural provisions are
respected, so this
justice is important.

35:33.131 --> 35:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is a chance
that we are
going to have a real fight to
make sure that

35:38.870 --> 35:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this nominee doesn't share the,
frankly, authoritarian
views that the president has
exhibited.

35:45.010 --> 35:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael -- I'm
sorry, Tom Goldstein,
how do you see the court?

35:51.016 --> 35:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it is Judge Gorsuch or
Judge Hardiman
or someone else, if it's all
been -- because

35:56.988 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we don't know for sure.

35:58.323 --> 36:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House hasn't confirmed
that they're
the finalists.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if it's one of these, how
does the court
shift?

36:04.796 --> 36:06.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

36:06.331 --> 36:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't
think the court
ask does shift very much.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the court's considerably
more conservative
than Michael Carvin describes.

36:13.238 --> 36:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's quite right to say, in
the main,
you're probably looking at
somebody who is

36:16.775 --> 36:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot like Justice Scalia.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what does happen is, you
extend that for
a generation.

36:21.212 --> 36:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're talking about someone who
is likely
to be on the court for a
quarter-century or

36:25.150 --> 36:26.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

36:27.052 --> 36:30.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it locks in whatever the
ideology of
the court is now in a really
important way

36:30.321 --> 36:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it avoids a shift to the
court on the
left that Elizabeth Wydra
described.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is, you just --
it changes
when you're a judge and you
become a justice.

36:38.630 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You get freed from a lot of the
constraints
of existing precedent.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So nobody ought to say with
great confidence
what any of these judges will do
when they're

36:46.337 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Supreme Court justice.

36:48.239 --> 36:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservative Republicans have
gotten a lot
better about not putting on
somebody who is

36:52.310 --> 36:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
squishy, who might move a lot.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's still unpredictable.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just quickly
want to go around
the table before we wrap up and
ask each of

36:59.084 --> 37:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you about the process that these
names have
come out, that you had a
candidate for president

37:04.489 --> 37:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting out almost two dozen
names, and now
we're down to two.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a prime-time news
conference.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marcia, is this different from
the way it's
normally done?

37:11.729 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think
every president
looks to certain individuals and
certain groups

37:16.835 --> 37:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for input in terms of who may
most reflect
that president's own ideology,
philosophy.

37:24.609 --> 37:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was no different, I
think, in this
case.

37:28.413 --> 37:34.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump reportedly was
assisted by
the conservative Federalist
Society and the

37:34.252 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conservative Heritage
Foundation.

37:37.555 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the rollout, having,
we're told,
both judges at the White House
right now,

37:44.129 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is puzzling, different, and
I guess we
have to wait and see.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, 45 seconds.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Carvin, is this unusual
to do it like
this?

37:51.636 --> 37:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CARVIN: Well, I think
President Trump
was much more specific than most
presidents

37:55.907 --> 37:57.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with -- that normally
you're going
to give a general sense of who
you're going

37:59.878 --> 38:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to appoint, but this was a very
important
issue because of Justice
Scalia's passing,

38:04.549 --> 38:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Trump was very
clear about the
kind of justice he was going to
appoint.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think he probably has a
more specific
mandate than most of his
predecessors in terms

38:13.091 --> 38:13.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of who he's going to name.

38:14.092 --> 38:14.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just a few
seconds.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Your thought on the process.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Yes, I think
one of the unusual
parts of this process was that
Trump was very

38:19.330 --> 38:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clear about his litmus test.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He had three, abortion,
religious liberty,
and guns.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And normally you don't do that
because it
suggests you're guaranteeing a
vote.

38:26.437 --> 38:27.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that was very unusual.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Goldstein,
five seconds.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: It's usually less
of a circus
than this.

38:32.343 --> 38:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Tom
Goldstein joining
us from Los Angeles, we're glad
you made it

38:37.115 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the traffic.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: Thanks so much.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elizabeth Wydra,
Marcia Coyle,
and Michael Carvin, thank you
all.

38:42.687 --> 38:43.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Thanks.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Great to be
with you.

38:45.523 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we hope you
will join us
tomorrow night, when I sit down
with Vice

38:47.091 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Mike Pence at the
White House.

38:48.793 --> 38:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be his first television
interview
since taking office.

38:55.767 --> 39:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Let's take a
different look
at the impact of the immigration
orders from

39:05.743 --> 39:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the lens of higher education.

39:07.912 --> 39:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the focus of our weekly
segment Making
the Grade.

39:11.149 --> 39:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are nearly one million
international
students in U.S. colleges and
universities.

39:16.020 --> 39:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number of students who came
from the seven
affected countries is much
smaller, about

39:20.491 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
17,000, and most of those are
from Iran.

39:24.028 --> 39:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's temporary ban
sparked anxiety
and protests on a number of
campuses around

39:28.533 --> 39:29.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

39:29.968 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Faculty and students both
expressed worries
about the wider message.

39:33.638 --> 39:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here are some reactions, first
at the City
University of New York, or CUNY,
and then

39:38.309 --> 39:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from an Iranian student at the
University
of Alabama.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HERCULES REED, ®MD-BO-City
University of
New York: You cannot look at the
faces of

39:43.047 --> 39:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly half-a-million students
of CUNY without
seeing the faces and stories of
millions around

39:48.553 --> 39:49.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

39:49.954 --> 39:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Forty percent of our CUNY
students are born
in another country.

39:54.325 --> 39:58.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than half of us speak a
second language
at home.

39:58.529 --> 40:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At my campus alone, we have
students representing
over 150 countries.

40:03.735 --> 40:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I just got a postdoctoral
offer from
another U.S. university, and I'm
just worried

40:10.308 --> 40:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about my future, let alone
living in the U.S.
I'm worried that they're going
to deport me.

40:16.281 --> 40:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: More perspective
on these issues
now from Angel Cabrera, the
president of the

40:20.251 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Mason University, the
largest public
university in Virginia, serving
about 34,000

40:25.590 --> 40:27.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
students.

40:27.425 --> 40:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born in Madrid, Cabrera is the
first native
of Spain to lead an American
university.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Good to have you with us, Mr.
Cabrera.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA, President, George
Mason University:
Thank you for having me.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: First of all,
let's talk about
your perspective as an immigrant
yourself,

40:37.835 --> 40:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having seen the university
system here from
Spain, and now on the inside.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm curious how that affects
your perspective
on this whole issue.

40:46.611 --> 40:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: Well, first of
all, the American
universities have a tremendous
advantage around

40:52.417 --> 40:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, because they're the
number one
place where students from all
over the world

40:57.388 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want to study.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was there myself.

41:00.325 --> 41:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I graduated from college from
Madrid, Spain,
and my dream was to come to one
of the great

41:05.530 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American research universities.

41:07.432 --> 41:10.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And like that, there are
thousands, hundreds
of thousands of students from
around the world

41:10.802 --> 41:12.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every year.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And the higher
education system
here really does remain a
magnet, doesn't

41:14.906 --> 41:15.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: Absolutely.

41:17.942 --> 41:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not only that gives the
American university
a great advantage, but it gives
an advantage,

41:21.379 --> 41:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also, to the American economy.

41:23.247 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when you do the numbers
and look at,
for example, out of the recent
start-ups,

41:27.585 --> 41:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how many have reached $1 billion
or more,
about 40 percent of them have
been founded

41:33.224 --> 41:36.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or co-founded by a foreign-born
individual.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of them, by the way, come
to the U.S.
to study.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: My understanding
is most student
don't have green cards.

41:41.933 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have student visas.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: That's correct.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Which means that
that carve-out
for green cards that we have
been talking

41:47.972 --> 41:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the past couple of days
doesn't apply
to most of these students.

41:51.309 --> 41:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, give us an idea of the
immediate impact
on your campus and campuses
elsewhere in the

41:56.681 --> 41:57.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANGEL CABRERA: Yes.

41:59.517 --> 42:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, in our case, we have 82
students who
have what we call an F-1 visa,
which is a

42:04.889 --> 42:07.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
student visa, from those
countries.

42:07.158 --> 42:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have about five J-1 visa
holders, who
tend to be exchange scholars.

42:12.997 --> 42:13.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be a visiting
professor.

42:14.031 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could be someone getting
their Ph.D. here.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are trying to figure out
where all of them
are.

42:21.005 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have accounted for
most of them.

42:23.775 --> 42:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard, unfortunately,
from one of
our students from Libya who was
stuck in Istanbul

42:29.547 --> 42:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to board a plane to come
to us.

42:31.749 --> 42:35.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So she may have to cancel
classes this semester
and try to figure out whether
maybe she can

42:35.920 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take some of the class online.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: What is your
advice to students
whether they're here or there?

42:41.058 --> 42:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: Well, what we're
telling our
employees, our students, our
faculty is, don't

42:48.466 --> 42:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go anywhere right now, until
it's more clear,
because if you step outside of
the United

42:55.139 --> 42:57.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, you may not be able to
come back in.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's, of course, easier said
than done.

42:59.944 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of them have research
projects or they
may have even family issues that
require for

43:05.116 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them to go outside.

43:06.784 --> 43:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we're saying, do your
best to not
leave the country.

43:09.887 --> 43:14.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: The idea,
according to the
Trump administration, is to make
things safer

43:14.425 --> 43:16.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Americans.

43:16.461 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just this past November, a
Somali refugee,
student at Ohio State
University, had a stabbing

43:21.933 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spree; 11 people were injured
before he was
subsequently killed.

43:25.903 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a sense among yourself
and other
college presidents that this is
a measure

43:31.409 --> 43:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could make things safer on
campuses?

43:33.444 --> 43:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: Well, I don't
have the data.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have the evidence.

43:38.382 --> 43:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that those people who
make these decisions
may have data that really links
the presence

43:45.490 --> 43:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those kinds of students to
national security
issues.

43:49.093 --> 43:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have that kind of
evidence.

43:51.028 --> 43:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our campus, our students from
those countries
actually have never posed a
threat of any

43:55.533 --> 43:57.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kind.

43:57.435 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the contrary, I think that
the presence
of people from all over the
world increases

44:00.738 --> 44:02.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the understanding of our
students.

44:02.773 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're in class with people
from other
countries, you get to see the
world in a more

44:06.711 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuanced way.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You start to understand how
things are perceived
from other angles.

44:11.749 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, from my perspective, one of
the best things
that one can do to in fact
improve the understanding

44:19.223 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and diminish the probability of
safety issues
is to create understanding, is
to engage in

44:24.862 --> 44:26.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scholarly exchange.

44:26.697 --> 44:30.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's worth
putting this, I
think, in context into the
larger economic

44:30.601 --> 44:32.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ecosystem.

44:32.303 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American university system
has a direct
link to certainly Silicon
Valley.

44:36.207 --> 44:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lots of Silicon Valley CEOs came
to the United
States through this route
specifically.

44:43.080 --> 44:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over time, how much of an impact
would this
have, ultimately, potentially,
on jobs in

44:48.586 --> 44:50.354 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America?

44:50.454 --> 44:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: Well, I think
when we talk
about immigration, most people
start thinking

44:54.158 --> 44:56.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immediately about low-skilled
labor.

44:56.360 --> 45:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The part that is left out, and
it shouldn't
because it's essential to the
economy of the

45:02.133 --> 45:05.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States, it's the
knowledge worker.

45:05.603 --> 45:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the graduate student; 75
percent or more
of graduate students in
engineering and computer

45:11.976 --> 45:15.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
science in the United States
today are immigrants.

45:15.212 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at start-ups in
technology,
some of the most innovative
companies, the

45:18.649 --> 45:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones that all of our graduates
want to work
for, about 40 percent of those
that have achieved

45:23.621 --> 45:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1 billion or more were founded
or co-founded
by immigrants.

45:27.458 --> 45:32.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look at scientific
achievement, 40
percent of the Nobel Prize
winners in this

45:33.097 --> 45:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, whether it's chemistry,
medicine
and physiology or physics, about
40 percent

45:39.170 --> 45:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were born outside of the United
States.

45:40.471 --> 45:42.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So our science is tied to
immigration.

45:42.807 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our entrepreneurship is tied to
immigration.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our innovation is tied to
immigration.

45:47.445 --> 45:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Angel Cabrera,
president of
George Mason University, thank
you for your

45:51.182 --> 45:52.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

45:52.183 --> 45:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGEL CABRERA: You're welcome.

45:53.184 --> 45:56.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for having me.

45:56.921 --> 46:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we look at
efforts to change
the face of classical music, and
shake up

46:09.200 --> 46:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tradition while keeping true to
the sound.

46:12.570 --> 46:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is our guide.

46:14.505 --> 46:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An orchestra
performing with
singers.

46:20.244 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See anything unusual?

46:22.146 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a recent concert by the
Dallas Opera, the
focus was on the conductors,
women conductors.

46:29.420 --> 46:37.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the still highly
traditional world
of classical music, that is
unusual.

46:37.294 --> 46:46.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the culmination of the
second annual
Hart Institute for Women
Conductors, six women

46:46.737 --> 46:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and four observers, chosen from
156 applicants
around the world, taking part in
an intensive

46:53.444 --> 46:59.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two-week rehearsal workshop,
combined with
sessions on how to build and
maintain a career.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH CERNY, General Director,
Dallas Opera:
I have absolutely seen very
talented women

47:01.886 --> 47:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are held back from where
they ought to
be.

47:04.722 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's the
brainchild of Dallas
Opera general director Keith
Cerny.

47:08.492 --> 47:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH CERNY: I think there are
some individuals
who are opposed to the idea of
women leaders,

47:14.999 --> 47:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether on the podium or running
large opera
companies.

47:17.301 --> 47:20.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fortunately, there aren't that
many of those
people, but there's certainly
some.

47:20.871 --> 47:25.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more generally, I think
it's an issue
where, because there's fewer
women in those

47:25.876 --> 47:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positions, search committees and
general directors
and symphony CEOs don't tend to
think so much

47:30.581 --> 47:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about hiring women for those
opportunities.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's just not
part of their
thinking?

47:34.585 --> 47:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEITH CERNY: It's just not part
of the thinking.

47:36.487 --> 47:40.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: According to
industry data,
of the nine largest American
opera companies

47:40.891 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by budget, none has a female
music director
and principal conductor.

47:46.797 --> 47:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Marin Alsop in Baltimore,
who served on
the faculty at the Dallas
workshop, remains

47:54.839 --> 47:59.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sole woman music director at
the nation's
24 largest orchestras.

47:59.477 --> 48:05.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Dallas, Cerny hired Nicole
Paiement as
principal guest conductor, and
she played

48:06.016 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a large role at the institute,
encouraging.

48:07.852 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT, Principal Guest
Conductor,
Dallas Opera: When you have an
idea, which

48:10.354 --> 48:11.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are always very, very good...

48:11.756 --> 48:12.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cajoling,
teaching.

48:12.923 --> 48:14.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT: ... say one
thing and move
on.

48:15.025 --> 48:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You sort of explain it five
times, but I think
we get it the first time.

48:18.796 --> 48:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Paiement runs her
own small
opera company in San Francisco,
and travels

48:24.001 --> 48:25.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world performing with
orchestras.

48:25.903 --> 48:30.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT: I know there is
that surprise
phenomenon every time I'm guest
conducting

48:31.041 --> 48:33.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the first time.

48:33.410 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are surprised when I arrive
on the podium.

48:36.180 --> 48:37.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have the physique.

48:37.181 --> 48:38.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm a woman.

48:38.182 --> 48:39.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a small woman.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you mean?

48:41.185 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You sense that the audience is
surprised?

48:42.553 --> 48:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT: It's not the
audience, but
the musicians.

48:44.188 --> 48:48.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I arrive, I can feel that
they are like,
oh, OK, that's our conductor.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a little bit of a
surprise.

48:50.394 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can be refreshing.

48:52.163 --> 48:53.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But do you have
-- does that
make you have to prove yourself,
or...

48:54.098 --> 48:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT: I have -- no,
not at all,
because they see what I'm doing
on the podium

48:58.002 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not there to be a leader and
to be the
boss and to be -- but to make
music as a collaborative

49:03.174 --> 49:04.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
art form.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, you know, the art of
conducting has changed
a great deal.

49:07.044 --> 49:08.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The era of the tyrant on the
podium...

49:08.813 --> 49:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right, that
stereotype.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICOLE PAIEMENT: That stereotype
is long gone.

49:12.383 --> 49:18.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Romanian
conductor Mihaela
Cesa-Goje recalls something she
learned from

49:18.823 --> 49:20.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one of her mentors.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIHAELA CESA-GOJE, Conductor:
Marin Alsop
is giving a very, very good
example.

49:23.060 --> 49:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if a woman goes and conducts
with her
hand like that, everybody,
maybe, they might

49:29.934 --> 49:32.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, oh, that's such a girly
thing.

49:32.570 --> 49:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if a man does that, he's so
sensitive.

49:35.906 --> 49:40.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I think it's a lot of
question of perception,
how people are looking.

49:40.444 --> 49:47.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I try not to focus so much
on this, because
if I'm thinking about this every
day, then

49:47.117 --> 49:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you just don't do anything.

49:48.986 --> 49:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That was what we
heard from
others here as well, including
the youngest

49:52.890 --> 49:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
participant, 26-year-old Tianyi
Lu, who grew
up in New Zealand, love the
music, embrace

49:59.196 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the work, and focus on how to
get better.

50:02.433 --> 50:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're all used to being a
outnumbered
in this world.

50:04.969 --> 50:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIANYI LU, Conductor: It's just
a different
dynamic.

50:06.737 --> 50:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been in master classes
where I'm the
only girl, and I think...

50:10.307 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what happens?

50:11.408 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIANYI LU: Well, certain things
have happened.

50:13.277 --> 50:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, for me, it's more
to do with,
sometimes, it's very easy for
everyone to

50:17.181 --> 50:21.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretend like they're really
confident, whereas
I don't think I'm the sort of
person who can

50:21.485 --> 50:23.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pretend as well as others.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I actually need real
confidence, and that
comes with time in front of the
orchestra,

50:27.958 --> 50:33.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time with people who are
experienced giving
me their suggestions, their
support and encouragement.

50:33.697 --> 50:37.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, for me, that's the
important thing.

50:37.835 --> 50:42.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Time in front of
a prestigious
ensemble is key to the
institute.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For a conductor, the orchestra
is her instrument.

50:45.943 --> 50:52.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rehearsals were augmented by
one-on-one sessions
with more seasoned conductors,
including Italian

50:52.283 --> 50:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conductor Carlo Montanaro.

50:54.151 --> 50:59.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is there something that a
conductor has
to have, you know, that you must
have to be

50:59.924 --> 51:02.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good -- what makes a great
conductor?

51:02.159 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARLO MONTANARO, Conductor:
Charisma.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Charisma?

51:05.796 --> 51:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLO MONTANARO: Knowledge,
technique, being
true on the podium, not fake
yourself on the

51:11.702 --> 51:15.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
podium, don't make a show,
believe in the
music that you're conducting.

51:15.639 --> 51:19.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you see
differences in women
and men conductors?

51:19.510 --> 51:20.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARLO MONTANARO: No, zero.

51:20.511 --> 51:21.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Zero.

51:21.512 --> 51:22.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARLO MONTANARO: I see a
musician.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't treat them women, men.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

JEFFREY BROWN: Off the podium,
there were
other very practical lessons, on
building

51:30.821 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a resume and networking, whether
and how to
hire an agent, and developing
executive leadership

51:37.261 --> 51:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skills, in order to one day move
into upper
management.

51:40.531 --> 51:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We really have to do our
homework.

51:42.466 --> 51:46.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We really have to educate
ourselves if we
are going to be in this field.

51:46.570 --> 51:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will most likely be the
musical director
of an orchestra.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you will have understand
about all of
that.

51:51.942 --> 51:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You are going to have to deal
with a board.

51:53.644 --> 51:58.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the board is going to talk
to you about
numbers, right?

51:58.649 --> 52:04.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: American
Elizabeth Askren has
guest conducted in many leading
European venues

52:04.355 --> 52:08.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, like the others here, is
hoping one day
to be a music director.

52:08.792 --> 52:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She saw the institute as a great
opportunity
for learning with and from other
women.

52:13.464 --> 52:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH ASKREN, Conductor:
It's a safe space
for us to treat some of those
issues, some

52:17.167 --> 52:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of which are just, you know,
common, everyday
things, like questions that all
conductors

52:22.139 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to face.

52:23.640 --> 52:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there are some issues
to explore
that may pertain to women.

52:28.212 --> 52:34.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that the numbers are
rather low in
positions of directorship in
opera, why is

52:35.052 --> 52:35.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

52:36.053 --> 52:37.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can we talk about that?

52:37.821 --> 52:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Dallas Opera
has made a
20-year commitment to this
institute.

52:40.357 --> 52:44.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked general director Keith
Cerny how he
will judge success.

52:44.528 --> 52:48.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEITH CERNY: It would be
terrific to think
that, 20 years from now, this
whole issue

52:48.365 --> 52:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have gone away, and men and
women will
be equally evaluated for
positions on the

52:53.137 --> 52:54.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
podium.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that may be a little
optimistic, but
what I want...

52:56.006 --> 52:57.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You do?

52:57.574 --> 52:59.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEITH CERNY: I do,
unfortunately, because,
there's been no improvement.

52:59.543 --> 53:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been static for 25 years.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it is starting to
improve, slowly.

53:03.514 --> 53:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Dallas, I'm
Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

53:08.285 --> 53:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you know
what I think.

53:12.089 --> 53:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need more women conductors.

53:13.724 --> 53:15.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Said the maestra
of news.

53:15.392 --> 53:16.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:16.393 --> 53:17.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: All right.

53:17.394 --> 53:18.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I agree.

53:18.395 --> 53:19.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's it for the "NewsHour"
tonight.

53:19.396 --> 53:20.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

53:20.397 --> 53:22.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.
