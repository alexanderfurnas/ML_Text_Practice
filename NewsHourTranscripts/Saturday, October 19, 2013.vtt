01:16.833 --> 01:18.367
EXTENT OF THE SUFFERING IS

01:18.367 --> 01:19.833
RARELY SEEN BECAUSE OF THE

01:19.833 --> 01:21.833
DANGERS OF REPORTING THE STORY

01:35.367 --> 01:36.533
>> Reporter: IT'S THE SOUNDTRACK

01:36.533 --> 01:38.433
OF A WAR THAT CLAIMS HUNDRED

01:38.433 --> 01:39.200
EVERY WEEK

01:39.200 --> 01:40.600
HOSPITALS AT THE HEART OF IT

01:48.700 --> 01:50.867
SYRIA'S WAR, LIKE SO MANY, A

01:50.867 --> 01:54.200
SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENCE

01:54.200 --> 01:55.800
THIS LITTLE BOY'S RIBS WER

01:55.800 --> 01:58.433
BROKEN IN THE SAME EXPLOSION

01:58.433 --> 02:00.767
NEARBY, A YOUNGER BOY, WHO HAS

02:00.767 --> 02:01.867
BEEN SHOT.

02:01.867 --> 02:02.700

TODAY AND UNDER INTENS

02:35.733 --> 02:36.167
DIFFICULTY

WE'VE HAD FIVE GUNSHOT WOUND

02:38.400 --> 02:39.833
PATIENTS IN THE LAST SIX T

02:39.833 --> 02:47.567
EIGHT HOURS AND WE JUST HEAR

02:47.567 --> 02:47.600
NOT FAR AWAY

02:47.600 --> 02:48.800
IT'S ALL FULL-ON

02:48.800 --> 02:50.967
>> Reporter: HE RARELY LEFT TH

02:50.967 --> 02:51.367
HOSPITAL

02:51.367 --> 02:52.400
EVEN OUTSIDE, THERE WAS LI

02:52.400 --> 02:58.333
RESPITE.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.333
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF EVERYTHING

03:00.333 --> 03:03.000
HERE, EXCEPT CASUALTIES.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.800
STICKY TAPE IS USED TO HOLD DOWN

03:04.800 --> 03:06.100
A PATIENT.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.533
THE DIY DRILL IS USED IN

03:09.533 --> 03:11.200
OPERATIONS IN A ROOM WHOSE

03:11.200 --> 03:12.433
WINDOW HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT BY A

03:12.433 --> 03:12.933
EXPLOSION.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.233
>> IT'S A PURE WAR ZONE, S

03:15.233 --> 03:16.967
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO THEIR VER

03:16.967 --> 03:18.967
BEST BUT THERE ARE -- THERE'

03:18.967 --> 03:22.767
HARDLY ANY PROPERLY MEDICALL

03:22.767 --> 03:23.967
QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB

03:23.967 --> 03:24.700
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.800
>> Reporter: MOST OF HIS

03:25.800 --> 03:28.067
PATIENTS WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

03:28.067 --> 03:30.067
BY IT'S HOW THE SNIPERS TARGETED

03:30.067 --> 03:33.333
THEM THAT IS HIS WAR'S REA

03:33.333 --> 03:33.500
HORROR

03:33.500 --> 03:36.233
ONE HE REVEALED BACK IN BRITAIN.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.833
>> IT SEEM TO ME IT WAS A GAME

03:37.833 --> 03:39.600
THEY WERE HAVING WITH EACH

03:39.600 --> 03:41.467
OTHER, ONE DAY WE'D HAVE

03:41.467 --> 03:43.133
PREGNANT WOMEN BEING BROUGHT I

03:43.133 --> 03:45.233
WITH GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE

03:45.233 --> 03:47.800
UTERUS, NOT ONLY ONE OR TWO, BUT

03:47.800 --> 03:49.233
SEVEN OR EIGHT WHICH MEANT TO ME

03:49.233 --> 03:51.000
IN THEY MUST BE TARGETIN

03:51.000 --> 03:52.767
PREGNANT WOMEN AND THE FOLLOWING

03:52.767 --> 03:55.000
DAY, WE WOULD GET PEOPLE COMIN

03:55.000 --> 03:56.200
IN WITH CHEST WOUNDS IN TH

03:56.200 --> 03:57.800
RIGHT SIDE OF THEIR CHEST AN

03:57.800 --> 03:59.100
THEN THE FOLLOWING DAY

03:59.100 --> 04:00.567
EVERYBODY WOULD COME IN WITH A

04:00.567 --> 04:01.267
GROIN WOUND.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.300
SO IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THER

04:03.300 --> 04:06.267
WAS A SORT OF LIKE A DEATH GAM

04:06.267 --> 04:08.333
GOING ON WITH THE SNIPERS.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.000
>> Reporter: VERY OFTEN, THE

04:11.000 --> 04:12.133
SNIPERS' GAME TOOK CHILDREN'

04:12.133 --> 04:12.500
LIVES.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.800
>> MANY CHILDREN WOULD DIE O

04:14.800 --> 04:17.967
THE OPERATING TABLE BECAUSE YO

04:17.967 --> 04:19.633
JUST WERE A LITTLE TOO LATE TO

04:19.633 --> 04:21.167
GET TO THE BLOOD VESSEL AND IT

04:21.167 --> 04:22.800
WAS -- IT WAS VERY PAINFUL,

04:22.800 --> 04:24.067
LOT OF THE TIME.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.700
I MEAN, THEY DIE IN FRONT OF

04:25.700 --> 04:26.133
YOUR EYES.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.767
IF YOU HAD A DEATH ON THE TABLE,

04:27.767 --> 04:29.200
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME EVEN TO

04:29.200 --> 04:30.500
GRIEVE OVER YOUR PATIENT THA

04:30.500 --> 04:32.233
DIED

04:32.233 --> 04:33.967
>> Reporter: DOCTORS HAVE BEEN

04:33.967 --> 04:34.833
TARGETED, TOO.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.233
A BRITISH COLLEAGUE OF DAVID'S

04:37.233 --> 04:39.333
WAS KILLED THIS YEAR

04:39.333 --> 04:40.600
ANOTHER EXPLOSION, THE HOSPITA

04:40.600 --> 04:43.067
IS ON THE FRONT LINE

04:43.067 --> 04:46.400
THIS LITTLE GIRL HAS BEEN SHOT

04:46.400 --> 04:49.567
IN FACE BUT SHE AND ALL OF THE

04:49.567 --> 04:51.067
CHILDREN YOU'VE SEEN IN TH

04:51.067 --> 04:52.233
REPORT SURVIVE

04:52.233 --> 04:54.267
SYRIA'S DEATH TOLL, THOUGH

04:54.267 --> 04:56.033
TELLS ANOTHER STORY.

04:56.033 --> 04:58.033
DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS O

04:58.033 --> 05:00.900
DOCTORS LIKE DAVID

05:00.900 --> 05:03.567
BILL NEILY, ITV NEWS

05:03.567 --> 05:06.267
>> FOR A BROADER LOOK, JOINED BY

WASHINGTON FROM ANDREW TABLER AT

05:09.267 --> 05:10.300
THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE

05:10.300 --> 05:12.967
SO, FIRST, LET'S START TALKING

05:12.967 --> 05:14.800
ABOUT THIS POSSIBLE, TENTATIVE

05:14.800 --> 05:16.133
MEETING IN GENEVA SECRETARY OF

05:16.133 --> 05:18.333
STATE KERRY AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN

05:18.333 --> 05:22.700
HINTING AT

05:22.700 --> 05:24.400
IF THERE WERE PEACE TALKS WH

05:24.400 --> 05:25.800
SITS AT TABLE BETWEEN SYRIA AN

05:25.800 --> 05:26.133
THE REBELS

05:26.133 --> 05:28.100
>> THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT SEEMS

05:28.100 --> 05:30.100
LEAK IT WOULD SHOW UP ON BEHAL

05:30.100 --> 05:32.133
OF THE REBELS IT'S FAR FRO

05:32.133 --> 05:34.133
QULEER SYRIAN OPPOSITION

05:34.133 --> 05:36.367
COALITION, THE LARGEST UMBRELL

05:36.367 --> 05:38.333
WOULD BE THE PARTY THAT WOUL

05:38.333 --> 05:40.833
SIT ACROSS FROM THE ASSA

05:40.833 --> 05:42.033
GOVERNMENT BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IF

05:42.033 --> 05:43.767
THE MEMBERSHIP OF THAT BODY,

05:43.767 --> 05:45.167
SPECIFIC LIT SYRIAN NATIONAL

05:45.167 --> 05:48.533
COUNCIL, WHICH HOLDSES THE

05:48.533 --> 05:49.533
LARGEST NUMBER OF SEATS WOUL

05:49.533 --> 05:49.833
AGREE.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.433
IN THE COMING DAYS THERE WOULD

05:51.433 --> 05:53.567
BE MEETING TO DETERMINE UNDE

05:53.567 --> 05:55.300
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHO WOULD

05:55.300 --> 05:56.500
GO TO GENEVA

05:56.500 --> 05:57.933
>> HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DECIDED

05:57.933 --> 06:02.267
ON THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND

06:02.267 --> 06:05.133
TODAY, WHETHER ONE SIDE IS

06:05.133 --> 06:06.533
GAINING OR LOSING TERRITORY.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.900
>> THE ARMED GROUPS INSIDE O

06:07.900 --> 06:10.133
THE COUNTRY ARE THE ONES THA

06:10.133 --> 06:12.000
ARE REALLY CONTROLLING THE SOR

06:12.000 --> 06:13.533
OF FLOW OF BATTLE AND THEY ARE

06:13.533 --> 06:15.333
THE ONES ALSO THAT ALONG WIT

06:15.333 --> 06:17.800
THE CIVILIANS AND LOCAL AREA

06:17.800 --> 06:19.233
INSIDE OF SYRIA, THEY'RE THE

06:19.233 --> 06:20.067
ONES THAT CARRY THE WEIGHT O

06:20.067 --> 06:22.600
THE BURDEN OF THE REVOLUTION

06:22.600 --> 06:24.300
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THEY WOULD B

06:24.300 --> 06:26.967
INVOLVED IN THE TALKS, MANY AR

06:26.967 --> 06:28.167
AGAINST THEM, SPECIFICALLY SOM

06:28.167 --> 06:30.267
OF THE MORE ISLAMIST BRIGADE

06:30.267 --> 06:32.000
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A

06:32.000 --> 06:33.967
CONSTRAINT UPON ANY PARTY THAT

06:33.967 --> 06:36.567
SITS ACROSS FROM THE ASSAD

06:36.567 --> 06:38.800
REGIME IN GENEVA

06:38.800 --> 06:41.133
>> HAVE WE SEEN ANOTHER SHIFT IN

06:41.133 --> 06:41.233
MOMENTUM

06:41.233 --> 06:44.400
>> I THINK THAT WE STILL SEE THE

06:44.400 --> 06:46.967
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE ASSAD

06:46.967 --> 06:48.267
REGIME AND THE REBEL FORCES,

06:48.267 --> 06:50.267
ASSAD REGIME PUSHING INTO AREA

06:50.267 --> 06:53.267
WHERE THE RUBBLES CARRYING OUT

06:53.267 --> 06:54.700
SPECTACULAR ATTACKS ON CHECK

06:54.700 --> 06:56.367
POINTS, SOMETIMES SUICID

06:56.367 --> 06:56.867
BOMBINGS

06:56.867 --> 06:59.600
ALSO, A KILLING OF A MAJOR

06:59.600 --> 07:01.300
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL IN THE

07:01.300 --> 07:02.800
EASTERN CITY

07:02.800 --> 07:06.067
SO, THEY CONTINUE TO DUKE IT OUT

07:06.067 --> 07:08.433
THROUGHOUT SYRIA WHILE THOSE I

07:08.433 --> 07:09.667
GENEVA PREPARE FOR TALKS THA

07:09.667 --> 07:10.633
MIGHT BE

07:10.633 --> 07:11.833
>> WE ALSO HAVE INDICATIONS NO

07:11.833 --> 07:13.567
THAT TURKEY'S GETTING INVOLVED

07:13.567 --> 07:14.533
THEY'RE STARTING TO FIGHT SOME

07:14.533 --> 07:15.733
OF THE REBELS BUT THEY HAV

07:15.733 --> 07:17.133
THEIR OWN REASONS.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.267
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:18.267 --> 07:20.800
THE PROBLEM IN THE NORTH AND THE

07:20.800 --> 07:24.000
EAST EXTREMISTS, AL QAED

07:24.000 --> 07:25.300
AFFILIATES, HAVE GROWN I

07:25.300 --> 07:26.533
STATURE AND NUMBER BECAUSE THOSE

07:26.533 --> 07:28.500
BORDERS ARE MORE OR LESS OPE

07:28.500 --> 07:30.800
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT RUN

07:30.800 --> 07:33.233
AGAINST A LOT OF TURKISH

07:33.233 --> 07:35.067
POLICIES, SPECIFICALLY

07:35.067 --> 07:36.500
CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN TH

07:36.500 --> 07:38.067
SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE

07:38.067 --> 07:38.433
COUNTRY.

07:38.433 --> 07:42.367
SO, A LOT OF THE BATTLES BETWEEN

07:42.367 --> 07:44.033
THE MAIN LINE OPPOSITION FORCE

07:44.033 --> 07:46.400
AND EXTREMISTS CONCERN BORDE

07:46.400 --> 07:47.867
CROSSINGS, CONCERN SMUGGLING AND

07:47.867 --> 07:48.500
FINANCING THE REVOLUTION

07:48.500 --> 07:53.167
>> THIS IS GOING TO SEEM

07:53.167 --> 07:55.233
SPECULATIVE BUT ANY CHANCE OF

07:55.233 --> 07:56.500
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION SNEER IN

07:56.500 --> 08:00.200
WE'RE VERY FAR FROM THAT

08:00.200 --> 08:03.000
UNCLEAR IF GENEVA WILL GET THE

08:03.000 --> 08:04.067
BASICS, A CEASE-FIRE O

08:04.067 --> 08:04.367
ANYTHING

08:04.367 --> 08:05.733
IT SEEMS AS IF WESTERN

08:05.733 --> 08:07.400
COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS RUSSIA

08:07.400 --> 08:09.733
WOULD LIKE TO PUSH FOR TALKS A

08:09.733 --> 08:11.533
THIS POINT TO GET THEM ROLLING

08:11.533 --> 08:14.567
THE QUESTION IS, IS THE PART

08:14.567 --> 08:16.333
THAT SITS ACROSS FROM THE ASSA

PLACE WHERE THEY CAN START UP

16:02.000 --> 16:02.433
BUSINESS

TEN YEARS, WHEN WE WILL NOTICE

FOR START-UP CHILE COME FROM

16:20.533 --> 16:22.233
CHILE ITSELF

16:22.233 --> 16:24.700
LIKE DANIEL, A COUPLE OF YEARS

AGO HE COULD ONLY DREAM OF START

16:27.267 --> 16:28.467
A MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS

IMPRECISE, THE INVESTMENT HA

17:23.800 --> 17:26.067
BEEN NET-POSITIVE.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.700
BECAUSE THE FOREIG

THE RETURN ON THE CHILEA

17:44.200 --> 17:45.467

INDICATION OF THE VASTLY

IMPROVED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE

CATHOLIC CHURCH.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.800
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

19:33.800 --> 19:35.833
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CATHOLIC

19:35.833 --> 19:38.500
CHURCH'S ROLE IN HOW MUCH IT DID

19:38.500 --> 19:41.900
TO HELP JEWS DURING THE HOLLOW

19:41.900 --> 19:44.400
CAST, IT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE

19:44.400 --> 19:46.100
BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND JEWS

IT'S A SYMBOLIC GESTURE TO SAY

THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WA

19:50.667 --> 19:52.067
SUPPORTIVE OF THE JEWISH

19:52.067 --> 19:53.167

19:53.167 --> 19:54.067
CONCERNS AND DID NOT WANT TO ADD

19:54.067 --> 19:56.267
TO THE CONCERNS.

19:56.267 --> 19:56.933
SYMBOLIC GESTURE

PAST 2,000 YEARS TIES BETWEE

20:04.033 --> 20:05.867
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND JEWS HAD

20:05.867 --> 20:06.667
NEVER BEEN THIS GOOD

20:06.667 --> 20:07.167
THIS IS A LONG PROCESS IN TH

20:07.167 --> 20:10.067
MAKING, RIGHT?

20:10.067 --> 20:11.267
>> A VERY LONG PROCESS

20:11.267 --> 20:14.733
I MEAN, FOR 2000 YEAR THAT WAS A

20:14.733 --> 20:17.800
BIG ISSUE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

IN THE 1960s THE VATICAN I

20:27.433 --> 20:29.100
ISSUED A DOCUMENT SAYING ALL

20:29.100 --> 20:30.733
JEWS SHOULD NOT BE HEL

20:30.733 --> 20:31.967
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF

20:34.567 --> 20:34.700
ANTI-SEMITISM.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.100
DOWN TO THE PEWS

20:38.100 --> 20:41.200
SO YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A GRADUAL

20:41.200 --> 20:41.467
PROCESS.

ANY TRIP TO ISRAEL POSES A

21:54.267 --> 21:55.267

23:48.967 --> 23:51.600
DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN

FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW THE KPC

WAS MOVING THROUGH THE HOSPITAL.
