WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:06.673
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.075
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.143
GWEN IFILL: On the
"NewsHour" tonight:

00:10.143 --> 00:14.381
REP. TREY GOWDY (R), South
Carolina: Madam Secretary, I
understand there are people,

00:14.381 --> 00:18.352
frankly, in both parties who
have suggested that this
investigation is about you. Let

00:18.352 --> 00:21.622
me assure you, it is not.

00:21.622 --> 00:27.227
GWEN IFILL: Hillary Clinton in
the hot seat. House Republicans
grill the former secretary

00:27.227 --> 00:33.300
of state for hours on the
Benghazi attack that killed four
Americans and sparked a
17-month-long

00:33.300 --> 00:35.302
investigation.

00:35.302 --> 00:38.705
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: There
was never a recommendation from
any

00:38.705 --> 00:44.544
intelligence official in our
government, from any official in
the State Department, or from

00:44.544 --> 00:51.184
any other person with knowledge
of our presence in Benghazi to
shut down Benghazi.

00:51.184 --> 00:56.590
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Thursday: A priest in Mexico
offers a place of refuge

00:56.590 --> 01:00.394
along a perilous
journey to the U.S.

01:00.394 --> 01:07.100
GWEN IFILL: And a beer maker's
secret recipe for success,
letting employees own the
company.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.405
WOMAN: The better I do, the
better we do. It really does
inspire us all to go above

01:11.405 --> 01:13.840
and beyond in a way that I
haven't experienced at other
employers.

01:13.840 --> 01:20.948
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:20.948 --> 01:25.519
(BREAK)

01:25.519 --> 01:34.761
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican Paul
Ryan now appears all but certain
to run for and be elected

01:34.761 --> 01:38.231
speaker of the House
of Representatives.

01:38.231 --> 01:45.038
The Wisconsin lawmaker won
support in his own party today
from key moderates, from
mainstream

01:45.038 --> 01:49.376
conservatives, and from a group
of fiscal conservative that
opposed the current House

01:49.376 --> 01:54.247
speaker, John Boehner. Ryan
cleared an even bigger hurdle
last night, when most of the

01:54.247 --> 01:58.585
harder-line conservatives in the
so-called Freedom Caucus voted
to support him. The House

01:58.585 --> 02:01.621
will choose its
speaker next week.

02:01.621 --> 02:07.661
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
vetoed a sweeping $600 billion
defense bill today. In an Oval

02:07.661 --> 02:12.032
Office ceremony, he took issue
with increasing war spending by
going around budget caps set

02:12.032 --> 02:14.434
by the so-called sequester.

02:14.434 --> 02:20.874
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I have repeatedly
called on Congress to eliminate

02:20.874 --> 02:26.513
the sequester and make sure that
we are providing certainty to
our military, so they can do

02:26.513 --> 02:30.751
out-year planning, ensure
military readiness, ensure our
troops are getting what they
need.

02:30.751 --> 02:35.288
This bill instead resorts to
gimmicks that does not allow the
Pentagon to do what it

02:35.288 --> 02:37.624
needs to do.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.294
GWEN IFILL: Republicans are
considered unlikely to muster
the votes needed to override the

02:41.294 --> 02:43.463
veto.

02:43.463 --> 02:48.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State John Kerry voiced cautious
optimism today about ending

02:48.668 --> 02:54.241
a spate of Israeli-Palestinian
violence. He met with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu

02:54.241 --> 02:59.913
for four hours, as both men
visited Berlin, Germany, and he
spoke to reporters afterward.

02:59.913 --> 03:04.685
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: There may be some things
that could be, in the next

03:04.685 --> 03:14.728
couple of days, put on the table
which would have an impact, I
hope, on the perceptions

03:14.728 --> 03:23.303
of everybody engaged that there
is a way to defuse the situation
and begin to find a way

03:23.303 --> 03:25.372
forward.

03:25.372 --> 03:30.677
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kerry called for
an end to incitement, without
singling out either side.

03:30.677 --> 03:36.116
He plans to meet with
Palestinian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan on
Saturday.

03:36.116 --> 03:42.155
Meanwhile, there was fresh
violence in Jerusalem. Two
Palestinians wounded a Jewish
man in a

03:42.155 --> 03:46.593
stabbing attack. Police killed
one of the assailants and
wounded the other.

03:46.593 --> 03:52.566
GWEN IFILL: The people of Sweden
were stunned today by a savage
attack on a school. It happened

03:52.566 --> 03:56.203
in the southern part of the
country, where a masked man
fatally stabbed two people,
before

03:56.203 --> 03:59.172
he was killed himself.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.276
Cordelia Lynch of Independent
Television News filed this
report.

04:03.276 --> 04:09.950
CORDELIA LYNCH: Clad in black,
wearing a metal helmet, wielding
a sword, while casually posing

04:09.950 --> 04:16.857
with students unaware of the
malice behind the mask. They
assumed he was dressed up for

04:16.857 --> 04:21.128
Halloween, but it's believed
moments after this photo was
taken, he attacked and killed

04:21.128 --> 04:26.166
a teacher and pupil,
injuring two others.

04:26.166 --> 04:31.771
Police were called to Kronan
School in Trollhattan, north of
Gothenburg, shortly after 10:00
this

04:31.771 --> 04:37.477
morning. They said the 21-year
old attacker knocked on the
doors of two classrooms and

04:37.477 --> 04:43.283
targeted those who opened them.
After shooting the attacker
dead, police searched his home

04:43.283 --> 04:46.686
and recovered what they called
interesting items. They are now
looking into possible

04:46.686 --> 04:50.023
far-right sympathies.

04:50.023 --> 04:57.030
But what led up to the rampage
is still unclear. It is, the
prime minister said, a dark day

04:57.030 --> 04:58.899
for Sweden.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.735
STEFAN LOFVEN, Swedish Prime
Minister (through translator):
That which should never happen

05:01.735 --> 05:06.973
has happened here today, and
this is why this is a tragedy
that affects the whole country.

05:06.973 --> 05:11.878
CORDELIA LYNCH: The town has a
large immigrant population and
this was an ethically diverse

05:11.878 --> 05:17.284
school. The killer lived
locally. The fact he was
seemingly able to enter so
easily,

05:17.284 --> 05:22.022
though, has prompted calls for
much tighter security across the
country.

05:22.022 --> 05:26.660
GWEN IFILL: The last such attack
on a school in Sweden was in
1961.

05:26.660 --> 05:32.332
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Russian
military has announced plans to
build a base in an island group
that's

05:32.332 --> 05:37.704
partly claimed by Japan. The
islands, known as the Kurils,
are located just miles off

05:37.704 --> 05:43.276
the Japanese mainland. The
Soviet Union seized the chain at
the end of World War II. As a

05:43.276 --> 05:47.514
result, Japan never signed a
formal peace treaty with Moscow.

05:47.514 --> 05:52.352
GWEN IFILL: In economic news,
the United Auto Workers union
approved a new four-year
contract

05:52.352 --> 05:56.957
with Fiat Chrysler, after
rejecting an earlier version.

05:56.957 --> 06:02.062
And Wall Street got a big boost
from upbeat reports by
McDonald's and eBay. The Dow
Jones

06:02.062 --> 06:08.668
industrial average gained 320
points to close near 17490. The
Nasdaq rose almost 80 points,

06:08.668 --> 06:12.372
and the S&P 500 added 33.

06:12.372 --> 06:18.078
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from now on,
a round of golf could mean a
term in jail for members

06:18.078 --> 06:24.784
of China's Communist Party. New
rules have banned all 88 million
party members from playing

06:24.784 --> 06:30.223
golf, in a crackdown on
corruption and high-living. The
party's anti-corruption office
says that

06:30.223 --> 06:35.028
golf courses are where illegal
deals get done, and where
officials spend time playing
instead

06:35.028 --> 06:36.162
of working.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.631
GWEN IFILL: I know some people
not going to China now.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.399
(LAUGHTER)

06:39.399 --> 06:44.738
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour": a marathon hearing
on Benghazi; how a beer

06:44.738 --> 06:48.708
maker raises the stakes on
employee performance; finding
sanctuary on the dangerous
journey

06:48.708 --> 06:57.417
to the U.S., and much more.

06:57.417 --> 07:06.893
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
returned to Capitol Hill today
to defend her actions as

07:06.893 --> 07:12.966
secretary of state during the
2012 attack on a diplomatic
outpost in Libya.

07:12.966 --> 07:18.638
The Republican-led Select
Committee on Benghazi is
investigating the attack on a
U.S. Consulate,

07:18.638 --> 07:23.643
which left four Americans dead,
including Ambassador Chris
Stevens.

07:23.643 --> 07:28.948
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports on the
contentious hearing.

07:28.948 --> 07:35.322
LISA DESJARDINS: It was a
full-blown Capitol Hill
spectacle, with one of the
longest lines

07:35.322 --> 07:41.695
in recent years, and reporters
crushing forward to try to get
inside.

07:41.695 --> 07:45.765
Republican Committee Chairman
Trey Gowdy began by defending
the Benghazi investigation.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.635
REP. TREY GOWDY (R), South
Carolina: Madam Secretary, not a
single member of this committee

07:48.635 --> 07:56.643
signed up to investigate you or
your e-mail. We signed up to
investigate, and therefore

07:56.643 --> 08:05.719
honor, the lives of four people
that we sent into a dangerous
country to represent us,

08:05.719 --> 08:10.223
and to do everything we can to
prevent it from happening to
others.

08:10.223 --> 08:14.227
LISA DESJARDINS: Former
Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton in turn started with a
slow,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.696
deliberate tone.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.933
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: As
secretary of state, I had the
honor to

08:19.933 --> 08:26.639
lead and the responsibility to
support nearly 70,000 diplomats
and development experts across

08:26.639 --> 08:30.043
the globe.

08:30.043 --> 08:41.921
Losing any one of them, as we
did in Iraq, Afghanistan,
Mexico, Haiti, and Libya, during

08:41.921 --> 08:49.562
my tenure was deeply painful for
our entire State Department and
USAID family and for

08:49.562 --> 08:58.805
me personally. I traveled to 112
countries as secretary of state.
Every time I did, I

08:58.805 --> 09:04.811
felt great pride and honor
representing the country that I
love.

09:04.811 --> 09:08.882
LISA DESJARDINS: Soon, though,
Republican Susan Brooks of
Indiana launched what would

09:08.882 --> 09:14.654
become a theme: Was Clinton
paying enough attention to
Benghazi? Brooks pointed to a

09:14.654 --> 09:18.958
small stack of Clinton's
Benghazi e-mails the year of the
attack, 2012, and a larger

09:18.958 --> 09:21.694
one from the year before.

09:21.694 --> 09:27.934
REP. SUSAN BROOKS (R), Indiana:
There are 795 e-mails in this
pile. We have counted

09:27.934 --> 09:33.373
them. There's 67 e-mails
in this pile in 2012.

09:33.373 --> 09:40.413
And I'm troubled by what I see
here. In this pile in 2011, I
see daily updates, sometimes

09:40.413 --> 09:46.152
hourly updates from your staff
about Benghazi and Chris
Stevens.

09:46.152 --> 09:53.827
When I look at this pile in
2012, I only see a handful of
e-mails to you from your senior

09:53.827 --> 09:59.966
staff about Benghazi. And let me
just share for you in your
records that we have reviewed,

09:59.966 --> 10:06.906
there is not one e-mail to you
or from you in 2012 when an
explosive device went off

10:06.906 --> 10:10.076
at our compound in April.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.646
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
Congresswoman, I didn't conduct
most of the business that

10:13.646 --> 10:19.986
I did on behalf of our country
on e-mail. I conducted it in
meetings.

10:19.986 --> 10:27.193
I read massive amounts of memos,
a great deal of classified
information. I made a lot of

10:27.193 --> 10:31.965
secure phone calls. I was in and
out of the White House all the
time. There were a lot

10:31.965 --> 10:38.204
of things that happened that I
was aware of and that I was
reacting to.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.941
If you were to be in my office
in the State Department, I
didn't have a computer. I didn't

10:41.941 --> 10:45.645
do the vast majority
of my work on e-mail.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.715
LISA DESJARDINS: But another
Republican, Georgia's Lynn
Westmoreland, wasn't satisfied
with Clinton's

10:48.715 --> 10:50.717
defense.

10:50.717 --> 10:54.521
REP. LYNN WESTMORELAND (R),
Georgia: You knew about these
two incidents that have been
mentioned

10:54.521 --> 11:02.128
previously. It's not a matter if
you knew about them. It's a
matter of what you did

11:02.128 --> 11:06.266
about them. And, to us, the
answer to that is nothing.

11:06.266 --> 11:12.739
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The
experts, who I have the greatest
confidence in, and who have

11:12.739 --> 11:17.076
been through so many difficult
positions, because practically
all of them had rotated

11:17.076 --> 11:23.316
through Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Iraq, Yemen, other places, they
were the ones making the

11:23.316 --> 11:31.491
assessment. No one ever came to
me and said, we should shut down
our compound in Benghazi.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.725
REP. LYNN WESTMORELAND: I'm not
saying I'm not saying shut it
down. I'm just saying protect

11:32.725 --> 11:33.259
it.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.028
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Right.

11:35.028 --> 11:39.332
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican Jim
Jordan of Ohio pushed on whether
Clinton knew the attack

11:39.332 --> 11:42.702
was planned by terrorists, but
still allowed official U.S.
statements to claim it was a

11:42.702 --> 11:45.939
spontaneous anti-American mob.

11:45.939 --> 11:49.042
REP. JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: Why
didn't you just speak plain to
the American people?

11:49.042 --> 11:53.046
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I did
state clearly and I said it
again in more detail the next

11:53.046 --> 11:58.184
morning, as did the president.
I'm sorry that it doesn't fit
your narrative, Congressman.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.154
I can only tell you
what the facts were.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.923
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton's
fellow Democrats sounded their
own theme, arguing that she's

12:03.923 --> 12:07.160
the victim of a partisan
political witch-hunt.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.630
REP. ADAM SMITH (D), Washington:
Even today's hearing, not a
single solitary thing that

12:10.630 --> 12:16.703
hasn't already been discussed
repeatedly. So we have learned
absolutely nothing. The

12:16.703 --> 12:23.376
question is, have we found
anything substantively that
tells us something different
about what

12:23.376 --> 12:25.912
happened in Benghazi? And the
answer to that question is no.

12:25.912 --> 12:30.450
LISA DESJARDINS: The partisan
tension bubbled over, as
Republicans repeatedly asked
about

12:30.450 --> 12:33.987
e-mails about Libya from
longtime Clinton friend and
previous committee witness
Sidney

12:33.987 --> 12:35.455
Blumenthal.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.724
REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D),
Maryland: Will the gentleman
yield? Will the gentleman yield?

12:37.724 --> 12:41.361
LISA DESJARDINS: Ranking
Democrat Elijah Cummings broke
in to accuse Chairman Gowdy of
distorting

12:41.361 --> 12:43.096
information.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.599
REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS: These
facts directly contradict the
statements you made on national

12:46.599 --> 12:48.901
television this past Sunday.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.536
REP. TREY GOWDY: No, that's --
no, sir, with all due respect,
they do not. With that, we're

12:50.536 --> 12:52.138
adjourned.

12:52.138 --> 12:56.776
LISA DESJARDINS: In the end,
this longest hearing yet on the
Benghazi attacks may not

12:56.776 --> 12:59.679
have done much to satisfy either
party. The committee aims to
finish its investigation

12:59.679 --> 13:01.280
by January.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.916
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

13:03.916 --> 13:08.955
JUDY WOODRUFF: At this moment,
that hearing is still going on.

13:08.955 --> 13:13.292
And we take a closer look,
though, at the day's events so
far with Anne Gearan, national

13:13.292 --> 13:17.664
correspondent with The
Washington Post, and Yochi
Dreazen, managing editor of
"Foreign

13:17.664 --> 13:20.667
Policy" magazine. I spoke with
them just a short time ago.

13:20.667 --> 13:25.838
And, Anne Gearan, Yochi Dreazen,
thank you both for being here.

13:25.838 --> 13:29.709
You both have covered this
story, this Benghazi story, for
so long.

13:29.709 --> 13:32.578
So, Yochi, listening to today,
what is it that this special
committee was trying to

13:32.578 --> 13:34.247
do?

13:34.247 --> 13:37.583
YOCHI DREAZEN, "Foreign Policy":
Genuinely, I think there was
some truth to what Kevin

13:37.583 --> 13:40.620
McCarthy said, the old joke
about how a gaffe in Washington
is when you actually tell the

13:40.620 --> 13:42.522
truth.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.325
And he lost his speakership,
arguably, by saying that this
committee was trying to damage

13:46.325 --> 13:50.196
Hillary Clinton politically. And
if you were watching the hearing
today, you're not hearing

13:50.196 --> 13:52.765
anything new. These questions
have been asked again and again.
The answers were given again

13:52.765 --> 13:55.234
and again.

13:55.234 --> 13:59.505
Basically, what you saw almost
from the beginning were
Democrats and Republicans
literally yelling

13:59.505 --> 14:03.342
at each other. This wasn't like
an august hearing designed to
try to get down to something

14:03.342 --> 14:08.481
we didn't know. This was
politics, pure and simple.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.784
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anne Gearan,
though, was the committee,
though, trying to make it --
trying

14:11.784 --> 14:17.924
to make the point that Hillary
Clinton was responsible for the
decision that left this

14:17.924 --> 14:22.361
outpost in Libya unprotected,
and that led to the death of the
ambassador and three others?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.797
ANNE GEARAN, The Washington
Post: Yes, absolutely.

14:24.797 --> 14:31.270
I mean, the Republicans went at
it several different ways, but
their basic goal in that

14:31.270 --> 14:36.943
line of questioning was to try
to establish a link between
Hillary Clinton as the secretary

14:36.943 --> 14:42.915
of state and decisions that were
made in the bureaucracy that
either could have contributed

14:42.915 --> 14:47.620
or could have ameliorated
what happened in Benghazi.

14:47.620 --> 14:55.261
And, again, as Yochi said, this
is something that has been
explored really ad nauseam
before,

14:55.261 --> 14:59.966
and her answer was really pretty
simple, which is, look, I was
the secretary of state. I

14:59.966 --> 15:04.837
wasn't going to be down in the
weeds of a lot of these security
decisions, and I wouldn't

15:04.837 --> 15:09.475
presume to tell professionals
whose job it is to make those
decisions exactly how to

15:09.475 --> 15:12.178
do their jobs.

15:12.178 --> 15:16.649
And she really tried to turn the
table on Republicans in a couple
of places, including

15:16.649 --> 15:21.287
by pointing out that it's the
same diplomatic security agents
who protect them when they

15:21.287 --> 15:27.994
are overseas on CODEL trips and
that -- making the point sort
of, you know, subtly that,

15:27.994 --> 15:31.063
like, hey, would you want
somebody else telling them what
to do?

15:31.063 --> 15:34.767
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Yochi
Dreazen, did we learn anything
more about how she made -- how

15:34.767 --> 15:39.372
those decisions were made and
her role in what finally
happened?

15:39.372 --> 15:43.910
YOCHI DREAZEN: I think the most
interesting moment by far was
when Congressman Jim Jordan

15:43.910 --> 15:48.815
was saying to her, in some
detail, that you, Secretary
Clinton, told your family in one

15:48.815 --> 15:52.451
e-mail that this was an attack
linked by al-Qaida, that you
said in a phone call with an
Egyptian

15:52.451 --> 15:57.190
leader that this was not
something tied to an anti-Muslim
video, and then saying, but

15:57.190 --> 16:00.193
the talking points coming out of
the White House at the time
were, this wasn't al-Qaida

16:00.193 --> 16:02.495
and this was linked
to this video.

16:02.495 --> 16:07.099
I thought that was the most
effective and sort of new moment
in the entire line of
questioning.

16:07.099 --> 16:10.837
And her answer back wasn't
terribly strong. Her answer back
was, they were still sifting

16:10.837 --> 16:14.207
intelligence. We were trying to
sort our way through it. But she
couldn't quite give the

16:14.207 --> 16:16.742
direct answer why she was saying
in an e-mail something very
different than what was being

16:16.742 --> 16:18.444
said publicly.

16:18.444 --> 16:23.015
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, for the
audience, why does it matter?
Why did that -- why does it

16:23.015 --> 16:27.153
matter whether she was saying
one thing? Because she tried to
say, well, I was trying to warn

16:27.153 --> 16:30.223
other countries. We didn't want
to see this thing happening
anyplace else.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.926
YOCHI DREAZEN: So, the
Republican charges basically are
two parts.

16:33.926 --> 16:38.331
One is, she ignored security,
so, substantively, she could
have done more to make the
compound

16:38.331 --> 16:42.201
safer, and then much more
damaging from their point of
view is that the White House
basically

16:42.201 --> 16:46.005
lied. They're saying the White
House knew one thing, for
political reasons, they said

16:46.005 --> 16:49.742
something else, and there's a
cover-up, and she was a major
part of that cover-up.

16:49.742 --> 16:54.247
That's basically what they have
been trying to say now for three
years, that she deliberately

16:54.247 --> 16:57.250
misstated what she knew to be
the cause of the attack, and
these e-mails were their best

16:57.250 --> 17:00.319
attempt today to try to
make that point again.

17:00.319 --> 17:06.092
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anne Gearan, you
know, the Hillary Clinton
campaign right now, they
obviously

17:06.092 --> 17:10.730
had some worry going into this
hearing. What was their
strategy?

17:10.730 --> 17:18.004
ANNE GEARAN: Well, yes, there
was some concern. Benghazi
remains the largest black mark
on

17:18.004 --> 17:23.776
her time as secretary of state,
and her time as secretary of
state is one of her main resume

17:23.776 --> 17:28.581
points in seeking the
2016 presidential.

17:28.581 --> 17:36.055
So, for sure, this is a big
hurdle they had to get over. Her
campaign is chiefly concerned

17:36.055 --> 17:40.293
that there might be some moment
where, you know, who knows,
maybe the Republicans do

17:40.293 --> 17:43.596
have some ace in the hole they
could pull out and surprise her
with, something that

17:43.596 --> 17:46.465
she wouldn't be able to answer.

17:46.465 --> 17:51.404
Failing that, there's a general
concern that there could be some
replay of the kind of

17:51.404 --> 17:55.641
emotional display she had the
last time she answered questions
about Benghazi on Capitol

17:55.641 --> 17:59.512
Hill, when she famously waved
her arms and said, what
difference at this point does it

17:59.512 --> 18:01.447
make?

18:01.447 --> 18:07.486
She made the point that she was
making back then today a couple
of times, but in a much

18:07.486 --> 18:13.492
more nuanced way, and that point
basically is that it doesn't
matter in terms of what

18:13.492 --> 18:18.798
happened in the death of four
people whether this was a
premeditated terrorist attack or

18:18.798 --> 18:22.368
a spontaneous event that grew
out of a street protest.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.036
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.572
ANNE GEARAN: And that's the crux
of the issue about whether the
White House was covering

18:26.572 --> 18:29.275
up the true origins
of the attack.

18:29.275 --> 18:33.813
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Yochi
Dreazen, what comes out of this?
Where does this lead? I mean,

18:33.813 --> 18:37.683
after she has testified, the
committee goes on. What do they
do with this information?

18:37.683 --> 18:42.421
YOCHI DREAZEN: So, some of the
numbers just on the hearings,
it's astounding. This is

18:42.421 --> 18:47.460
the 21st hearing on Benghazi. By
comparison, there were 22 public
hearings on 9/11.

18:47.460 --> 18:52.732
So, just to compare the two, 22
on 9/11, 21 on Benghazi. The
investigations are thought

18:52.732 --> 18:57.003
to have cost about $5 million.
This has been going on now 17
months. It's not clear to

18:57.003 --> 19:01.040
me or I think to really any
observer what is new that could
still be found.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.611
They have already pulled out
that there are things said
publicly different from what
were

19:05.611 --> 19:08.748
said privately, that there were
security failures. That has all
been out for quite some time.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.618
But there was one moment that I
thought was very interesting.
She said back at one point

19:12.618 --> 19:17.957
to them that the response to
this shouldn't be that
Washington decides, Democrat or
Republican,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.926
that diplomacy is too dangerous,
that it shouldn't be something
where America pulls out of
dangerous

19:20.926 --> 19:23.729
places because of
attacks like this.

19:23.729 --> 19:28.367
And I think that, ultimately, in
some ways, is the danger. Set
aside the politics, and

19:28.367 --> 19:30.870
if America decides we will not
send diplomats into dangerous
places, that's the lasting

19:30.870 --> 19:33.439
impact of Benghazi.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.307
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we
speak, the hearing is still
going on. And we will continue
to

19:35.307 --> 19:37.576
look at it.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.246
For now, though, we want to
thank you both, Yochi Dreazen
and Anne Gearan. We appreciate

19:40.246 --> 19:41.680
it.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.885
YOCHI DREAZEN: Thanks, Judy.

19:45.885 --> 19:51.257
ANNE GEARAN: Thank you.

19:51.257 --> 19:59.598
GWEN IFILL: For the first time
since 2011, an American soldier
has been killed in Iraq.

19:59.598 --> 20:04.170
It happened this morning during
a rescue mission at an Islamic
State prison.

20:04.170 --> 20:09.608
According to the Pentagon,
American and Kurdish commandos
raided the site in Northern
Iraq,

20:09.608 --> 20:14.880
freeing 70 captives, including
more than 20 from Iraqi security
forces. Five I.S. fighters

20:14.880 --> 20:18.417
were captured and
several were killed.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.420
Reporter Michael Gordon is in
Iraq covering this story for The
New York Times. I spoke

20:21.420 --> 20:24.023
with him a short time ago.

20:24.023 --> 20:28.394
So, Michael, tell us about what
the importance was of this
strike.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.129
MICHAEL GORDON, Diplomatic
Correspondent, The New York
Times: Well, it was important

20:30.129 --> 20:33.499
in a number of -- for
a number of reasons.

20:33.499 --> 20:42.575
First of all, it was a rescue
operation, and a fairly daring
one that involved American

20:42.575 --> 20:48.314
special operations forces,
including Delta Force, and
Kurdish special operations
forces

20:48.314 --> 20:53.452
brought to the scene by American
helicopters. So, it was a very
kind of proactive operation.

20:53.452 --> 21:00.392
But, also, it was really the
first time that we know of in
which American advisers have

21:00.392 --> 21:05.698
accompanied Iraqi or Kurdish
forces onto the battlefield. I
mean, up until now, they have

21:05.698 --> 21:09.802
been advising and training them,
but only within the confines of
training areas and

21:09.802 --> 21:15.641
bases. This time, they were
advising them in a support role,
but they were on the battlefield

21:15.641 --> 21:16.509
with them as well.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.578
GWEN IFILL: Who were the
70 hostages? Who are they?

21:19.578 --> 21:28.587
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, we don't
know precisely, but it was the
-- clearly, the Americans and

21:28.587 --> 21:36.962
the Kurds thought there were
some Peshmerga fighters there
who they were trying to rescue,

21:36.962 --> 21:40.599
and they thought there were,
perhaps, 20 people there. When
they got there, there were about

21:40.599 --> 21:46.338
70, and they included Iraqi
special -- Iraqi security
forces, but not Peshmerga.

21:46.338 --> 21:53.779
They included some local
citizens of Hawija who have been
incarcerated by the Islamic

21:53.779 --> 21:59.285
State, and perhaps some people
the Islamic State suspected as
traitors in their ranks.

21:59.285 --> 22:04.290
But we don't really know who all
of these 69 people are. The
Kurds are still sorting

22:04.290 --> 22:06.492
through them.

22:06.492 --> 22:12.231
GWEN IFILL: Was this strike
designed to and did it achieve
significantly degrading ISIL,

22:12.231 --> 22:16.468
the Islamic State forces in
that area of Northern Iraq?

22:16.468 --> 22:22.675
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, it was a
rescue operation. It was --
they, you know -- perhaps 20 or

22:22.675 --> 22:27.646
so militants were killed,
depending on whose figures you
can believe. But the point was

22:27.646 --> 22:31.951
-- the aim of the operation was
to rescue the people who were
being held in a building

22:31.951 --> 22:36.355
in Hawija, and who were
under threat of execution.

22:36.355 --> 22:40.492
And there was -- there have been
a number of atrocities there in
recent days. Here in

22:40.492 --> 22:45.864
the New York Times bureau, we
had a report a few days ago how
11 young people had been

22:45.864 --> 22:50.569
hung and strung up on a bridge
to -- retribution against their
parents who are associated with

22:50.569 --> 22:54.773
the Iraqi security forces. So
this was first and foremost a
rescue operation.

22:54.773 --> 23:00.112
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned,
Michael, earlier that there was
significant U.S. involvement

23:00.112 --> 23:03.048
in this rescue mission. What
does this tell us about the
state of the Iraqi Peshmerga

23:03.048 --> 23:05.784
forces who are involved?

23:05.784 --> 23:09.822
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, these
Kurdish forces are usually
pretty capable. These would have

23:09.822 --> 23:12.725
been the high-end
commando forces.

23:12.725 --> 23:19.531
So, on the one hand, it tells
you that the Americans have
enough confidence in them that

23:19.531 --> 23:27.806
they would join them in a rescue
operation in enemy territory.
This was a very -- Islamic

23:27.806 --> 23:34.580
State stronghold, and so that
they would have that -- a
certain agree of confidence in
them.

23:34.580 --> 23:39.952
You know, clearly, the Kurds are
not at the point where they can
do these things entirely

23:39.952 --> 23:46.492
on their own, and -- but that's
really not surprising. I think
the raid is really going

23:46.492 --> 23:52.598
to perhaps energize the debate
in the United States over the
American military role in

23:52.598 --> 23:54.633
the Middle East.

23:54.633 --> 23:58.737
I mean, a lot of critics say
that if we're going to make
headway against the Islamic

23:58.737 --> 24:03.075
State and roll them back, we're
probably going to have to do
more than just have advisers

24:03.075 --> 24:07.379
that stay within the
confines of military bases.

24:07.379 --> 24:11.517
Even General Dempsey when he was
chairman of the Joint Chiefs
said there might come

24:11.517 --> 24:18.223
a point when he would recommend
that advisers accompany Iraqi
forces, if, for example, the

24:18.223 --> 24:23.662
coalition was going to try to
evict the Islamic State from
Mosul. The critics, on the other

24:23.662 --> 24:28.367
hand, are going to cite this as
an example of mission creep,
because here you had advisers,

24:28.367 --> 24:30.803
and one was killed.

24:30.803 --> 24:36.575
It's the first American who was
killed, died of his wounds,
since American forces returned

24:36.575 --> 24:43.849
here after 2011. So, I think the
raid is going to have a lot of
significance for the debate

24:43.849 --> 24:51.256
in the United States about our
role here, perhaps, and that may
be sort of its larger

24:51.256 --> 24:54.793
significance in terms of
American policy in the region.

24:54.793 --> 24:58.997
GWEN IFILL: And it certainly
will be a continuing debate, and
not one that's ever flagged.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.534
Michael Gordon for The New York
Times tonight in Baghdad, thank
you very much.

25:02.534 --> 25:08.574
MICHAEL GORDON:
Right. Thank you.

25:08.574 --> 25:16.048
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:16.048 --> 25:22.521
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
migrants find rest 200 miles
from the U.S. border; lessons

25:22.521 --> 25:28.827
learned from the housing crisis;
and a stray bullet that changed
a young girl's life.

25:28.827 --> 25:34.933
But, first, let's look at an
unusual way of running a
business, by having your
employees

25:34.933 --> 25:40.139
own the company. One popular
craft brewery has made a name
for itself in part by going

25:40.139 --> 25:44.743
that route, with
strong results so far.

25:44.743 --> 25:48.480
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the story. It's part
of our weekly series Making

25:48.480 --> 25:51.850
Sense, which airs every
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

25:51.850 --> 25:58.657
PAUL SOLMAN: New Belgium
Brewing, known for its quirky
culture and Fat Tire, its
Belgian

25:58.657 --> 26:04.530
brew. This is its notorious Tour
de Fat, a beer-financed
travel-fest pushing bicycles

26:04.530 --> 26:07.599
over cars.

26:07.599 --> 26:12.104
At company headquarters in Fort
Collins, Colorado, co-founder
Kim Jordan loves to show off the

26:12.104 --> 26:14.173
suds themselves.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.276
KIM JORDAN, Co-Founder, New
Belgium Brewing: Should I show
you how to do the perfect pour?

26:17.276 --> 26:17.142
PAUL SOLMAN: The
perfect pour, yes.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.577
KIM JORDAN: OK.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.246
PAUL SOLMAN: A little bit out.
Whoops. Oh, I -- no, no, I
screwed it up already.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.381
KIM JORDAN: Yes. Yes.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.248
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, this
is a perfectly...

26:23.248 --> 26:24.383
KIM JORDAN: Yes. Well...

26:24.383 --> 26:27.719
PAUL SOLMAN: This is a
perfectly horrible pour.

26:27.719 --> 26:33.158
But what drew us here wasn't the
beer, though New Belgium now
sells 4 percent of all U.S.

26:33.158 --> 26:38.864
craft beer, 1 percent of all the
beer in America. New Belgium's
distinction, however, as a
business

26:38.864 --> 26:44.269
is that it is entirely
owned by its workers.

26:44.269 --> 26:49.274
Ex-New Yorker Doug Miller has
been at New Belgium for 20
years. Like most Americans,

26:49.274 --> 26:53.245
he had no stake in the firms he
worked for in his early days
back East.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.814
DOUG MILLER, New Belgium
Brewing: It's a job and you're
just coming in and you're
punching

26:55.814 --> 27:00.252
the clock and you're doing your
job. Here, you just do it more
because you're working

27:00.252 --> 27:05.557
for yourself. Like, I don't work
for New Belgium. I am working
for Doug Miller. I am working

27:05.557 --> 27:08.227
for people who work here.
That's the difference.

27:08.227 --> 27:13.899
KIM JORDAN: Beer is malt, and
hops, and yeast, and water.

27:13.899 --> 27:18.303
PAUL SOLMAN: And why did
co-founder and CEO Kim Jordan
sell the company to her workers,

27:18.303 --> 27:22.674
as opposed to a well-heeled
rival or a private financial
firm?

27:22.674 --> 27:31.049
KIM JORDAN: One of things that
we think is a big societal issue
is this widening gap

27:31.049 --> 27:38.423
between the haves and the
have-nots. And we realized that
we had an opportunity to support

27:38.423 --> 27:44.029
people owning something that was
increasing in value. Shared
equity has been an incredibly

27:44.029 --> 27:47.199
powerful engine for us.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.036
CHRIS MACKIN, Worker Ownership
Consultant: New Belgium's a
great example of using this

27:51.036 --> 27:54.139
structure to preserve a legacy.

27:54.139 --> 27:58.510
PAUL SOLMAN: Worker ownership
consultant Chris Mackin, who's
advised New Belgium.

27:58.510 --> 28:04.383
CHRIS MACKIN: For a company like
that to be consumed by a
multinational firm, and to lose

28:04.383 --> 28:07.920
its identity, to lose what's
special about it in order to
make a few extra bucks, that's

28:07.920 --> 28:10.822
not what Kim Jordan
was going to do.

28:10.822 --> 28:14.927
KIM JORDAN: You will notice on
your glass here, see this
lacing? That's actually a sign

28:14.927 --> 28:17.195
of a well-made beer.

28:17.195 --> 28:22.534
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the founder
became a poster child for worker
ownership, initiating an

28:22.534 --> 28:29.808
ESOP, an employee stock
ownership plan, which began
giving stock gradually to its
workers

28:29.808 --> 28:33.011
and ended up in a 100
percent takeover.

28:33.011 --> 28:37.316
CHRIS MACKIN: What she's done
has made it possible to reserve
that independence and

28:37.316 --> 28:41.753
to be able to reward the people
who made her a wealthy woman.

28:41.753 --> 28:46.458
PAUL SOLMAN: Reward them with
shares they sell back to the
company when they retire,

28:46.458 --> 28:53.465
a stock-based pension plan.
ESOPs represent both ownership
and retirement savings, which

28:53.465 --> 28:59.071
is why Congress made them the
only pension plans allowed to
borrow money for funding.

28:59.071 --> 29:03.342
KIM JORDAN: We were so excited
to brew this beer that we
decided to put it on tap today.

29:03.342 --> 29:09.615
PAUL SOLMAN: New Belgium, with a
host of varieties, is now the
eighth largest brewery in
America.

29:09.615 --> 29:13.018
Its fans flow through the
building on tours all the day
long.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.154
KIM JORDAN: How do you pour a
beer? I will show you how. And
then the taps are yours,

29:16.154 --> 29:17.422
OK?

29:17.422 --> 29:21.927
PAUL SOLMAN: The employees seem,
well, pretty juiced themselves.

29:21.927 --> 29:26.431
WOMAN: I feel like I have a
stake in what happens here and
that I have a -- play a part

29:26.431 --> 29:29.868
in making this awesome
place successful, yes.

29:29.868 --> 29:33.171
PAUL SOLMAN: Tiffany Banfield
works in the marketing
department for New Belgium.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.474
WOMAN: So you liked
it where it was?

29:35.474 --> 29:38.410
PAUL SOLMAN: Carrie Weady
(ph) is a graphic designer.

29:38.410 --> 29:43.448
WOMAN: The better I do, the
better we do, and I personally
take that to every day of

29:43.448 --> 29:46.985
my job, and it really does
inspire us all to go above and
beyond in a way that I haven't

29:46.985 --> 29:48.553
experienced at other employers.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.490
PAUL SOLMAN: So, why
doesn't everybody do it?

29:51.490 --> 29:55.193
WOMAN: Because they don't
believe that it is a profitable
model.

29:55.193 --> 30:00.198
PAUL SOLMAN: But it is, Kim
Jordan insists, if management
puts in the effort and is
willing

30:00.198 --> 30:04.136
to empower workers in
a variety of ways.

30:04.136 --> 30:09.875
KIM JORDAN: We're more
profitable than our industry
standards. We have a 3 percent
turnover

30:09.875 --> 30:16.915
rate. And more importantly to us
is our feeling of our engagement
with our co-workers.

30:16.915 --> 30:21.620
WOMAN: Each of those cities
brought some pretty great
incentives to the table.

30:21.620 --> 30:27.059
PAUL SOLMAN: A key feature of
New Belgium's worker engagement:
open-book management, teaching

30:27.059 --> 30:30.595
every employee how
to read the books.

30:30.595 --> 30:34.933
DOUG MILLER: And so they had
classes for us to go to. Like,
we're going to teach you how

30:34.933 --> 30:37.069
to read an income statement, how
to read a balance sheet, how to
understand cash flow,

30:37.069 --> 30:39.471
all those things.

30:39.471 --> 30:43.375
PAUL SOLMAN: The upshot? The
workers know exactly how the
company is doing financially,

30:43.375 --> 30:46.111
and how they are doing as well.

30:46.111 --> 30:49.848
DOUG MILLER: So, I am making
like the same money now that I
was making 20 years ago,

30:49.848 --> 30:53.819
when I was working in the Bronx
in New York City. But I have
more money now. It's just

30:53.819 --> 30:58.090
because I can manage it better.
That's the thing that blows me
away, is that you can

30:58.090 --> 31:02.027
be making $30,000, $40,000,
$50,000 a year and live in a
$300,000 house if you manage

31:02.027 --> 31:04.329
your money well.

31:04.329 --> 31:08.433
Are you operating at a profit
this month? You know, that's
what you got to ask yourself.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.903
PAUL SOLMAN: To Chris Mackin,
who's been pushing worker
ownership since the 1980s, ESOPs
are

31:11.903 --> 31:16.775
a no-brainer, the main and
obvious obstacle, workers don't
have the money to buy their

31:16.775 --> 31:18.577
businesses.

31:18.577 --> 31:23.115
CHRIS MACKIN: For this idea to
go to scale, you have to find
some way in which working

31:23.115 --> 31:29.121
people who don't have assets can
acquire companies that are worth
value.

31:29.121 --> 31:34.292
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Mackin has
started an investment fund that
will allow worker groups to
compete

31:34.292 --> 31:38.764
with private equity firms and
well-heeled competitors when an
owner wants or needs to

31:38.764 --> 31:40.499
sell.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.502
KIM JORDAN: The other beer that
we make is called Felix, and
that's the one that we get

31:43.502 --> 31:45.470
to taste today.

31:45.470 --> 31:50.609
PAUL SOLMAN: Happily for its
workers, New Belgium didn't need
Mackin's money. A bank

31:50.609 --> 31:56.114
ponied up much of the cash to
buy Kim Jordan's stock. She
financed the rest by accepting

31:56.114 --> 32:02.387
IOUs from the company, to be
paid off from future profits.
The risk, that the company

32:02.387 --> 32:09.294
will flounder, meaning lower
pensions for workers and iffy
IOUs for lenders, which suggests

32:09.294 --> 32:13.198
that it might take an unusually
committed owner to make worker
ownership happen.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.001
So, why did Jordan
take the chance?

32:16.001 --> 32:21.907
KIM JORDAN: One of the things
that has been really fun about
business is understanding

32:21.907 --> 32:28.480
that you can chose what you do
with profits. You get this one
life, right? And you get

32:28.480 --> 32:33.451
to think about, what am I going
to do that makes me sort of
joyful and sing? And this

32:33.451 --> 32:37.122
makes me joyful.

32:37.122 --> 32:43.428
PAUL SOLMAN: Fortunately for
her, Kim Jordan's IOUs look like
a pretty safe bet. New Belgium

32:43.428 --> 32:50.602
is slated to open a new
operation in North Carolina in
2016. And since it's only in 38

32:50.602 --> 32:54.005
states thus far, the beer may be
coming soon to a state near you.

32:54.005 --> 32:54.339
KIM JORDAN: And push in now.

32:54.339 --> 32:54.506
PAUL SOLMAN: And it will
stop it right there. OK.

32:54.506 --> 33:01.379
KIM JORDAN: You are very close
to a perfect pour there.

33:01.379 --> 33:06.151
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this is economics
correspondent Paul Solman, long

33:06.151 --> 33:11.022
an enthusiast of worker
ownership, but only recently of
the perfect pour.

33:11.022 --> 33:15.961
KIM JORDAN: Cheers.

33:15.961 --> 33:22.234
PAUL SOLMAN: Cheers.

33:22.234 --> 33:29.507
GWEN IFILL: While the U.S.
debate over illegal immigration
rages on, for many Mexicans, the

33:29.507 --> 33:33.545
border dispute represents
a humanitarian crisis.

33:33.545 --> 33:38.683
On a recent trip to Mexico, Fred
de Sam Lazaro met a Catholic
priest who has made it his

33:38.683 --> 33:44.623
mission to protect those who
defy laws to make the journey to
and across the U.S. border.

33:44.623 --> 33:50.495
A version of this story aired on
the PBS program "Religion &
Ethics Newsweekly."

33:50.495 --> 33:58.737
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In the city
of Saltillo, thousands of rail
cars carry goods made in

33:58.737 --> 34:06.411
Mexico north to the U.S. They
also carry migrants from Central
America on their 1,100-mile
journey

34:06.411 --> 34:10.615
from Mexico's southern border.

34:10.615 --> 34:15.820
In Saltillo, most will hop off
for the final leg of their
journey north, trying to avoid

34:15.820 --> 34:22.560
detection not just by Mexican
and U.S. authorities, but also
criminal gangs. Many will take a

34:22.560 --> 34:30.635
brief respite at Casa del
Migrante, started by 72-year-old
Pedro Pantoja, a Jesuit priest.

34:30.635 --> 34:35.473
The migrants may be violating
the law, but Pantoja says his
primary responsibility is

34:35.473 --> 34:39.577
to be an advocate for people
in poverty and in danger.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.948
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA, Jesuit
Priest (through translator):
Every migrant is a potential

34:42.948 --> 34:48.520
kidnapping victim, and the
criminals extort up to $,5000 in
order to set them free.

34:48.520 --> 34:53.191
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: With
pressure and aid from the U.S.
government, Mexican authorities

34:53.191 --> 34:57.929
have been clamping down on
Central American migration and
the number of people making

34:57.929 --> 35:03.268
it as far north as the U.S.
border has dropped
significantly, but they haven't
stopped coming.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.972
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA (through
translator): These guys are
really tired. They just got here

35:06.972 --> 35:09.174
early this morning.

35:09.174 --> 35:13.812
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The new
arrivals eluded the Mexican
dragnet which deported 25,000

35:13.812 --> 35:21.019
Central Americans during the
first two months of 2015, twice
the number from a year earlier.

35:21.019 --> 35:25.724
Unaccompanied children,
thousands of whom were reaching
the U.S. in 2014, are now
intercepted

35:25.724 --> 35:28.093
long before they could
get this far north.

35:28.093 --> 35:31.396
I asked why they keep coming.

35:31.396 --> 35:36.401
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA (through
translator): The answer is what
one migrant said to me: "Yes,

35:36.401 --> 35:42.540
I fear organized crime, I fear
the police, but I fear hunger
even more, and violence."

35:42.540 --> 35:47.512
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many of the
mostly male migrants say they're
fleeing forceable recruitment

35:47.512 --> 35:52.751
into criminal gangs that now
dominate urban life in
Guatemala, Honduras, and El
Salvador,

35:52.751 --> 35:56.788
nations with the world's
highest homicide rates.

35:56.788 --> 36:01.059
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA (through
translator): They have young
gang members on every street
corner,

36:01.059 --> 36:04.662
and they know exactly who lives
in every house, who goes in and
out.

36:04.662 --> 36:09.300
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This
22-year-old, who wanted his
identity concealed to protect
family

36:09.300 --> 36:15.607
back home, escaped El Salvador,
but not Mexican authorities, who
intercepted him on a train

36:15.607 --> 36:20.512
ride with four fellow migrants.
The group wasn't arrested, but
they were instead stripped,

36:20.512 --> 36:24.749
forced into a nearby pond,
and robbed, he told me.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.920
MAN (through translator): They
took all of our money, our
phones, shoes, and they threw

36:28.920 --> 36:31.990
our clothes in the water.
They were laughing at us.

36:31.990 --> 36:38.763
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They found
refuge in a church and were sent
to a shelter.

36:38.763 --> 36:42.434
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA (through
translator): We get the details
of each person. This allows

36:42.434 --> 36:45.503
me to communicate with their
families if they get kidnapped,
if they die, if they end up

36:45.503 --> 36:48.807
in jail or get
lost on the route.

36:48.807 --> 36:54.212
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Santos was
being registered on this day.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.413
WOMAN (through translator):
From which country?

36:55.413 --> 36:57.315
SANTOS, Migrant: Honduras.

36:57.315 --> 37:00.685
WOMAN (through translator): And
a telephone number that we can
reach loved ones?

37:00.685 --> 37:05.657
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He's hoping
to return to Texas, where he
worked undocumented for

37:05.657 --> 37:10.295
years before a traffic stop led
to his deportation. He said
returning to the U.S. is much
harder

37:10.295 --> 37:15.300
now because gangs are bigger,
stronger, and more brutal.

37:15.300 --> 37:21.539
SANTOS (through translator): In
the '90s, you could easily
cross. Now they own the river.

37:21.539 --> 37:25.710
If they catch you, they'll beat
you up, even kill you. The only
way now is to find a good

37:25.710 --> 37:27.579
coyote.

37:27.579 --> 37:33.551
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Coyotes, or
traffickers, usually tied to
gangs, charge about $4,000,

37:33.551 --> 37:40.191
he says. Others put the price
tag much higher. There's no
guarantee, he says, and no
choice.

37:40.191 --> 37:45.864
SANTOS (through translator): The
situation in Honduras is that
for a 46-year-old, no

37:45.864 --> 37:51.102
one will give you a job in my
line of work, construction. If
you try to start your own

37:51.102 --> 37:55.340
business, no matter how small,
the gangs who would extort any
earnings.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.110
MAVER, Migrant (through
translator): My life was
threatened by the gangs because
I couldn't

37:59.110 --> 38:02.046
afford to pay the extortion.

38:02.046 --> 38:06.784
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Thirty-Six-year-old Maver also
fled Honduras, leaving behind
her small

38:06.784 --> 38:11.856
shop and two older children. She
brought her 3-year-old, Emily,
on a journey that turned

38:11.856 --> 38:16.761
from tiring to terrifying. Emily
was snatched from her by men
posing as good samaritans

38:16.761 --> 38:20.632
who had offered them a ride.

38:20.632 --> 38:26.004
MAVER (through translator): It
was about 3:30 in the morning.
It was really dark. That's

38:26.004 --> 38:29.941
when they came and took my
child. They shoved me to the
ground, took the child, and said

38:29.941 --> 38:33.978
I had to pay $10,000
to get her back.

38:33.978 --> 38:39.517
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sensing her
anguish, Mexican authorities
were sympathetic, she said, as

38:39.517 --> 38:45.190
were many strangers. In the end,
Emily was found in the custody
of child protection authorities,

38:45.190 --> 38:48.826
apparently turned over
by her kidnappers.

38:48.826 --> 38:54.999
MAVER (through translator): The
moment I lifted her up was the
happiest moment of my life,

38:54.999 --> 39:00.171
to hug her, to know she was
alive. Emily told me she was
very scared, kept saying, "Why

39:00.171 --> 39:04.275
did you leave me to travel by
myself? Why did you leave me
alone?"

39:04.275 --> 39:08.012
Now every time I hug her, I
tell her she's not alone.

39:08.012 --> 39:13.451
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Other
migrants say, the threat of
crime aside, the journey is
dangerous,

39:13.451 --> 39:17.021
getting a foot jammed between
train cars, for example. That's
what happened to 50-year-old

39:17.021 --> 39:18.957
Laura.

39:18.957 --> 39:25.496
LAURA, Migrant (through
translator): I thought I was
going to die, and all I kept
thinking

39:25.496 --> 39:30.201
was, let me die in a town so
they'll be able to identify me
and take me back to my family.

39:30.201 --> 39:35.406
And then I saw a man and shouted
for him, and he called the Red
Cross.

39:35.406 --> 39:40.111
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: After three
days in the hospital, she was
brought to the shelter.

39:40.111 --> 39:44.249
She will wait several months for
a prosthesis and rehab. After
that she plans to continue

39:44.249 --> 39:46.818
her journey north.

39:46.818 --> 39:52.724
LAURA (through translator): I
know it will be more difficult,
but what else can I do?

39:52.724 --> 39:56.461
I have to support a family, not
just my daughter, but I have
grandchildren. They don't even

39:56.461 --> 39:58.896
have a place to live.

39:58.896 --> 40:04.102
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She can stay
here for as long as she needs.
There are some 60 shelters

40:04.102 --> 40:07.839
along the migrant route in
Mexico, most run by Catholic
individuals and groups. Only
this

40:07.839 --> 40:11.009
one has no time limit.

40:11.009 --> 40:15.847
REV. PEDRO PANTOJA (through
translator): All people who come
here injured or hurt, they

40:15.847 --> 40:19.250
do not leave here until they're
completely recovered. They have
to leave here as persons

40:19.250 --> 40:27.925
who are free and with dignity.

40:27.925 --> 40:34.065
In Genesis Chapter 12, God
called Abraham to be a migrant.
In reality, we are all migrants.

40:34.065 --> 40:38.903
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For the
migrants here, the shelter helps
where it can for the onward

40:38.903 --> 40:45.310
journey. It helped Maver and
Emily get humanitarian visas to
legally be in Mexico. That will
allow

40:45.310 --> 40:52.717
them to make a much safer bus
journey to Texas, where they
will seek asylum.

40:52.717 --> 40:58.189
That's not an option for Santos,
who is preparing for the
perilous hike to the U.S.
border.

40:58.189 --> 41:02.660
His main task, finding a
trafficker with both a good
track record getting people
across

41:02.660 --> 41:08.333
and one willing to take most of
the payment once he's safely in
the U.S.

41:08.333 --> 41:13.805
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in Saltillo,
Mexico.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.842
GWEN IFILL: Fred's reporting is
a partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
Saint

41:17.842 --> 41:24.449
Mary's University of Minnesota.

41:24.449 --> 41:34.659
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, some seven
years after the housing crisis,
a look at what happened,

41:34.659 --> 41:39.030
how well the government fix
worked, and where are we now.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.767
All of that can be found in the
newest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.069
Jeffrey Brown has
our conversation.

41:45.069 --> 41:50.274
JEFFREY BROWN: In the world of
Fannie and Freddie, strange is
actually normal. That's

41:50.274 --> 41:55.880
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a
little understood, but hugely
important mortgage lending
institutions.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.851
And the line about how strange
they are comes from a new book
titled "Shaky Ground" that

41:59.851 --> 42:04.522
explores their role during and
since the 2008 financial
meltdown.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.192
Author Bethany McLean, a
contributing writer for "Vanity
Fair," joins me now.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.428
And welcome to you.

42:10.428 --> 42:14.265
I think we have to start by
reminding people what these
institutions do, because they
play

42:14.265 --> 42:16.634
very important roles.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.003
BETHANY MCLEAN, Author, "Shaky
Ground": And they're part of the
hidden machinery of our

42:19.003 --> 42:23.641
world, this critically important
stuff in the background that is
-- that makes up part

42:23.641 --> 42:26.244
of our existence, the lives of
almost every American, but we
don't realize it until there's

42:26.244 --> 42:28.946
a problem.

42:28.946 --> 42:34.018
Fannie Mae was created in the
wake of the Great Depression.
The idea was that if lenders

42:34.018 --> 42:38.222
could sell their loans, if banks
and other primary lenders could
make a mortgage and

42:38.222 --> 42:42.360
then sell it to another
institution, they'd be more
inclined to make that loan. And
that

42:42.360 --> 42:46.097
would help even out the flow of
mortgage credit and thus
increase the availability of
homeownership

42:46.097 --> 42:49.434
in this great, disparate,
diverse nation of ours.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.636
And that happened.

42:51.636 --> 42:56.207
JEFFREY BROWN: So, the old
mystery for many people is, what
are they? What are they doing?

42:56.207 --> 42:59.944
The latest, the new mystery
you're writing about is, why are
they still with us, right,

42:59.944 --> 43:03.848
after what happened? Tell us,
remind us sort of what happened
during the meltdown.

43:03.848 --> 43:08.252
BETHANY MCLEAN: So, in the 2008
financial crisis, the fear was
that Fannie and Freddie

43:08.252 --> 43:14.292
would go bankrupt. The
securities they create which are
backed by Americans' home
mortgages

43:14.292 --> 43:17.929
are -- they're immense. There
are over $5 trillion of them
outstanding, and they move

43:17.929 --> 43:21.799
through the global financial
system like water.

43:21.799 --> 43:26.003
So, the fear was that if these
two companies melted down, they
would take the global financial

43:26.003 --> 43:30.341
system with them. So, the U.S.
government put them in a state
known as conservatorship,

43:30.341 --> 43:33.778
where they were backed,
supported by a line of credit
from the U.S. Treasury and
managed,

43:33.778 --> 43:36.247
effectively, by a
government agency.

43:36.247 --> 43:40.785
And the idea was, the silver
lining in the financial crisis
was, we're going to rethink

43:40.785 --> 43:42.153
how we finance homeownership.
We're going to -- there's got to
be a better...

43:42.153 --> 43:42.720
(CROSSTALK)

43:42.720 --> 43:44.689
JEFFREY BROWN: A
silver lining, right.

43:44.689 --> 43:46.657
BETHANY MCLEAN: A silver lining.
We're going to come up with a
better way to do this. This

43:46.657 --> 43:49.660
thing called conservatorship
was supposed to be temporary.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.930
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, because, I
mean, these things are -- we
often refer to as
quasi-governmental,

43:52.930 --> 43:59.437
but what it came to look in, I
guess, reality is that the
private sector had the upside,

43:59.437 --> 44:02.974
where the public sector, the
rest of us, had the risk.

44:02.974 --> 44:07.178
BETHANY MCLEAN: The big source
of controversy about these
companies, President Obama
actually

44:07.178 --> 44:09.981
said it in a speech he gave
recently, saying these two
companies had to be abolished,
because

44:09.981 --> 44:13.885
it was, heads they win,
tails, taxpayers lose.

44:13.885 --> 44:17.221
And what he meant by that was
that, in good times, executives
and shareholders of these

44:17.221 --> 44:21.125
companies would make money, but,
in bad times, taxpayers would be
left holding the bag. And

44:21.125 --> 44:24.028
that is sort of how
it panned out.

44:24.028 --> 44:27.899
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, you
said -- as you said, they're in
conservatorship. There is

44:27.899 --> 44:32.670
an ongoing fight. We cover it
here occasionally as something
bubbles up, ongoing fight over

44:32.670 --> 44:33.571
what to do with it.

44:33.571 --> 44:35.840
BETHANY MCLEAN: What to do.

44:35.840 --> 44:39.744
And it's a huge question. It's
one that's important to every
American's lives. If you

44:39.744 --> 44:43.881
have a mortgage, the
availability of mortgage credit
helps dictate the terms on which
you

44:43.881 --> 44:47.051
get your mortgage. It's a
critical component in home
prices, which are the major
assets

44:47.051 --> 44:50.054
that most Americans have.

44:50.054 --> 44:55.026
Even if you don't have a
mortgage, these $5 trillion of
securities are out there, and

44:55.026 --> 44:58.996
they matter for every part of
the global financial market. So,
it's this critical, big issue,

44:58.996 --> 45:02.967
and we're not talking about it.
The companies sit in limbo seven
years after the financial

45:02.967 --> 45:07.038
crisis, and nobody seems
to know what to do.

45:07.038 --> 45:11.108
JEFFREY BROWN: And it involves
very big players. This is what
you were kind of look -- digging

45:11.108 --> 45:16.881
into it, because the investors
in it are major hedge funds,
foreign governments, including

45:16.881 --> 45:22.019
China and Japan. So, there's a
lot of consequences for what
happens or doesn't happen.

45:22.019 --> 45:27.525
BETHANY MCLEAN: The consequences
are huge to average homebuyers,
to investors everywhere.

45:27.525 --> 45:31.362
And you have this huge fight,
indeed, and almost paralysis,
because the government doesn't

45:31.362 --> 45:35.366
know what to do. The two
companies are intensely
controversial.

45:35.366 --> 45:41.872
And investors who bought the
remaining Fannie and Freddie
securities are now agitating for

45:41.872 --> 45:45.543
-- to get paid. So, you have all
these different very powerful
people fighting over the outcome

45:45.543 --> 45:47.878
of these two companies.

45:47.878 --> 45:51.515
JEFFREY BROWN: And if it were to
be abolished, which is a -- if
they were to be abolished,

45:51.515 --> 45:54.852
which is possible, there is
still that argument about the
historic role where you started

45:54.852 --> 45:57.088
about allowing affordable
housing for so many people.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.123
BETHANY MCLEAN: Right.

45:59.123 --> 46:02.259
I don't think they will be
abolished, and I have actually
come to the point of view

46:02.259 --> 46:06.764
that I'm not sure they should
be. In the wake of the financial
crisis, were it not for Fannie

46:06.764 --> 46:10.835
and Freddie, the mortgage market
would have completely shut down.

46:10.835 --> 46:16.440
You can no longer say that these
two companies are unnecessary. I
think -- I think it's -- I

46:16.440 --> 46:21.112
think that's part of the
problem. Many people believe
that without Fannie and Freddie,
the

46:21.112 --> 46:24.849
30-year-fixed rate, fully
pre-payable mortgage, which is
this fixture of American life --
I

46:24.849 --> 46:28.252
think over 80 percent of the
people who got a mortgage in the
last six months took out

46:28.252 --> 46:31.856
this kind of mortgage -- without
Fannie or Freddie or some kind
of government backstop,

46:31.856 --> 46:33.991
this type of mortgage
wouldn't exist.

46:33.991 --> 46:36.794
It would be a radically
different housing market. Are we
prepared for that? I don't

46:36.794 --> 46:38.763
know.

46:38.763 --> 46:44.001
JEFFREY BROWN: You have written
about Enron. You looked at the
financial crisis. When you

46:44.001 --> 46:48.172
looked at these two
institutions, even as somebody
who is used to looking at this
kind

46:48.172 --> 46:50.708
of thing, were there surprises?

46:50.708 --> 46:54.278
BETHANY MCLEAN: I think it's --
I think it's incredibly
surprising. I think it's really

46:54.278 --> 46:58.582
weird that you have this most
domestic of assets possible, a
home, financed by foreign

46:58.582 --> 47:00.084
central banks, a home in
Kansas that was financed by...

47:00.084 --> 47:00.384
(CROSSTALK)

47:00.384 --> 47:01.819
BETHANY MCLEAN: ... in China.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.221
JEFFREY BROWN: We just don't
think about it, right, as we're
thinking about that loan.

47:04.221 --> 47:07.792
BETHANY MCLEAN: We just don't
think about it, the fact that,
since the financial crisis,

47:07.792 --> 47:10.394
the hue and cry has been, more
capital, give banks more capital
and the financial system

47:10.394 --> 47:12.663
will be safer.

47:12.663 --> 47:17.201
Fannie and Freddie, with their
over $5 trillion of securities
outstanding, are operating on

47:17.201 --> 47:21.972
next to no capital. If there is
a sudden shock to the system, if
interest rates go up, if

47:21.972 --> 47:25.142
they suffer a loss, taxpayers
will have to foot the bill
again. And yet...

47:25.142 --> 47:27.478
JEFFREY BROWN: So, that
risk is still there.

47:27.478 --> 47:31.716
BETHANY MCLEAN: That risk is
still there, and is a total
example of government
dysfunction,

47:31.716 --> 47:35.886
that we have had seven years to
figure out this problem, and we
have done nothing.

47:35.886 --> 47:39.290
JEFFREY BROWN: And do you --
and, briefly, do you expect some
resolution? You're laughing

47:39.290 --> 47:40.991
as I say it. It sounds like no.

47:40.991 --> 47:43.227
BETHANY MCLEAN: I'm
laughing as you say it.

47:43.227 --> 47:47.465
There is a big fight over this
notion, should we have the
government in the housing market

47:47.465 --> 47:51.802
or not? Should we just get the
government out and let private
capital, if you consider

47:51.802 --> 47:55.306
big banks to be private capital,
finance the housing market? What
would the mortgage market

47:55.306 --> 48:00.111
look like without that? And how
do we -- how do we move forward?

48:00.111 --> 48:03.614
And the investors, the big hedge
funds who have taken stakes in
Fannie and Freddie, are

48:03.614 --> 48:07.151
-- have points of view on this,
too, and are big players in the
debate.

48:07.151 --> 48:09.420
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, "Shaky
Ground: The Strange Saga of the
U.S. Mortgage Giants.

48:09.420 --> 48:12.556
Bethany McLean,
thank you so much.

48:12.556 --> 48:22.600
BETHANY MCLEAN:
Thank you so much.

48:22.600 --> 48:29.974
GWEN IFILL: Violence in urban
areas is nothing new, but one
doesn't have to be targeted to

48:29.974 --> 48:35.279
become the victim of gun
violence. Two years ago, 11 year
old Tayloni Mazyck was shot and

48:35.279 --> 48:40.117
paralyzed by a stray bullet near
her home in Brooklyn, New York.

48:40.117 --> 48:44.622
Filmmaker Shiho Fukada followed
Tayloni's recovery, focused --
focusing on how her devoted

48:44.622 --> 48:48.392
mother, a single parent,
coped with the tragedy.

48:48.392 --> 48:51.529
The result was a New York
Times film, "Stray Bullet."

48:51.529 --> 48:55.766
PRISCILLA SAMUEL, Mother of
Tayloni Mazyck: When she had
dreams about her being shot,

48:55.766 --> 49:02.306
or when she hears loud noises,
she gets panic attacks.

49:02.306 --> 49:18.055
I have run up in there and her
heart be racing. She was like:
"I can't deal with this. I can't

49:18.055 --> 49:21.058
do this. I can't do this."

49:21.058 --> 49:26.230
Then she starts saying, "I
should have ducked down and laid
on the floor." She keeps saying

49:26.230 --> 49:36.473
what she should have did, what
she should have did, what she
should have did.

49:36.473 --> 49:43.714
He's 17 years old. His life is
over. Just like my life is over,
her life is, his life

49:43.714 --> 49:53.190
is over, too.

49:53.190 --> 50:05.102
But I can't hold all that,
because I got enough going on.
So, I have to be able to
function

50:05.102 --> 50:09.406
and do what I got to do for her,
and by me holding that
resentment is going to stop me

50:09.406 --> 50:11.508
from moving forward.

50:11.508 --> 50:17.348
TAYLONI MAZYCK, Gun Violence
Victim: Got to wash my hair.

50:17.348 --> 50:23.387
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: We have
got to wash that, too.

50:23.387 --> 50:25.356
And I get a little depressed
because it's like I don't even
have a life. She's my daughter,

50:25.356 --> 50:29.627
my husband and everything all in
one. I have to do everything.
Mostly everything is on

50:29.627 --> 50:30.294
me.

50:30.294 --> 50:32.863
Don't -- don't move.

50:32.863 --> 50:37.368
And that puts a toll on me,
because Tayloni doesn't let me
breathe.

50:37.368 --> 50:40.137
You just complain
about everything.

50:40.137 --> 50:44.975
TAYLONI MAZYCK: Because it
hurts. What else you want me to
say? Ooh, that felt good?

50:44.975 --> 50:48.545
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: How do washing
your face -- how does washing
your face hurt?

50:48.545 --> 50:50.381
TAYLONI MAZYCK: You was washing
my neck, and that hurts.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.448
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: OK. All right.

50:51.448 --> 50:54.351
Tayloni gets very frustrated
because she can't just get up
and do it herself.

50:54.351 --> 50:57.321
TAYLONI MAZYCK: Mommy, hurry up.

50:57.321 --> 51:00.357
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: Everything is,
"Mommy, mommy, mommy."
Sometimes, I hear her calling me
in

51:00.357 --> 51:04.094
my sleep, and she
don't be calling me.

51:04.094 --> 51:08.699
AL SHARPTON, Civil Rights
Activist: What do we want?

51:08.699 --> 51:09.900
AUDIENCE: Justice!

51:09.900 --> 51:12.369
AL SHARPTON: What do we want?

51:12.369 --> 51:13.470
AUDIENCE: Justice!

51:13.470 --> 51:15.205
AL SHARPTON: When do we want it?

51:15.205 --> 51:16.774
AUDIENCE: Now!

51:16.774 --> 51:19.376
AL SHARPTON: We rally against
violence in our community. We
have this morning two young

51:19.376 --> 51:27.451
people that this organization
stood with, and we're glad that
they are here to be with

51:27.451 --> 51:34.892
us, Tayloni, who was shot in
Brooklyn and paralyzed. Tayloni,
she's here today.

51:34.892 --> 51:37.027
Bring her up.

51:37.027 --> 51:38.762
(APPLAUSE)

51:38.762 --> 51:46.770
AL SHARPTON: You made it
through. Here's our gun violence
for you.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.472
(SINGING)

51:48.472 --> 51:57.681
TAYLONI MAZYCK: Jerry (ph), why
are you in my room? Go away.

51:57.681 --> 52:06.957
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: You better
stop, because, one day, it might
be him doing this.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.325
(CROSSTALK)

52:08.325 --> 52:12.796
PRISCILLA SAMUEL:
So, you never know.

52:12.796 --> 52:19.536
TAYLONI MAZYCK: I'm be
walking by that time.

52:19.536 --> 52:28.345
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: I encourage
her to walk again. You believe
you can walk, then ask

52:28.345 --> 52:30.948
God to help you walk again, and
you're going to walk again.
That's it, because nobody else

52:30.948 --> 52:32.016
can tell you different.

52:32.016 --> 52:34.251
TAYLONI MAZYCK: Please.

52:34.251 --> 52:37.154
Jerry, I'm going to walk. I'm
going to walk before that. When
I walk, that means I'm going

52:37.154 --> 52:45.062
to run, so I can catch you.

52:45.062 --> 52:56.073
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: I'm just glad
she's still here. That's all I
got to say.

52:56.073 --> 52:58.675
(LAUGHTER)

52:58.675 --> 53:07.618
PRISCILLA SAMUEL: She says she
wants to be a doctor or a
lawyer. I want her to be the

53:07.618 --> 53:13.624
best that she can be.
That's what she has to do.

53:13.624 --> 53:21.331
GWEN IFILL: You can watch more

53:24.735 --> 53:32.910
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a news
update before we go.

53:32.910 --> 53:38.282
Republican Congressman Paul Ryan
of Wisconsin has formally
declared his candidacy for the

53:38.282 --> 53:42.619
speaker of the House of
Representatives. In a letter to
colleagues, he said -- quote --
"Now

53:42.619 --> 53:46.290
we have an opportunity to turn
the page, to start with a clean
slate." The vote will take

53:46.290 --> 53:48.792
place next week.
