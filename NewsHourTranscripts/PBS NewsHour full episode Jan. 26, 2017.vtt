JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And I'm Antonio
Mora.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.376 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: Such a meeting would be
fruitless,

00:11.812 --> 00:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I want to go a different
route.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Border tensions
build.

00:15.983 --> 00:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As President Trump pushes to
build the wall,
Mexico's president cancels a
meeting at the

00:21.388 --> 00:23.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Also ahead this
Thursday, Judy
sits down with senior Trump
adviser Kellyanne

00:26.159 --> 00:28.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Conway to look at the
president's first week
in office.

00:28.862 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And aging out of
the middle
class, the second part of our
look at the

00:33.166 --> 00:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing group of Americans
suddenly finding
themselves in financial straits.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI, The New
School for Social
Research: Over half of people
who are working

00:40.774 --> 00:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now and over 50 have nothing for
retirement
savings.

00:46.013 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will only have Social
Security to rely
on.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.619 --> 00:57.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.157 --> 01:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

01:07.034 --> 01:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're having guests join me here
at the "NewsHour"
anchor desk in the coming weeks.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, it's journalist Antonio
Mora.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Antonio.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Thank you, Judy.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an honor to be here.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're glad to
have you.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, our top story tonight:
President Trump's
push for a wall on the border
with Mexico

01:22.582 --> 01:27.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has opened a diplomatic rift,
and it raises
the prospect of a major new tax.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: The president of Mexico
and myself

01:33.593 --> 01:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have agreed to cancel our
planned meeting
scheduled for next week.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was the
president's
version of events today.

01:41.168 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours earlier, Mexican President
Enrique Pena
Nieto canceled his scheduled
visit to Washington.

01:47.140 --> 01:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd come under heavy political
pressure at
home after Mr. Trump signed an
executive order

01:51.912 --> 01:57.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Wednesday to start work on a
border wall,
and insisted again that Mexico
will ultimately

01:57.751 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay for it.

01:59.586 --> 02:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the president gave no
ground at the
congressional Republican retreat
in Philadelphia.

02:03.457 --> 02:10.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Unless Mexico is
going to treat
the United States fairly, with
respect, such

02:10.497 --> 02:16.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a meeting would be fruitless,
and I want to
go a different route.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have no choice.

02:18.271 --> 02:22.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: He also
repeated calls to
bolster deportation forces and
eliminate refuges

02:22.909 --> 02:24.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the undocumented.

02:24.745 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: From day one, I
have said it,
and I mean the immediate removal
of criminal

02:29.950 --> 02:30.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aliens.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to be gone fast.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:35.122 --> 02:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And, finally, at
long last cracking
down on sanctuary cities.

02:42.763 --> 02:47.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Outside,
protesters swarmed
the area, opposing the
president's policies

02:48.001 --> 02:50.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on immigration and other issues.

02:50.203 --> 02:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell
said Congress is prepared to
foot the bill

02:54.875 --> 02:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for building the border wall, at
least for
now.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We
are moving ahead.

03:00.547 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the speaker pointed out to
our group yesterday,
with, roughly -- yes roughly $12
billion to

03:07.954 --> 03:08.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$15 billion.

03:09.022 --> 03:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we intend to address the wall
issue ourselves.

03:13.326 --> 03:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president can deal with
his relations
with other countries on that
issue and other

03:20.600 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later, en route
back to Washington,
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer said the

03:25.672 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president wants a 20 percent tax
on all imports
from Mexico.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
By doing it that way, we can do
$10 billion

03:31.678 --> 03:34.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year and easily pay for the
wall just through
that mechanism alone.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But a short
time later, Spicer
said that's just one option.

03:38.919 --> 03:43.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, some
Republicans, like Illinois
Congressman Adam Kinzinger, say
the country

03:43.890 --> 03:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still needs a comprehensive
immigration policy.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER (R), Illinois:
How do we fix
our immigration system so that
in 20, 30 years,

03:50.931 --> 03:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're not back here again?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how do we deal with the
folks that are
here?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to round up and
deport 15
million people.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to have some kind of a
pathway to
legalization.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's unease
with some
of President Trump's other
pronouncements

04:02.175 --> 04:03.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

04:03.844 --> 04:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed
back today
against Mr. Trump's assertion to
ABC News

04:07.647 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that torture works.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:10.050 --> 04:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: And
torture is illegal.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And torture is not legal.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we agree with it not being
legal.

04:14.454 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Trump did
say he'd defer
his CIA director and incoming
secretary of

04:19.693 --> 04:25.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense, both of whom have said
they oppose
a return to water-boarding in
particular.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump returned to
Washington
this afternoon, ending his first
day on Air

04:29.903 --> 04:31.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Force One.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us
now.

04:33.807 --> 04:39.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Lisa, what are the
Republican members
saying about this White House
talk of an import

04:39.646 --> 04:41.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax on Mexican goods?

04:41.982 --> 04:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: First of all,
they are trying
to get their hands around
exactly what the

04:45.819 --> 04:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president is proposing here.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear from the House speaker's
office that
they believe this is a reference
to the plan

04:51.892 --> 04:56.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Republicans laid out last
year called
the Border Adjustability Tax,
and something

04:56.963 --> 04:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're going to talk a
lot about in
the coming months.

04:59.232 --> 05:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, basically, it is a 20
percent tax not
just on Mexico, but basically on
all imports

05:04.104 --> 05:05.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into this country.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would change dramatically how
this country
deals with imports and exports.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In affects almost every business
in this country,
a very big deal.

05:12.212 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Republicans now are trying
to parse out
whether the president is
specifically proposing

05:18.251 --> 05:20.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this, whether it's one idea.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exactly what Sean Spicer meant
is still up
in the air at this hour.

05:23.790 --> 05:27.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But House Republicans are hoping
that the
president is full force behind
this plan.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They like it.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not everyone does.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that we're going
to have to
pay a lot of attention to.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That is for sure.

05:33.733 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, as you look back on
the two days
of this conference, what was
actually accomplished?

05:39.005 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Overall, Judy,
the bottom
line here is a timeline.

05:44.411 --> 05:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House Republicans have laid
out, specifically
the House, a 200-day agenda.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what does that mean?

05:51.051 --> 05:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That really means that, by
August, they want
to have in their hands concrete
proposals

05:55.755 --> 06:00.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for how they will replace
Obamacare and how
they will repeal the tax code.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, what does that mean?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does that mean they will pass
something by
then?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one's exactly clear.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they want to have those
proposals in hand
by August, and Speaker Ryan
today said they

06:09.069 --> 06:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want everything passed by the
end of the year.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are ambitious goals.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The timeline is what we have.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have the details of the
plans.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what they will be doing
for the next
coming months.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Lisa,
what are members,
one by one, what are they
telling you in terms

06:22.515 --> 06:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of whether they think that can
happen?

06:24.784 --> 06:31.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There are some
nervous members,
because, in addition to these
very large plans,

06:31.091 --> 06:35.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obamacare and tax reform, they
also have some
things that have tripped up
Republicans in

06:35.128 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past, like the debt ceiling,
which will
come due shortly, and also
another government

06:40.233 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending bill.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Those are things that
Republicans have had
trouble with in their own
conference and they

06:44.671 --> 06:46.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take a lot of time.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, Judy, they do not
have 60 votes
in the Senate, and I have spoken
to several

06:49.809 --> 06:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans today who say, we
need to be realistic
about that.

06:53.113 --> 06:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't push for everything we
want and expect
it, because we know that Senate
Democrats

06:57.484 --> 06:58.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are going to oppose us.

06:58.952 --> 07:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to be sober, in the
words of one Republican
I talked to today.

07:03.823 --> 07:07.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
reporting
from the Republican
congressional retreat

07:07.894 --> 07:10.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there in Philadelphia, thank
you.

07:10.163 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear from a senior White
House adviser
right after the news summary.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: In the day's other
news: Russia
warned President Trump to think
twice about

07:18.838 --> 07:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
setting up safe zones for
refugees inside
Syria.

07:22.475 --> 07:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president confirmed in his
ABC interview
that he favors the idea, but he
gave no specifics.

07:27.213 --> 07:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a Kremlin spokesman
warned the U.S.
should thoroughly calculate all
possible consequences

07:33.620 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before doing anything.

07:35.355 --> 07:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, rebels in Syria say
they want to
see action, not just words.

07:39.225 --> 07:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: British Prime
Minister Theresa
May is talking up cooperation
with the new

07:43.530 --> 07:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump administration on her
first visit to
the U.S. as prime minister.

07:48.401 --> 07:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She addressed the Republican
retreat today
and drew parallels between the
GOP's victory

07:53.807 --> 07:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last November and Britain's vote
to leave
the European Union.

07:57.444 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: As we
rediscover our confidence
together, as you

08:01.648 --> 08:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renew your nation, just as we
renew ours,
we have the opportunity, indeed
the responsibility,

08:10.156 --> 08:14.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to renew the special
relationship for this
new age.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have the opportunity to lead
together again.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: May is set to
meet with President
Trump at the White House
tomorrow.

08:21.668 --> 08:26.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Cheers erupted in
the West African
nation of Gambia today as the
new president

08:26.139 --> 08:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
returned home, following a
political crisis.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Adama Barrow was
welcomed by thousands
of supporters.

08:32.579 --> 08:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had waited until longtime
ruler Yahya Jammeh
finally left, and West African
military forces

08:38.718 --> 08:40.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secured the country.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barrow is Gambia's first new
president in
two decades.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's promised to reverse
Jammeh's authoritarian
policies.

08:46.693 --> 08:51.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Australia,
celebrations
and protests competed as the
country marked

08:51.431 --> 08:53.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Australia Day.

08:53.233 --> 08:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the anniversary of the
first British
colonists arriving in Sydney
Harbor in 1788.

08:59.239 --> 09:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Aborigines, though, now
call it Invasion
Day, and thousands protested in
major cities.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some staged a sit-in at the
Parliament House
in Canberra.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Wall Street took a
bit of a
pause today, 24 hours after
reaching a major

09:12.218 --> 09:13.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
milestone.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 32
points to close at 20100.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It cracked the 20000 barrier for
the first
time yesterday.

09:21.327 --> 09:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Nasdaq fell one point
today, and so
did the S&amp;P 500.

09:26.599 --> 09:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Judy talks
to the president's senior
counselor, Kellyanne

09:30.136 --> 09:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conway; what President Trump's
latest actions
on immigration mean for the
United States'

09:34.741 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship with Mexico; also,
people who
appear middle class, but are on
the edge of

09:40.146 --> 09:50.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
financial ruin; and much more.

09:50.190 --> 09:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
financial ruin; and much more.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now for a view from inside the
White House
of the Trump administration's
first days in

09:59.899 --> 10:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office, I'm joined by Kellyanne
Conway, counselor
to the president.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway, welcome back
to the program.

10:06.573 --> 10:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to start with the fact
that this
administration is not even a
week old, and,

10:11.010 --> 10:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already, the president of Mexico
has canceled
a visit he was going to make
next week, saying

10:15.815 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not going to pay for this
border wall.

10:18.485 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the way the president
wanted to have
a relationship between the U.S.
and Mexico

10:23.690 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as his administration gets under
way?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: As
President Trump said today in
Philadelphia

10:27.861 --> 10:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he addressed the House
Senate Republican
Conference at their retreat,
Judy, it was

10:31.965 --> 10:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a mutual decision to postpone
this trip.

10:34.701 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that when these two
leaders are
ready to sit down and talk about
a wide range

10:39.005 --> 10:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of issues, they will do that.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's look at the rest of
the week.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this has been a pretty
remarkable
week in just four work days.

10:45.512 --> 10:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had wage-boosting,
job-creating measures.

10:49.582 --> 10:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had manufacturing CEOs
from all over
the country here, really premier
job creators,

10:55.121 --> 11:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hearkening the -- really heeding
the president's
call to try to have an explosion
in manufacturing

11:00.460 --> 11:02.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our nation.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then on the very same day,
we had the
labor union leaders, along with
laborers themselves

11:05.999 --> 11:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here at the White House, talking
about what
it means for them be a
carpenter, a pipe fitter,

11:10.770 --> 11:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a plumber, a steelworker, like
the many men
I grew up with in South Jersey
outside of

11:15.308 --> 11:17.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Philadelphia.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said that they had
never been invited
to the White House before,
Democratic or Republican.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They felt so included that
they're part of
the national conversation.

11:22.982 --> 11:27.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president has issued
executive orders
withdrawing from the TPP, so
that we have

11:27.620 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bilateral trade agreements in
the future that
benefit the United States and
its workers

11:32.091 --> 11:33.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and its allies and its
interests.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's been a very busy week.

11:35.128 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're very happy to have our
first foreign
leader tomorrow, Prime Minister
Theresa May,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, meeting with President
Trump.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Kellyanne,
let me -- if
I may interrupt.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:44.337 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: And we're very
happy about
that.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want to ask you about some
of these things,
but sticking with the Mexico
story, because

11:48.908 --> 11:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president of Mexico said it
was his decision
not to come.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I want to ask you about
is the border
wall and paying for it.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had the White House press
secretary tell
reporters today that it was
going to be paid

11:59.385 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for with a 20 percent tax
imposed on Mexican
goods coming into the U.S.

12:04.357 --> 12:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, later, the White House said
that was
just one idea.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: That's right.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Which is it?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: That's right.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is one of the many methods
by which to
pay for the wall.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is one proposal on the table.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Certainly, there are others.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, when you consider the
price tag
for this wall, which will be a
physical wall

12:19.772 --> 12:24.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constructed on the southern
border, let's
contrast that to the billions
and billions

12:24.210 --> 12:28.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we spend on benefits for
and accommodating
illegal immigrants.

12:28.514 --> 12:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we -- this country spends
billions of
dollars protecting the borders
of other countries

12:32.952 --> 12:33.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's high time we start
protecting our own.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're a sovereign nation.

12:37.523 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as President Trump has said
all along,
made a centerpiece of his
campaign from day

12:41.094 --> 12:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, we have to stop the flow of
people and
drugs over our borders.

12:45.732 --> 12:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he also did, by the way,
these executive
orders this week, in terms of
building the

12:50.103 --> 12:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall, was, he has expanded the
tools and the
resources that our law
enforcement officials

12:55.274 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our brave men and women who
are protecting
that border.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need tools and resources
and they should
be respected.

13:01.147 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The detention areas will be
larger to accommodate
those and stop this catch and
release, stop

13:05.451 --> 13:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the sanctuary city funding.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If I can just
interrupt, because
-- and I hate to do that, but I
-- because

13:09.355 --> 13:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a number of things I want
to ask you
about.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We did report on all that last
night.

13:12.959 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the other thing the
president did yesterday,
in addition to make the
announcement you just

13:18.398 --> 13:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussed, is he talked about
the sanctuary
cities, so-called sanctuary
cities, where

13:24.370 --> 13:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undocumented immigrants are
given a different,
a fairer treatment in the eyes
of many.

13:30.543 --> 13:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we have seen 100 American
mayors say
they are not going to go along
with what the

13:36.449 --> 13:38.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president said.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With that kind of pushback, how
is the president
going to force these mayors, who
are saying

13:42.522 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is an inhumane way to treat
people who
are here in this country as
visitors?

13:47.326 --> 13:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: This issue of
sanctuary
cities goes to the heart of how
Donald Trump

13:51.464 --> 13:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself has changed the whole
way many Americans
look at illegal immigration.

13:56.202 --> 14:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, the question of
fairness in illegal
immigration went to one issue:
What's fair

14:00.873 --> 14:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the illegal immigrant?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now people are asking,
what's fair to
the rest us of us?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's fair to the American
worker?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's fair to the safety and
sanctity of
people who live in some of these
sanctuary

14:09.849 --> 14:10.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cities?

14:10.850 --> 14:11.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's fair to Kate Steinle?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That woman should be a household
name.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She should be known as a
national treasure,
this woman who was murdered in
cold blood

14:16.823 --> 14:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in front of her father in San
Francisco by
an illegal immigrant who had
been deported

14:21.260 --> 14:22.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
five times, Judy.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's humane treatment of whom?
Kate Steinle?

14:25.331 --> 14:26.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:26.332 --> 14:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No, and I hear
you.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the president has spoken of
her often.

14:29.068 --> 14:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how will the president force
mayors who
are saying they are going to
take care of

14:33.506 --> 14:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undocumented immigrants if they
come into
their cities, because, frankly,
they say the

14:38.611 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea that most immigrants are
committing crimes
is just not true?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, that is
not what the
president said.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're -- now we're conflating
two different
things.

14:46.085 --> 14:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one said that in terms of the
sanctuary
cities defunding.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The -- I guess those mayors will
have to find
money somewhere else, because
they love when

14:54.327 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money flows from the federal
government
here in Washington.

14:57.063 --> 15:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they want to continue to
flout and
flagrantly violate the law and
brag about

15:01.801 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it today publicly, then they
should go ahead.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're going to have it
find their own
money in doing so.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And perhaps if they are
violating the law,
then we will see what happens in
the future.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But...

15:11.911 --> 15:13.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

15:13.679 --> 15:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: ... until then
-- you know,
but, Judy, this is -- I hear
undocumented

15:16.816 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants and I hear about say
-- again,
what is fair to everyone, the
people, the

15:21.354 --> 15:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legal people, the American
citizens who live
there, our law enforcement who
feels like

15:24.557 --> 15:28.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they don't have all the
resources and tools
they need, and then, of course,
our employment

15:28.895 --> 15:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
base where people are saying...

15:29.996 --> 15:30.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:30.997 --> 15:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm going to...

15:32.131 --> 15:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: People are
tired of hearing
that...

15:32.999 --> 15:34.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:34.400 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: ... here to do
the jobs
Americans don't want to do.

15:35.535 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm going to
interrupt you
again.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I apologize for continuing to
interrupt, but
I do want to move on.

15:39.205 --> 15:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, the president said in an
interview
yesterday he wants to create
safe zones for

15:43.609 --> 15:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the people living in Syria.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wouldn't this require U.S.
troops?

15:48.414 --> 15:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And has he discussed it with the
senior national
security members of his
administration?

15:53.853 --> 15:58.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: He has
discussed Syria in
that regard with his national
security team.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his national security and
intelligence
teams are being -- still being
formed, as

16:01.794 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know.

16:03.563 --> 16:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Mattis will be, we hope,
confirmed
or sworn in -- excuse me --
sworn in on the

16:07.066 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next day or so.

16:08.534 --> 16:12.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, of course, we have
Secretary Kelly now
and the CIA director also.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the thing is, he will meet
with them.

16:14.173 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he has been -- just
President Trump has
been very public about the fact
that Aleppo

16:18.177 --> 16:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a humanitarian crisis that's
been all but
ignored by this country for far
long.

16:23.850 --> 16:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he will meet with them and
he will make
final decisions, but he's been
very public,

16:28.020 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including on a different network
last night,
Judy, about what options are
very much on

16:32.491 --> 16:34.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the table.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And -- but not
exactly in connection
with that, but the president has
also spoken

16:37.763 --> 16:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the prospect of torture,
of enhanced
interrogation.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that it's something that
he likes.

16:45.271 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also saw yesterday, Kellyanne
Conway, a
draft executive order reported
on that raises

16:51.277 --> 16:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the prospect of reviving these
CIA so-called
black site prisons, where we
know terrorism

16:56.716 --> 16:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspects were once detained and
tortured.

16:59.385 --> 17:04.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I want to ask you about a
story in The
New York Times today, because
the press secretary,

17:04.357 --> 17:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer, said this is not --
this draft
order didn't come from the
United -- from

17:08.828 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

17:10.630 --> 17:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But The New York Times quotes
three different
individuals who say that it did
come from

17:15.434 --> 17:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the White House, from the
National Security
Council office.

17:17.904 --> 17:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess my question is, why
doesn't the
White House simply acknowledge
that this is

17:22.508 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where it came from?

17:23.509 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Because it
didn't.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not an official White
House document,
period, as I have been told.

17:28.547 --> 17:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it came if it came from
the NSC, if
it came from others who are
leaking documents,

17:34.453 --> 17:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it certainly is not -- that is
not a White
House document that has been
discussed internally.

17:38.024 --> 17:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what the press secretary has
said is true,
as far as I have been briefed.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, both...

17:43.329 --> 17:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: On the broader
issue of
torture, though, it's important,
because I

17:45.598 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
think you said that the
president said he
likes it.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he said is that he has been
informed
by people very recently that it
is a possible

17:52.738 --> 17:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- a possibility that works.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have other people, like his
incoming secretary
of defense, who said that he
doesn't believe

17:59.412 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it works, that there are other
tactics...

18:01.480 --> 18:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And both...

18:02.581 --> 18:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: ... that could
work just
as well.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he will meet with his team
and make a final
decision on that.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And both the
defense secretary
and the CIA director said that
they had never

18:07.820 --> 18:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen this draft order, until it
was reported
in the press.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, that's
why.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it were a White House
document, they
certainly would have, because
they are the

18:14.927 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary of -- his secretary of
defense and
his CIA director.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So that helps answer the
question as well.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A few...

18:23.202 --> 18:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: We know there
are lots of
leaks everywhere.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's nothing we can do about
that, except
not leak ourselves.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A very few quick
questions
I'm just going to ask you one
right after

18:29.608 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the other.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This investigation into what the
president
calls widespread voter fraud, no
credible

18:34.814 --> 18:36.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evidence of this.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has anyone on the White House
staff tried
to talk the president out of
doing this?

18:39.352 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, I won't
reveal private
conversations with the
president, Judy, but

18:42.254 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will tell you that what the
president is
talking about is registration
and voter rolls.

18:46.892 --> 18:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knows there are dead people
registered,
there are illegal people
registered, and he

18:50.262 --> 18:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to get to the bottom of
that without
an election on the horizon.

18:53.232 --> 18:58.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Usually, people get all
exercised about electoral
reform after something goes
wrong or ballot

18:58.904 --> 19:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
integrity when we're about to
have an election.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's great that, right after
a successful
election that he had, unexpected
to most in

19:05.578 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the media, that he is looking at
ballot integrity,
one person, one vote, really the
bedrock of

19:10.483 --> 19:11.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our democracy.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what he's talking
about.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have discussed with him as
recently as today.

19:14.787 --> 19:15.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:15.788 --> 19:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, pardon me.

19:17.590 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's no evidence of
widespread voter
fraud, couldn't this end up just
like President

19:21.527 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's longtime claim that
President Obama
was born outside the United
States?

19:25.664 --> 19:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: No, I can't
imagine why
that would ever be raised on the
same plane.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But let me say this.

19:31.637 --> 19:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were those same words used by
anyone to describe
Jill Stein and her fantasy of a
recount based

19:38.577 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on -- quote -- "voter fraud"
that she detected
in Wisconsin and Michigan that
ended up getting

19:42.882 --> 19:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her millions of dollars in
taxpayer -- taxpayer
dollars and a lot of platform by
the media,

19:48.921 --> 19:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
perhaps even on your network?

19:50.890 --> 19:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somehow, that was a great idea
by Jill Stein
for 70,000 votes, because they
didn't want

19:56.162 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to accept the election results
that they didn't
expect, and they wouldn't
accept.

19:59.732 --> 20:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I just have to say the
president is talking
about registration and voter
rolls.

20:04.804 --> 20:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think anybody can
deny that there
are people who are registered to
vote, there

20:08.374 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are people registered to vote in
different
states, there are people who are
ineligible

20:11.377 --> 20:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote either because they're
dead and shouldn't
vote or they are illegal and
shouldn't be

20:16.449 --> 20:17.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
registered to vote.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:18.451 --> 20:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned the
media.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the president has been
engaged in,
I don't know of any other way to
put it, than

20:22.021 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long-running battle with the
media, has
been very critical of much, if
not most of

20:27.726 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the news media.

20:29.695 --> 20:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, in The New York
Times, it's running
a story, your colleague the
White House chief

20:35.434 --> 20:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategist, Steve Bannon, said
-- told The
New York Times last night, he
said the media

20:40.372 --> 20:45.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- quote -- in his words,
"the opposition
party," and that it should --
quote -- "keep

20:45.578 --> 20:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its mouth shut and just listen
for a while."

20:48.347 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does the president share that
view?

20:50.149 --> 20:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, there
are other things
Steve Bannon said in that
interview in The

20:52.718 --> 20:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York Times, very rare
interview.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about
that quote?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, what --
what -- let's
talk about what he meant there.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he is saying there is,
there's no evidence
that anybody in the media
learned anything

21:01.727 --> 21:02.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from this election.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no head that's rolled.

21:04.964 --> 21:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no division that said,
wow, we really
screwed this up by stating as
fact that Hillary

21:10.369 --> 21:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was going to win, and
that she was
going to take the House and the
Senate with

21:14.039 --> 21:15.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:16.976 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in all
fairness, Kellyanne
Conway, most people we know in
the Republican

21:18.777 --> 21:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Democratic parties looked at
the public
opinion polls, and thought that
that was going

21:22.715 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be the outcome.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, not in
the Trump campaign,
or we wouldn't have been sending
him to Michigan,

21:27.453 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wisconsin, certainly back to
North Carolina,
Pennsylvania.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had him in Pennsylvania three
times a week.

21:32.358 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we must have seen something
that allowed
to us influence the calendar
where we were

21:36.462 --> 21:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deploying our two greatest
assets, Mike Pence
and Donald Trump.

21:39.031 --> 21:44.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, apart from that, there is
no evidence
that -- you know, we -- when I
look up at

21:44.403 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the screen on most stations,
Judy -- and I'm
like the most open press person
here, I would

21:48.541 --> 21:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think -- I look up at the screen
and I see
no difference between the way
candidate Trump,

21:54.046 --> 21:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect Trump, and
President Trump
is being treated by many
outlets.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:59.485 --> 22:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, should the
media shut up
and listen for a while, as Steve
Bannon said?

22:01.921 --> 22:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: I think that
we should all
-- I think we should all learn
to listen more

22:05.224 --> 22:06.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to America.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's probably Steve
Bannon's central
pint, is that Donald Trump
proved that he

22:09.962 --> 22:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understood America in the way
that those who
say they're informing America
simply did not.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it really takes listening.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was a professional pollster
for 28 years.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My job was to listen to people
and take advice
from them.

22:20.706 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the best advice and
insights I have
ever received in my professional
life have

22:24.843 --> 22:29.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from -- most of them have
come from people,
by listening to them, by getting
out of the

22:29.114 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bubble, by getting out of our
coastal media
centers.

22:34.553 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is just said with, you
know, a great
deal of -- I have tried on many
different

22:38.524 --> 22:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
networks now -- it doesn't get
covered.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People cherry-pick one or two
words, but I
have tried many times now on
different networks

22:43.662 --> 22:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say, I would like us to have
an open relationship
and a fair and free press.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: But with a
free press comes
a responsibility.

22:50.903 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that responsibility comes in
allowing
to us ask the questions, like
what are we

22:55.407 --> 22:57.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
missing about America?

22:57.276 --> 23:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I like to say, we, the Trump
administration,
and the media, are -- have to
co-parent this

23:02.414 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, have joint custody of
the country
for the next eight years
probably.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's find a way to mutually
coexist.

23:08.087 --> 23:12.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But calling the president names,
going on
Twitter and saying snarky things
about him,

23:12.458 --> 23:16.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president of the United
States, that would
never pass editorial muster on a
network or

23:16.996 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the papers really should be
rethought.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're --
it's a big,
big conversation.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's early in the
administration.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know we're going to have
opportunities
to come back to that.

23:25.938 --> 23:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: I'm happy to
have it with
you, Judy.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

23:33.012 --> 23:38.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
thanks.

23:38.717 --> 23:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Let's take a
closer look now
at the rift developing between
President Trump

23:44.590 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto.

23:47.059 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For what that might mean for
both countries,
I'm joined by Roger Noriega of
the American

23:51.263 --> 23:53.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enterprise Institute.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a former assistant
secretary of state
for Western Hemisphere affairs
in the George

23:56.602 --> 23:58.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. Bush administration.

23:58.570 --> 24:02.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And James Carafano, vice
president of the
Davis Institute for National
Security and

24:02.708 --> 24:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foreign Policy at the Heritage
Foundation.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Very good to have you both here.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Roger, I want to start with you.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was the cancellation of this
meeting, because
both leaders were backed into a
corner, Donald

24:13.018 --> 24:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump by his promises in the
campaign that
he was going to build that wall
and Mexico

24:17.122 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going to pay for it, and
Pena Nieto because
his approval ratings are so
terrible, that

24:21.527 --> 24:23.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he has to play hardball
politically?

24:23.395 --> 24:26.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGER NORIEGA, American
Enterprise Institute:
Well, I think it's fair to say
that this was

24:26.832 --> 24:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very uncomfortable exchange
between these
two leaders.

24:31.236 --> 24:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, I think President
Trump didn't
want to be seen as having a
meeting canceled

24:38.477 --> 24:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on him, so he suggested that it
was a common
decision to maybe reschedule.

24:43.482 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, from the point of view of
Pena Nieto,
he -- you know, the insistence
that Mexico's

24:49.254 --> 24:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to pay for a wall, in
spite of his declarations
to the contrary, put this very
weak president

24:56.428 --> 24:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the defensive at home.

24:57.963 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, this is our
second largest
trading partner.

25:02.301 --> 25:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a country we should be
cultivating
a positive dialogue about how we
work together

25:08.407 --> 25:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make ourselves more secure
and more competitive
vis-a-vis the rest of the world.

25:11.877 --> 25:18.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And, James, did
Pena Nieto have
really any choice, after
President Trump tweeted

25:18.183 --> 25:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the meeting had to be
canceled if Mexico
wasn't going to pay for the
wall?

25:21.320 --> 25:24.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CARAFANO, Heritage
Foundation: Yes,
I don't think it's just about
that tweet.

25:24.089 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to start by saying, I
think the
Mexican government actually
started out exactly

25:27.926 --> 25:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, and not just what the
president has
said, but the whole the way the
campaign rhetoric

25:33.098 --> 25:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was portrayed.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what's being dumped into
Latin America.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not watching FOX News.

25:38.637 --> 25:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, I mean, they're basically
hearing a very
vitriolic, very aggressive
description of

25:43.842 --> 25:44.977 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But is there
really any side
in Mexico?

25:46.445 --> 25:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: Well, that's the
only side
that you hear in Mexico.

25:49.314 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yet, the administration
started out wanting
to be open, be constructive, and
engaging

25:55.454 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the U.S. I think they did a
great job.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They sent every positive signal
that they
wanted to work with you, and...

26:01.193 --> 26:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But then now this.

26:02.995 --> 26:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: And the U.S. --
I think this
administration responded in
kind.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were appreciative.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were really looking forward
to this.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But the Mexican
foreign minister
came, and on the day the Mexican
foreign minister

26:13.605 --> 26:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came into the U.S., that tweet
went out.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You were involved in the
transition.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CARAFANO: Right.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Was there a
discussion of what
would happen if they got to this
impasse?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: Well, I didn't
-- I just don't
think we're at an impasse.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we're at a bump in the
road.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And here's why I think a bump in
the road.

26:28.754 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, the
Mexican government
made the right call.

26:33.158 --> 26:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to work with the
United States,
and they do believe they can
work with this

26:36.328 --> 26:37.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as long as they're in
power...

26:38.530 --> 26:39.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTONIO MORA: So...

26:39.531 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: Well, let me
finish.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they're committed to
that.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And here's the deal.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if they -- if the
administration actually
follows through on the plan --
and I'm not

26:46.872 --> 26:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about tweeting and
what's reported
in the media or anything else --
but the things

26:50.242 --> 26:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Tillerson and Mattis and
Kelly talk about,
the things they want to do in
terms of securing

26:55.747 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the border, which actually
benefits both sides,
and in terms of modernizing the
trade relationships,

27:01.086 --> 27:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which again benefits both sides,
at the end
of the day, it's going to be
good for the

27:03.889 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States and good for
Mexico.

27:06.058 --> 27:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's good that, despite the
negative opinion
in Mexico that makes it very,
very difficult

27:10.896 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this administration to move
on, that they
keep moving on with their
relationship.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's...

27:15.200 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:17.035 --> 27:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Roger, do you
agree that it's
just a bump in the road, or is
this something

27:18.270 --> 27:20.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more serious?

27:20.072 --> 27:24.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGER NORIEGA: Well,
unfortunately, I think
Pena Nieto was in a very weak
position in

27:24.142 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his political party.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the economy is dead in the
water.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oil prices have caused deficits
to go up.

27:30.516 --> 27:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wrong kinds of economic
policies and tax
policies at home there in Mexico
are sort

27:34.853 --> 27:36.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of stifling its own
productivity.

27:36.989 --> 27:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those are the sorts of
things that we
should be working with, with our
partners

27:41.093 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Mexico to overcome, and, for
that matter,
Canada, too, as part of this
great NAFTA opportunity

27:46.865 --> 27:49.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that serves all of our
interests.

27:49.568 --> 27:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, this kind of
confrontational
approach and this insistence
that Mexico's

27:55.474 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to pay for the wall
actually weakens
the position of that responsible
center in

28:01.246 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico that wants to cooperate
more with us.

28:04.349 --> 28:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have people waiting in
the wings,
far left wings, by the way, who
are anti-American,

28:09.421 --> 28:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are populists, who do not
believe in NAFTA
either...

28:12.157 --> 28:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: You're talking
about Lopez Obrador.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Lopez Obrador in
particular.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, quite frankly...

28:17.663 --> 28:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: So, you're worried
that Lopez
Obrador could win an election
and be the Mexican

28:21.800 --> 28:22.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hugo Chavez?

28:22.801 --> 28:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: His polls are
going up.

28:24.570 --> 28:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we think Venezuela is a
mess where
it is, let's see a failed state
on the U.S.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

28:31.410 --> 28:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And what about
this back-and-forth
today on the tariffs, on Mexican
imports,

28:35.080 --> 28:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which they seem to have backed
off a little
bit?

28:37.516 --> 28:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the danger there, if that
happened, if
NAFTA goes away and they can
impose those

28:44.022 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tariffs, do you think there's
any chance that
we could see a trade war between
Mexico and

28:48.026 --> 28:49.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States?

28:49.928 --> 28:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: Well, I think
it's very unlikely
that we're going to see a trade
war between

28:51.663 --> 28:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States and Mexico
because it's
in nobody's interest to see a
trade war.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe this is a negotiating
tactic.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the guy that wrote "The
Art of the
Deal."

28:58.203 --> 29:00.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe they said that.

29:00.038 --> 29:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe the next thing they do
is turn around
and the Mexican president says,
well, that's

29:02.374 --> 29:03.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unacceptable.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we say, OK, we make a
concession to you,
we're not going to do that.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, all of a sudden, the
Mexican president
looks stronger.

29:07.346 --> 29:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, where my optimism comes from
is the only
path forward for Mexico is
better security

29:13.485 --> 29:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the border, a productive
trade relationship
with the United States, and a
cooperative

29:18.690 --> 29:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.-Mexican regional approach
to dealing
with the regional issues which
are hurting

29:23.161 --> 29:24.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them and hurting us.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's the only practical
course forward.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And that's not
just important
for Mexico.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's important for the United
States.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a huge trade partner of
ours.

29:31.737 --> 29:36.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We rely on them on
counterterrorism efforts,
counternarcotic efforts.

29:36.208 --> 29:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And millions of jobs are either
in whole or
partially dependent on trade
with Mexico in

29:40.512 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

29:42.347 --> 29:45.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Absolutely, 14
million jobs
on NAFTA in general, six million
just on trade

29:45.117 --> 29:47.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Mexico.

29:47.352 --> 29:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure Jim would agree
with me completely
that we want more cooperation
from Mexico

29:52.290 --> 29:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on illegal immigration, to
secure that border,
to fight drugs, and, for that
matter, create

29:59.097 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of economic dynamism
among our three
countries that will create jobs
for all of

30:04.736 --> 30:07.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our folks here in North America.

30:07.272 --> 30:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're not going to get more
of that with
this kind of confrontational
approach.

30:11.376 --> 30:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: I only have 30
seconds left,
so I want you guys to get a
quick final word.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you think this is going
to play out?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:18.417 --> 30:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CARAFANO: And I think
there's a joint
responsibility here with the
U.S. government

30:20.452 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Mexican government to
address that
issue of the American people,
and both of

30:24.556 --> 30:29.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our governments together
convince them that
this plan, despite that is said
in the press

30:29.961 --> 30:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and everything else, that this
plan, if it
is followed through both on
security and trade,

30:31.997 --> 30:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the end of the day, is going
to be good
for Mexico.

30:34.766 --> 30:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's, I think, a joint
responsibility
with the Trump and the Mexican
present administration.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they have got the work cut
out for them,
no question.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But with all this
confrontation?

30:42.007 --> 30:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: We need more
cooperation, more
understanding, more
communication in a mutual,

30:46.445 --> 30:47.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respectful way.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, my president is the
American president.

30:49.881 --> 30:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want him to succeed in
making that border
more secure and generating jobs
for us.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have to do it in a
cooperative way
with our natural partners.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: An issue for an
awful lot of
people.

30:59.958 --> 31:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roger Noriega, James Carafano,
very good to
you have both here.

31:03.662 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Thank you.

31:09.267 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CARAFANO: Thanks.

31:13.472 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
director's
take on weaving together grief,
love and laughter

31:22.447 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Oscar-nominated film
"Manchester By
the Sea"; and eight men who have
spent their

31:27.886 --> 31:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entire adult life behind bars.

31:30.889 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: aging and living on
the edge of
a financial cliff.

31:35.927 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week economics,
correspondent Paul Solman
brought you the story of
Elizabeth White,

31:40.465 --> 31:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was once comfortably middle
class but
is now nearing traditional
retirement age

31:45.137 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and struggling to make ends
meet.

31:47.506 --> 31:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Paul looks at just how
common her
story has become.

31:51.543 --> 31:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

31:55.180 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE, Author,
"Fifty-Five, Unemployed
and Faking Normal": I would say
I feel optimistic,

31:59.751 --> 32:01.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
generally.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.723 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN:
Sixty-three-year-old Elizabeth
White has been severely
underemployed for

32:04.756 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three years.

32:06.424 --> 32:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I had $750 left
to kind of
make it through the end of the
month.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have done it on less.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Deborah Burkholder
hasn't had
a full-time job since 2009.

32:17.435 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH BURKHOLDER, Job Seeker:
I don't have
enough to cover January bills if
nothing changes.

32:21.973 --> 32:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to predict what will
happen the
next month, you know, and
calculating how

32:28.146 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many times do I have to go
through this until
I'm buried?

32:31.483 --> 32:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: There is a
low-level stress
that you -- you know, that is
wearing.

32:39.024 --> 32:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: One way to manage,
airing out
anxiety in what White calls a
resilience circle

32:44.162 --> 32:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of financially fragile friends,
all formerly
middle class, all well past 50,
and all too

32:51.670 --> 32:54.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
common these days, says
economist Teresa Ghilarducci.

32:54.306 --> 32:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI, The New
School for Social
Research: We're finding that
very well-educated

32:58.610 --> 33:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, people who have done
everything right,
are behind, really behind.

33:05.550 --> 33:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are hoping they can
stay in the labor
market, but a word that's used
in other countries

33:11.356 --> 33:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that isn't used here is very apt
here.

33:14.192 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The word is superannuated, That
You have kept
yourself going, but the labor
market employers

33:21.399 --> 33:27.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't put the same value on your
experience
and your know-how and your
wisdom as you might've

33:27.105 --> 33:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hoped, or they have done in the
past.

33:28.673 --> 33:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the experience
can be a killer.

33:32.711 --> 33:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Yale study found that just one
layoff in
a lifetime increases the odds of
a stroke

33:38.283 --> 33:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or heart attack by 40 percent.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what if you're just worried
about maintaining
your standard of living?

33:44.589 --> 33:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI: My research
shows that
uncertainty about your income at
older ages

33:52.530 --> 34:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
causes more depression, causes
more anxiety,
which could lead to more chronic
heart failure,

34:00.472 --> 34:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heart disease, does actually
mean shorter
lifespans.

34:04.109 --> 34:09.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thus, the
resilience circle,
as a way of reasserting some
measure of control.

34:09.247 --> 34:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: There's a lot
around us to
make us feel bad.

34:13.118 --> 34:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot around us that
would say, oh,
this is all your fault, you
landed here, you're

34:19.357 --> 34:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a loser, you landed here.

34:20.959 --> 34:24.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So people can start
self-medicating.

34:24.362 --> 34:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can start -- I mean, just a
lot of sort
of negative places that it can
take them.

34:28.600 --> 34:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If we take everything as
personal, that
that very thinking is going to
prevent us

34:35.273 --> 34:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from taking effective action and
from being
creative.

34:37.943 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Coming and having these
conversations
always anchors me in a different
way, so that

34:44.149 --> 34:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can tell myself a better
story.

34:45.817 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though, of course,
emotional
support doesn't pay the bills.

34:49.387 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I think a lot
of people who've
gotten pushed out of the work
force and are

34:54.426 --> 35:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in late 50s, early 60s are never
going to
have a traditional 9:00-5:00 W-2
job.

35:03.034 --> 35:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to be able to
have the lives
that we thought that we were
going to have,

35:09.975 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and there's some mourning of
that.

35:11.943 --> 35:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: White hopes her new
self-published
book, "Fifty-Five, Unemployed
and Faking Normal,"

35:17.115 --> 35:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will prompt people to stop
faking and open
up.

35:20.785 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She herself was inspired to go
public after
reading the "Atlantic" magazine
article "The

35:25.790 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secret Shame of the Middle
Class" about writer
Neal Gabler's financial
failures.

35:30.895 --> 35:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL GABLER, Author/Journalist:
There are
so many people in trouble.

35:33.765 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Judy Woodruff
interviewed Gabler
when he came out about his
finances last summer.

35:38.336 --> 35:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: And it struck me
that talking
about our financial situation is
very much

35:42.907 --> 35:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like men not wanting to talk
about sexual
impotence.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just not something you do.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an embarrassment.

35:49.514 --> 35:50.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a shame.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a humiliation.

35:52.283 --> 35:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And financial problems are
exactly the same
thing.

35:56.554 --> 35:57.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're humiliated.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're ashamed.

35:59.624 --> 36:03.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're embarrassed about telling
anyone that
you are suffering financial
difficulties.

36:03.495 --> 36:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now Gabler, like
Elizabeth White,
readily admits he could have
saved more, been

36:08.333 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more frugal, but so could a lot
of us.

36:11.870 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2015, fully 46 percent of
adults said they'd
have to borrow or pawn to come
up with $400

36:20.412 --> 36:21.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in an emergency.

36:21.846 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ed Wolff (ph) has studied the
growing rainy
day fund gap for years.

36:26.451 --> 36:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Today, the average family
has enough
financial reserves to keep going
for about

36:34.926 --> 36:36.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three weeks.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And reserves for
older age?

36:38.963 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI: Over half of
people who
are working now and over 50 have
nothing for

36:45.937 --> 36:47.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
retirement savings.

36:47.138 --> 36:50.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will only have Social
Security to rely
on.

36:50.575 --> 36:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our conception that the way
we can mitigate
the fact that people don't have
retirement

36:56.748 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
savings can be more work, or
working longer,
or just sort of staying in the
game for longer

37:03.721 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is really a false hope.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a false promise.

37:08.693 --> 37:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though seven in 10
Americans
say they plan to work as long as
possible,

37:13.231 --> 37:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who's going to hire them?

37:15.200 --> 37:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth White doubts she will
ever have
the resources she once did, so
she's smalling

37:20.205 --> 37:21.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

37:21.940 --> 37:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: So, smalling up
is really,
what do I value, and getting
really clear

37:26.511 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what that personally means
for you, and
then trying to figure out, how
can I have

37:31.549 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pieces and elements of that?

37:33.384 --> 37:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like displaying
African-inspired
art left over from her failed
retail venture.

37:38.723 --> 37:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom McDonough's (ph) focus,
keeping fit and
healthy.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's cheap to do, he says, but:

37:44.863 --> 37:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: That doesn't make medical
insurance any
cheaper.

37:48.366 --> 37:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If anything, the financial
burden, it continues
to grow and there's nothing that
I can do

37:55.607 --> 37:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to prevent that from happening.

37:58.676 --> 38:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Indeed, the longer
he hangs in
there, the further his resources
have to stretch.

38:05.416 --> 38:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florie Liser is OK for now, but
her sister
and niece had to move in with
her two years

38:10.355 --> 38:12.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

38:12.190 --> 38:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FLORIE LISER, Job Seeker: My
sister hasn't
worked in a number of years and
lost her home.

38:16.261 --> 38:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's an aerospace engineer, for
goodness
sake.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's the brilliant one in the
family.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, for me to see her in
that place is
very tough.

38:25.603 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What if things don't change for
her or for
my niece?

38:32.944 --> 38:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, does that mean that I'm
going to be
sort of responsible for putting
a roof over

38:42.287 --> 38:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their heads and all of this kind
of things?

38:44.355 --> 38:45.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Forever.

38:45.356 --> 38:46.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: For forever.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FLORIE LISER: I mean, I just
don't know.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to think about
that.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Elizabeth White's
bottom line?

38:52.397 --> 38:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Share your plight, pare back to
the basics,
and try to help those of us
still comfortable

38:57.602 --> 39:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand that there but for
the grace
of God.

39:01.005 --> 39:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: We live in a
culture where
it's just delicious to shame and
blame.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have what I call sometimes a
smugtocracy.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The smugtocracy.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Smugtocracy.

39:13.551 --> 39:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can decide that, you know,
you have done
very well, and you don't want
anything to

39:18.523 --> 39:19.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do with these people.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I'm telling you, some of
them are in
your family.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know them.

39:23.661 --> 39:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm saying is, the numbers
are so big
here, that it's going to affect
everybody.

39:28.199 --> 39:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from
Washington, D.C.

39:38.042 --> 39:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: It's award season
in Hollywood,
and one of the most highly
praised films of

39:47.285 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the year, "Manchester by the
Sea," was nominated
for six Academy Awards this
week.

39:51.890 --> 39:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its director, Kenneth Lonergan
was nominated
for two of them.

39:55.827 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with him
recently at the
Atlantic Theater in New York.

39:59.330 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This report is part of our
ongoing coverage
of awards for the 2016 movie
season, Beyond

40:04.669 --> 40:07.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Red Carpet.

40:07.505 --> 40:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In an early scene
in the film,
"Manchester by the Sea," Lee
Chandler learns

40:15.880 --> 40:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that his recently deceased
brother has named
him as his nephew's guardian,
and the weight

40:20.985 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the world comes crashing down
again.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK, Actor: He can't
live with me.

40:25.323 --> 40:26.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I live in one room.

40:26.991 --> 40:30.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Well, but Joe has
provided for Patrick's
upkeep, food, clothes, et
cetera.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the house the boat are owned
outright.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: I can't commute
from Boston
every day until he turns 18.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I think the idea was that
you would
relocate.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: Relocate to
where?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Here?

40:42.073 --> 40:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As played by
Casey Affleck,
Lee is a lost, mostly silent man
at sea over

40:46.311 --> 40:47.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some hidden grief.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, says director Kenneth
Lonergan, it's
more than that.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN, Director,
"Manchester by
the Sea": I don't see it as a
film about grief.

40:53.518 --> 40:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see it as a film about love,
and about people
trying to help each other and
take care of

40:58.856 --> 41:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each other, as much as it's a
film about grief.

41:00.825 --> 41:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is about grief, obviously,
but it's really
about someone who's trying to do
right by

41:06.164 --> 41:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family, even though he's
ready to quit.

41:08.566 --> 41:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film's title
is also its
setting, a small coastal
Massachusetts fishing

41:14.405 --> 41:21.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
village, a place Lee Chandler is
pulled back
to against his will.

41:21.646 --> 41:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kenneth Lonergan wrote the
screenplay as well,
and says he worried at first how
he'd capture

41:26.517 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the kind of trauma he himself
had never experienced.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Nobody can appreciate
what you have
been through.

41:30.822 --> 41:36.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you really feel you can't
take this
on, you know, that's your right.

41:36.627 --> 41:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: You always
write about things
that are not exactly you, and
sometimes things

41:41.065 --> 41:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are really far afield.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's the emotional
content that tells
-- that's the acid test.

41:46.571 --> 41:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you couldn't enjoy a
movie if you
weren't able to put yourself
into other people's

41:50.341 --> 41:53.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shoes, and you certainly
couldn't write or
direct a movie if you weren't
able to do that.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how do you do
that?

41:55.480 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: When it's
going well, you
don't have to think these things
through.

41:57.548 --> 41:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just -- I pretend I'm him.

41:59.384 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I pretend I'm the other people
in the room
with him.

42:01.419 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I -- then they start
talking, and I write
it down.

42:04.722 --> 42:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when it's not going well, I
try to get
back to that place.

42:09.127 --> 42:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But are you
writing the pauses,
the shuffles, the -- you know,
the moments

42:15.199 --> 42:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's so fraught, right?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: Yes, most of
them, but not
all of them.

42:19.370 --> 42:24.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, the actors will come in,
and you discover
just as much in the set as you
do at your

42:24.242 --> 42:25.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
desk.

42:25.977 --> 42:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lonergan first
made his name
as a playwright, with such works
as "This

42:29.180 --> 42:31.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is Our Youth" and "Lobby Hero."

42:31.516 --> 42:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: I don't know what the
church's official
position is on adultery these
days.

42:36.087 --> 42:38.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Manchester" is
his third film.

42:38.523 --> 42:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His first, "You Can Count on
Me," set in Upstate
New York and dealing with a
different kind

42:43.161 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of family drama, came out in
2000.

42:46.764 --> 42:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second, "Margaret," set in
New York after
9/11, was a traumatic experience
for Lonergan

42:52.437 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself, after numerous disputes
with the
studio led to a very limited
release.

42:57.675 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: With
"Manchester," Lonergan
again deals with loss and the
whole idea of

43:04.248 --> 43:06.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
closure.

43:06.117 --> 43:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: Which is a
really unpleasant
word to me, and I don't know
what it means.

43:09.387 --> 43:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not that -- there are
many really
beautiful and inspiring stories
about people

43:14.792 --> 43:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overcoming incredible odds, much
worse than
the odds my characters face, and
coming out

43:19.330 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other end whole or stronger
or -- that's
the good side of it.

43:23.601 --> 43:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bad side of it to me is the
obligation
to do so, like the failure to
recognize that

43:27.972 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are millions, billions of
people who
have suffered blows that they're
not going

43:32.310 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to recover from.

43:33.544 --> 43:36.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: If that sounds
depressing,
well, it is.

43:36.948 --> 43:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the film has gained much
positive attention
because of its powerful
performances and the

43:41.919 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way it packs its emotional
punch, with parts
of the story told in flashbacks
to see the

43:47.391 --> 43:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters in different, happier
times.

43:50.094 --> 43:53.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: This is the same
girl who was
over at the house?

43:53.231 --> 43:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: No, that was Silvie and
this is Sandy.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they don't know about each
other, so...

43:57.702 --> 44:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's also a
great deal of
humor and warmth, especially
between Lee and

44:02.273 --> 44:03.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his teenaged nephew.

44:03.541 --> 44:07.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: Do you actually
have sex with
these girls?

44:07.311 --> 44:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: We don't just play
computer games.

44:08.679 --> 44:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: With both of
them?

44:10.748 --> 44:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Well, with Sandy's mom
here, it's sort
of strictly just, like, basement
business.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: What is it that
mean?

44:19.557 --> 44:21.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: It means I'm working on
it.

44:21.826 --> 44:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: People are
funny.

44:23.027 --> 44:25.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, they just are.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that doesn't go
away.

44:27.365 --> 44:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The world doesn't grieve when
you're grieving.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The world goes on about its
business.

44:30.968 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're having a good day and I'm
having a
bad one and vice versa.

44:34.272 --> 44:36.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they could be very good and
very bad at
the same time.

44:36.774 --> 44:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's -- you multiply that
by seven billion
and you have one element of
human experience.

44:43.014 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's an
interesting way of
looking at life, the world.

44:46.651 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: It's true.

44:47.652 --> 44:48.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's true.

44:48.653 --> 44:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't think for seven
billion people.

44:50.555 --> 44:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can't put yourself in
positions of
the seven billion people.

44:52.890 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you can certainly stretch a
little bit
and put yourself in a few
hundred other people's

44:57.028 --> 44:58.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place, I would hope.

44:58.863 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So then what's
the job of a
writer in that, when you think
about the world

45:02.567 --> 45:04.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that way?

45:04.268 --> 45:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: One job that
you have is
to notice patterns that only you
notice.

45:06.671 --> 45:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A writer, a director or an actor
or any artist
or creative person is who is
re-representing

45:12.343 --> 45:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life through their work is, I
think, describing
the patterns that they see.

45:17.548 --> 45:28.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In "Manchester By
the Sea,"
Lonergan knows he's fortunate to
be working

45:28.793 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with great actors, include
Michelle Williams,
giving life to his words.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE WILLIAMS, Actress: I
really kept
in touch with Joe.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been kind of weird for me
not seeing
Patrick.

45:36.601 --> 45:37.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: I knew that.

45:37.868 --> 45:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE WILLIAMS: Oh, OK, I
didn't know.

45:39.637 --> 45:41.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: You could see him
if you want.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE WILLIAMS: Could we ever
have lunch?

45:44.041 --> 45:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: You have a
version in your
head that works.

45:46.978 --> 45:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the actors come, and
that's what
I would say would be...

45:50.214 --> 45:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And they mess it
up or they
do it...

45:51.949 --> 45:53.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:53.818 --> 45:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LONERGAN: Well, if
they're not seeing
all the elements in the scene
that I can see,

45:55.653 --> 45:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then I will try to point them
out.

45:57.989 --> 46:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once they understand the scene
at least as
well as I did, they then go much
further.

46:02.026 --> 46:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they become the characters,
whereas I
only imagine the characters.

46:05.763 --> 46:10.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when it's Casey and
Michelle, I really
expect and get, like, way more
than I -- than

46:10.868 --> 46:12.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that I put in.

46:12.637 --> 46:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you have people like
this, you're
-- sometimes, you just sit back
and watch

46:15.806 --> 46:17.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them go.

46:17.541 --> 46:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's just -- that is why
you become
a director, or why you become a
playwright

46:20.778 --> 46:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a screenwriter, is to see
actors do that
with your -- with what you
imagined initially

46:26.517 --> 46:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in your little room some time
two or three
years ago.

46:29.687 --> 46:31.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's just beautiful.

46:31.622 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kenneth Lonergan,
his film,
and three lead actors all
received Oscar nominations

46:35.660 --> 46:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week, aiming toward the
February 26 awards
ceremony.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series.

46:52.843 --> 46:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series.

46:58.215 --> 47:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from inmates at
California's
San Quentin Prison who committed
crimes when

47:03.487 --> 47:06.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were young and are serving
up to life
terms.

47:06.657 --> 47:11.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're part of a weekly
discussion group
where they focus on
self-improvement through

47:11.429 --> 47:13.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discussion, education, and
counseling.

47:13.531 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The program is part of a larger
collaboration
with the design firm IDEO and
the California

47:19.203 --> 47:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department of Corrections to
develop prisons
that support the
transformational growth of

47:23.974 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incarcerated young men.

47:25.776 --> 47:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I have been incarcerated
for first-degree
murder and robbery at the age of
17, and I

47:31.949 --> 47:33.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been incarcerated for
almost 28 years.

47:33.818 --> 47:36.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I have been incarcerated
for the past
31 years.

47:36.387 --> 47:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I came here when I was 19 years
old.

47:38.422 --> 47:42.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: At the age of 19, I
committed a robbery-murder
with two of my friends at the
time.

47:42.727 --> 47:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am sentenced to 25 years
to life for
that.

47:44.729 --> 47:50.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I committed two
second-degree murders
at the age of 19, and I was
sentenced to 30

47:50.267 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to life, plus 11.

47:52.069 --> 47:56.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: At the age of 18, I
committed first-degree
murder in commission of a
robbery, and was

47:56.741 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sentenced to 25 years to life.

47:57.908 --> 48:00.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: I committed a
robbery-murder at the age
of 18.

48:00.411 --> 48:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was sentenced to 25 years to
life.

48:02.279 --> 48:04.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: At the age of 16, I
committed my crime.

48:04.648 --> 48:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I handed my co-defendant a
loaded .38 special
pistol to commit a robbery, and
during the

48:11.288 --> 48:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
process of that robbery, a man
was shot and
killed.

48:14.658 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When I was 15, I committed
a crime of
first-degree murder, and I was
sentenced to

48:19.396 --> 48:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25 years to life in prison

48:21.031 --> 48:24.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: What did it feel like
to receive
a life sentence at such a young
age?

48:24.735 --> 48:30.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When somebody asked me,
hey, you know
how long do you got, and I would
say, I'm

48:30.341 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
serving 25 years to life.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they told me was that, just
get comfortable.

48:34.979 --> 48:40.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are never going home.

48:40.251 --> 48:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: My father was an alcoholic
that used
to abuse my mother.

48:50.294 --> 48:55.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: My father was an alcoholic
that used
to abuse my mother.

48:55.366 --> 48:58.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Later, she married my
stepfather, who was
also physically abusive.

48:58.836 --> 49:03.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When I met my friend's
older brother
that was committing robberies, I
felt powerful

49:03.374 --> 49:07.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
doing that, when I felt
powerless at home
to stop my father abusing me and
my mother.

49:07.978 --> 49:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm originally from Laos.

49:10.247 --> 49:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Actually, I was born in a
refugee camp.

49:14.418 --> 49:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I joined a gang at 12 years old.

49:16.153 --> 49:20.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I committed a gang-related
murder and
my mother and little brother was
killed in

49:20.124 --> 49:21.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retaliation.

49:21.625 --> 49:25.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: My grandfather was killed,
brutally murdered
when I was 10 years old.

49:25.262 --> 49:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At that point, my innocence was
lost and I
begin to shut down.

49:28.966 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Having a dad that was in
and out of prison,
that was selling drugs and just
introducing

49:33.971 --> 49:37.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me to a criminal lifestyle, that
was a big
part of it.

49:37.041 --> 49:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I feel like a bigger part of
it was finding
out that, when I was born, he
denied me.

49:43.881 --> 49:47.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that was one of the
main things
that led to my committing my
crime.

49:47.585 --> 49:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: A big part of my story is
coming to San
Quentin.

49:49.620 --> 49:52.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Quentin is a different
environment than
most prisons.

49:52.690 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being around men who were
telling their stories
allowed me to know that it was
OK to be vulnerable.

49:58.762 --> 50:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hadn't talked about my crime
for almost
15 years.

50:01.398 --> 50:06.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: After being incarcerated
for 27 years,
I was open and honest about the
murder that

50:06.804 --> 50:08.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I committed.

50:08.539 --> 50:11.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the looks of empathy, as
opposed to
looks of judgment, that created
the shift

50:11.609 --> 50:13.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in my mind-set.

50:13.444 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When I first started, I
wasn't able to
talk about myself, because I was
too embarrassed

50:17.281 --> 50:20.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and too ashamed to express the
things that
I have done.

50:20.150 --> 50:25.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It was hard in a
higher-level prison
to shed some of that
masculinity, the ideas

50:25.856 --> 50:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of masculinity and what I should
be and how
a criminal should act.

50:30.861 --> 50:33.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you come to a place
like San Quentin,
and it's a culture shock.

50:33.998 --> 50:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I was wondering like,
what's in the water,
right, because the guys were so
super articulate

50:39.270 --> 50:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and well-spoken and showing much
insight into
themselves.

50:42.873 --> 50:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I started off with a
program called GRIP,
which stands for Granting Rage
in the Power.

50:47.912 --> 50:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It helped me develop emotional
intelligence
and cultivate the mindfulness.

50:51.315 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: What really keeps me
motivated is this
program called SQUIRES, where I
am able to

50:56.487 --> 50:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mentor the at-risk and neglected
youth.

50:58.555 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
When I see this
14--to-15-year-old telling
me his story and I see myself in
that kid,

51:03.227 --> 51:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is easier for me to have that
conversation
with them.

51:05.963 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you ever think that
you could
relapse into crime?

51:08.799 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, based on the change
that I have
made now, there is no way that I
could find

51:13.437 --> 51:15.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
myself relapsing in a crime.

51:15.572 --> 51:21.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not blaming my past for the
traumatic
experience, for the crimes that
I committed.

51:21.245 --> 51:27.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do understand that it was
a contributing
factor to what I did, and I do
take total

51:27.217 --> 51:28.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
responsibility for it.

51:29.019 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Catching a case looks like
this.

51:30.754 --> 51:35.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm walking down the street, and
then, all
of a sudden, it just falls out
the sky in

51:35.159 --> 51:36.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
my hand.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I made a choice to carry a
pistol.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I made a choice to commit harm
to another
person.

51:39.730 --> 51:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the difference
between catching
a case and saying committed my
crime.

51:42.700 --> 51:47.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I was stuck at this point
where I only
committed a robbery, and I
didn't commit a

51:47.271 --> 51:48.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
murder.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of my co-defendants was the
actual one
who committed the murder.

51:50.374 --> 51:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A young man at the age of 19
lost his life
because of the actions that I
did.

51:55.679 --> 52:02.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you think about
that crime still?

52:02.186 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Yes, definitely, most
definitely.

52:08.425 --> 52:13.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I did when I was 15
years old, I
shattered a community.

52:13.297 --> 52:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tore a family apart.

52:16.066 --> 52:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was a taker, and I took a
life.

52:19.069 --> 52:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I do think about that
every time.

52:22.039 --> 52:24.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: What would you tell
your dad about
your life today?

52:24.475 --> 52:34.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I would say, you know what,
thanks, pops,
for all that B.S. that you
instilled in me.

52:34.585 --> 52:40.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I would tell him you know, I
get you.

52:40.858 --> 52:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, all that denying me, all
that irresponsibility,
I mean, you didn't know any
better.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say, you know what,
I forgive
you.

52:50.501 --> 52:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: What would you like to
tell somebody
at that same age about to commit
a violent...

52:56.373 --> 52:59.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: You have value.

52:59.643 --> 53:01.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have importance.

53:01.078 --> 53:02.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You matter in this world.

53:02.479 --> 53:06.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing that can come
between that
and yourself.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: My name is Adnan (ph).

53:30.774 --> 53:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
