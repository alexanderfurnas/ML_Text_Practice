JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.306 --> 00:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Trump's
pick for secretary of labor,
Andrew Puzder,

00:12.312 --> 00:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
withdraws from consideration, as
a number
of Senate Republicans join
Democrats in opposition.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.486 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:19.519 --> 00:21.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Papers are being leaked. Things
are being

00:21.455 --> 00:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaked. It's criminal action,
criminal act.

00:24.458 --> 00:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
slams intelligence
leaks amid new reports that his
aides were

00:30.163 --> 00:34.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in repeated contact with Russia
during the
campaign.

00:34.601 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: In another dramatic
shift, with
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
by his side,

00:40.274 --> 00:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump opens the door to
dropping U.S.
support for a two-state solution
in the Middle

00:46.280 --> 00:47.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
East.

00:48.015 --> 00:52.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, scientists fight back, the
nationwide
effort to protect environmental
data in an

00:52.786 --> 00:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uncertain political moment.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN O'BRIEN, Programmer: If
we have the
foresight to back the stuff up
now, we may

00:58.492 --> 01:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be -- maybe later generations
will thank us.

01:01.495 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.435 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.305 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
Cabinet in
the making is reeling tonight
from another

01:20.547 --> 01:22.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
body blow.

01:22.382 --> 01:27.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Puzder withdrew today as
the nominee
for labor secretary, two days
after National

01:27.654 --> 01:31.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security Adviser Michael Flynn
resigned under
fire.

01:31.725 --> 01:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins is at the
Capitol, where
she's been covering this story.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa, what happened?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, it was
Republicans.
They didn't have enough
Republican votes to

01:40.000 --> 01:44.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pass this confirmation -- to
have this confirmation
happen. And it was fast-moving
today, Judy.

01:44.838 --> 01:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just this morning, John Cornyn,
who is in
charge of the vote counting for
Republicans

01:48.508 --> 01:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, told reporters he will be
confirmed.
Just hours later, they didn't
have the votes.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

01:55.716 --> 01:59.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to one of the senators,
Jeff Flake,
who wasn't yet a yes vote, and
he said the

01:59.353 --> 02:04.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main problem was Puzder's
revelation that
he had hired an undocumented
worker and had

02:04.491 --> 02:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failed to pay back taxes until
he was nominated.
Flake told me, Judy, for a labor
secretary,

02:10.530 --> 02:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you just can't ignore that.

02:12.466 --> 02:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, with
Puzder now out
of the picture, we're hearing
from Republicans,

02:18.739 --> 02:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the White House that they
think Democrats
are slow-rolling all the rest of
the president's

02:23.710 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cabinet nominees. Where does all
that stand?

02:25.846 --> 02:29.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
This is the
slowest confirmation process in
history, but

02:29.649 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats point out that, in
fact, many of
Trump's nominees did not get
their paperwork

02:34.021 --> 02:36.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in as quickly as in the past.

02:36.423 --> 02:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at where we are right
now in the
general. So far, the Senate has
confirmed

02:40.127 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
12 of President Trump's Cabinet
nominees.
One has been withdrawn, as we
mentioned, Mr.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Puzder tonight. Judy, that
leaves eight more
Cabinet nominees waiting in line
to go through

02:50.537 --> 02:52.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

02:52.406 --> 03:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next one is (AUDIO GAP).
There was a hiccup
on Mick Mulvaney just today, as
Senator John

03:01.715 --> 03:06.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McCain of Arizona said he, a
Republican, will
oppose him. Looks like he will
have the votes,

03:06.620 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that's not something -- they
want all
the Republicans on board his
nomination. They

03:10.323 --> 03:12.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't have them.

03:12.125 --> 03:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, we know
that's not
the only set of issues that's
roiling Congress

03:16.063 --> 03:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. The aftermath of the
departure
of General Flynn at the White
House is certainly

03:22.903 --> 03:24.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still drawing reaction.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you hearing about that?

03:26.573 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another wild
day. Until just
three hours ago, the main issue
dominating

03:30.510 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the news up here on Capitol Hill
about the
Trump White House was Russia.

03:36.249 --> 03:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a tumultuous 24 hours,
President Trump
ignored reported contacts
between campaign

03:41.388 --> 03:46.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
advisers and Russian
intelligence. Instead,
at a news conference with
Israeli Prime Minister

03:46.126 --> 03:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Benjamin Netanyahu, he went
after the media
and those giving the media
information.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Papers are being leaked. Things
are being

03:53.567 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaked. It's criminal actions,
criminal act,
and it's been going on for a
long time -- before

03:59.840 --> 04:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. But now it's really going
on, and people
are trying to cover up for a
terrible loss

04:07.547 --> 04:11.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the Democrats had under
Hillary Clinton.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, Mr.
Trump also
defended ousted National
Security Adviser

04:15.555 --> 04:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Flynn. The initial
concern surrounded
Flynn's phone calls with
Russia's ambassador

04:20.794 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year, but after revelations
that he misled
the White House about those
calls, Flynn was

04:27.033 --> 04:28.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forced out this week.

04:28.835 --> 04:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think he's been
treated very,
very unfairly by the media -- as
I call it,

04:34.407 --> 04:40.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fake media, in many cases.
And I think
it's really a sad thing that he
was treated

04:40.280 --> 04:42.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so badly.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
got no direct
questions during the news
conference about

04:44.651 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new turn in the story, and
ignored shouted
questions afterward.

04:48.522 --> 04:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. President. can you
guarantee
that nobody on your campaign had
any contacts

04:53.426 --> 04:56.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the Russians? Mr.
President, any questions
on Russia?

04:56.296 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That followed a
report in
The New York Times that aides
working in the

05:00.367 --> 05:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign had -- quote --
"repeated contacts
with senior Russian intelligence
officials

05:06.473 --> 05:08.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the year before the
election."

05:08.875 --> 05:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reporter Matt Apuzzo worked on
that story.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
It's really
the volume of those calls that
really caught

05:14.447 --> 05:20.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence by surprise,
because they
didn't see anything like that in
other countries.

05:20.587 --> 05:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, it's the timing
that's the
issue. Is there collusion
between the Trump

05:24.624 --> 05:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign and the Russia hacking
efforts?

05:27.194 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't have evidence to back
up, you know,
any charges of collusion.

05:31.498 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While the White
House said
relatively little, Capitol Hill
was abuzz.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic senators canceled
their schedules
to hold a quickly convened
meeting. Their

05:40.974 --> 05:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders emerged calling for an
independent
counsel at the Justice
Department.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader:
And the reports of constant
contact between

05:47.714 --> 05:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the top officials in the Trump
campaign and
Russian intelligence are
chilling. I have

05:54.554 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in Congress for a long
time. I have never
seen anything like this.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democratic
Leader Chuck Schumer
is pushing for three things:
preservation

06:02.529 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all White House e-mails and
records dealing
with Russia, public testimony by
Trump officials

06:07.834 --> 06:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Paul Manafort and Michael
Flynn, and
for Attorney General Jeff
Sessions, a top

06:12.706 --> 06:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump supporter in the campaign,
to recuse
himself from any Russia-related
probe.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi:

06:20.046 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
It just points to the need for
us to have

06:22.349 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an outside independent
commission, nonpartisan
commission outside, with
subpoena power to

06:30.123 --> 06:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find the truth and what this
means to our
national security. The president
is flirting

06:36.062 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with danger.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Republican lawmakers
are watching closely. Senator
Lindsey Graham

06:41.568 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told FOX News today that, if
there were inappropriate
contacts, Congress should launch
a bipartisan

06:47.874 --> 06:49.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

06:49.609 --> 06:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, Republican leaders are
signaling
they don't want any new
investigations. On

06:54.014 --> 06:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MSNBC, House Speaker Paul Ryan
endorsed the
Intelligence Committee
investigations already

06:59.786 --> 07:01.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under way.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
Russia has been trying to meddle
with our

07:03.456 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country in our last elections.
That's established.
We know that. No one has -- no
one has made

07:07.961 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence, no one has made the
claim that evidence
exists that Donald Trump or his
people were

07:13.667 --> 07:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in on it, were involved in that.

07:15.669 --> 07:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The issue is
made more difficult
for Republicans by the large
number of unknowns

07:20.640 --> 07:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and unanswered questions about
relationships
between Russia and the Trump
world.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, Matt Apuzzo of The New
York Times:

07:27.614 --> 07:36.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Was anybody in
Trump world aware
of or colluding with Russian
efforts to hack

07:36.556 --> 07:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary's advisers or the DNC
and influence
the election? What were these
people talking

07:42.395 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to senior Russian intelligence
authorities
about? Were they knowingly
talking to people

07:47.000 --> 07:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the intelligence world?

07:48.968 --> 07:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them, Paul Manafort, told
us he never
knowingly spoke to anybody in
Russian intelligence,

07:54.174 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said, you know, it's not
like these guys
are wearing badges.

07:56.609 --> 08:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for the
Kremlin, Russian
spokesman Dmitry Peskov told
reporters today,

08:01.614 --> 08:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Let's not believe anonymous
information."

08:04.084 --> 08:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there does seem to be some
potential
bipartisan agreement. Senators,
Democratic

08:09.022 --> 08:13.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Republican, that we talked
to today seem
to agree that they want to have
Michael Flynn

08:13.593 --> 08:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come to the Capitol to testify
in public.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When could that happen? I asked
Intelligence
Chairman Richard Burr, and he
said he hasn't

08:21.167 --> 08:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been invited yet because --
quote -- "We don't
even know what we would ask him
yet" -- Judy.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa
Desjardins
at the Capitol.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, our own John Yang is
at the White
House.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, John, it was noted -- and
Lisa just reported
this -- the president today,
when asked about

08:36.883 --> 08:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Flynn, went out of his
way to praise
this man who essentially he just
fired yesterday,

08:42.088 --> 08:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we were told he'd lost faith
in him.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

08:45.692 --> 08:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made it sound as if the press
had fired
him. And Sean Spicer, the press
secretary,

08:49.763 --> 08:54.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said that there's no
contradiction between
admiring a man who served his
country in the

08:54.434 --> 08:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military, but losing trust in
him.

08:57.337 --> 09:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also went after the media,
calling it fake
news. We asked Sean Spicer, if
it hadn't been

09:03.276 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the stories, would Michael
Flynn still
be in the job? He said no,
because he had

09:07.881 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
misled the vice president, never
mind that
the vice president only learned
about that

09:12.385 --> 09:14.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from reading it in the
newspapers.

09:14.521 --> 09:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asked what was fake about the
stories, Sean
Spicer responded, "I will have
to get back

09:19.426 --> 09:21.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to you on that."

09:21.261 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, John, we
know separately
that -- now I'm trying to
remember what you

09:26.966 --> 09:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I were going to talk about
-- separately
-- oh, I know -- about the
successor to General

09:32.972 --> 09:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Flynn. What you have learned
about that?

09:34.774 --> 09:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Indications are that
the leading
contender is former Vice Admiral
Bob Harward.

09:40.280 --> 09:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former Navy SEAL. He was
a deputy to
the current defense secretary,
James Mattis,

09:46.686 --> 09:50.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when then-General Mattis ran
Central Command
for President Obama.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm told that an announcement
could come as
soon as the end of this week.

09:54.661 --> 09:59.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang
reporting for us
from the White House, thank you.

09:59.566 --> 10:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Russians rejected
any notion of returning Crimea
to Ukraine.

10:05.505 --> 10:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just yesterday, White House
spokesman Sean
Spicer said President Trump
expects exactly

10:10.276 --> 10:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. The Russians annexed
Crimea in March
of 2014, and, today, the Foreign
Ministry

10:15.915 --> 10:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Moscow said, "We never give
back our territory."

10:19.385 --> 10:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis issued a
pointed warning today to NATO
allies on defense

10:26.659 --> 10:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending. He said they will have
to do more,
or run the risk that the U.S.
will -- quote

10:31.965 --> 10:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "moderate its commitment to
the alliance."

10:35.068 --> 10:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattis attended his first NATO
defense ministers
meeting in Brussels and argued
President Trump's

10:40.607 --> 10:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case that the allies share more
of the burden.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: It's
a fair demand that all who
benefit from the

10:46.646 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best defense in the world carry
their proportionate
share of the necessary costs to
defend freedom.

10:53.586 --> 10:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should never forget,
ultimately, it
is freedom that we defend here
at NATO.

10:58.358 --> 11:02.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration wants
NATO members to meet an
established target

11:02.896 --> 11:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of spending 2 percent of their
economic output
on defense. The U.S. spends more
than 3.5

11:08.668 --> 11:10.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

11:10.503 --> 11:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Malaysia, police arrested a
woman in the
apparent assassination of Kim
Jong-nam, the

11:16.743 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estranged half-brother of North
Korea's supreme
leader. Malaysian news accounts
say two women

11:22.682 --> 11:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
splashed a chemical on him at
the Kuala Lumpur
Airport on Monday. U.S. and
South Korean officials

11:29.522 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say they were North Korea
agents. Meanwhile,
an autopsy on Kim's body began
today at this

11:35.662 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical institute in Malaysia.
That's despite
North Korean objections.

11:40.733 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The European Union's Parliament
approved a
landmark trade deal with Canada
today after

11:46.205 --> 11:52.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years of negotiations.
Supporters at the Parliament,
in Strasbourg, France, argued
that the deal

11:52.078 --> 11:57.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will counter rising
protectionism, while,
outside, hundreds of protesters
warned it

11:57.750 --> 11:59.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will do more harm than good.

11:59.519 --> 12:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARTIS PABRIKS, European People's
Party: We
made now a very historic trade
deal between

12:04.290 --> 12:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best partners in the world,
actually,
which we can find, because I
really believe

12:10.597 --> 12:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, apart from Canada, there
are very few
who match the standards of
common values outside

12:18.504 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

12:20.306 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It's a threat to
democracy, a threat
to human rights, a threat to the
environment.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I suppose that what we can
do now from
here is to put pressure on our
governments,

12:26.512 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put pressure on our MEPs to do
their job,
you know? And it's not over.
It's not over

12:31.884 --> 12:33.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
until it's over.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To be fully
implemented, the
trade deal will also need
approval from various

12:37.223 --> 12:40.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regional and national
parliaments across Europe.

12:40.927 --> 12:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China formally announced today
that it has
granted President Trump a
10-year trademark.

12:46.566 --> 12:52.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now has the exclusive right
to use his
name for building construction
services there

12:52.538 --> 12:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through 2027. Mr. Trump already
has 77 trademarks
in China. He has been trying to
gain this

12:58.911 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one for the last decade.

13:01.581 --> 13:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, nearly
3,000 workers
at Boeing voted on whether to
unionize their

13:06.352 --> 13:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plant in North Charleston, South
Carolina.
It is a key test for unions
trying to organize

13:12.325 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in factories across the South,
where most
workers are non-union. The vote
at Boeing

13:17.597 --> 13:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved the International
Association of
Machinists and Aerospace
Workers.

13:22.669 --> 13:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on Wall Street, stocks
rallied again
on upbeat news about consumer
prices and retail

13:29.008 --> 13:36.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sales. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained
107 points to close at 20611.
The Nasdaq rose

13:36.716 --> 13:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly 37, and the S&amp;P 500 added
11.

13:40.453 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I talk to
a former Trump adviser accused
of having ties

13:46.259 --> 13:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia; the president's
evolving approach
to Israel; and much more.

13:56.302 --> 14:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia; the president's
evolving approach
to Israel; and much more.

14:03.276 --> 14:08.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The swirl of questions
surrounding General
Flynn's resignation as national
security adviser,

14:08.715 --> 14:14.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the new reports of regular
contacts between
the Trump campaign and Russia,
has Democrats

14:14.854 --> 14:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Capitol Hill, as we heard,
calling for
an independent investigation.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of them is Senator Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota.

14:22.028 --> 14:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to her a short time ago,
and started
by asking what questions she
has.

14:26.065 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D),
Minnesota: Well, I
believe this is much more than
the resignation

14:30.403 --> 14:32.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of one national security
adviser.

14:32.739 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You already had the Trump
campaign chairman
step aside because of contacts
with Russia,

14:39.245 --> 14:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and now this new report that
there were multiple
contacts between people in the
campaign and

14:44.884 --> 14:50.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian intelligence people. So,
that's why
I think we have to get to the
bottom of it.

14:50.356 --> 14:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is about a fundamental
concept, and that
is a free democracy that should
be free from

14:57.497 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign influences. And we
already have had
our 17 intelligence agencies
tell us that

15:03.336 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's been an attempt to
influence our election.
And now we're finding out that
these contacts

15:09.142 --> 15:10.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were ongoing.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we need to know, who did
Flynn work with?
Who did he talk to? What did he
talk about

15:15.515 --> 15:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Russian ambassador? And,
also, why
was this happening? I think
that's the biggest

15:20.353 --> 15:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overriding question for our
national security.
Why was the Trump administration
so eager

15:25.992 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to placate the Russians and make
friends with
them, when they have done so
many horrific

15:31.164 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, including invading
countries that
are our allies?

15:33.966 --> 15:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have
information beyond
what's been reported in the
press about that?

15:38.304 --> 15:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I will
say, when
I was out with Senator McCain
and Graham in

15:42.508 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Baltics and Ukraine and
Georgia, I spent
a significant amount of time
with President

15:47.980 --> 15:49.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Poroshenko in Ukraine.

15:49.816 --> 15:55.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have the classified
information for
you to share, but I do have just
my experience

15:55.321 --> 15:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of learning that 10,000 people
were killed
there, of seeing that these
cyber-attacks

15:59.992 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been happening for years,
where it's
really the modus operandi of
Russia, where

16:04.931 --> 16:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have infiltrated Estonia's
system, Lithuania's
system.

16:08.935 --> 16:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what they do. They try
to bring down
these democracies with
cyber-attacks.

16:13.139 --> 16:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you think
this should
be investigated? We know that
the Senate Intelligence

16:17.376 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, the bipartisan
Intelligence Committee,
is looking into this. Are you
prepared to

16:21.948 --> 16:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave it at that, because some
Democrats have
said that it should be an
outside, independent

16:26.419 --> 16:27.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commission?

16:27.753 --> 16:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: I think we
can do both
at the same time.

16:30.323 --> 16:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Intelligence Committee is
important because
they're going to be able to get
underneath

16:34.894 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the surface with classified
information. Hopefully,
they can declassify some of it.
And then,

16:40.700 --> 16:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secondly, this independent
commission -- I
was one of the early sponsors of
this bill

16:45.037 --> 16:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and announced it with the
leaders of the bill,
because I think you need an
9/11-type commission

16:50.643 --> 16:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to really look at what happened,
so that you
can also make recommendations so
it doesn't

16:54.680 --> 16:55.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen in the future.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we can do both things at
once.

16:57.783 --> 17:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you need
an outside
commission? I mean, I talked
yesterday with

17:02.555 --> 17:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Mark Warner, who, of
course, is vice
chairman of that Intelligence
Committee. He

17:06.459 --> 17:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, at this point, he thinks
that the Intelligence
Committee itself can handle it.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well,
Senator Warner and
I are very good friends. And I
have full faith

17:13.766 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his leadership and those of
the other senators
on the committee.

17:17.236 --> 17:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the advantage of starting
this up, which
will, by the way, take a much
longer period

17:21.040 --> 17:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of time, is that you can put in
place some
experts that can look at this
really from

17:25.511 --> 17:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a different perspective. And
that's like the
9/11 Commission did. What
happened, and what

17:30.383 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steps can be taken, so we can
protect our
democracy and others in the
future?

17:34.487 --> 17:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also were
telling me, Senator
Klobuchar, that you and other
Democrats want

17:38.624 --> 17:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see the new attorney general,
Jeff Sessions,
recuse himself from any
investigation going

17:45.264 --> 17:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on inside the government. Why?

17:46.766 --> 17:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well,
there's actually
a specific rule on this, Judy.

17:50.403 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it says, no DOJ employee may
participate
in a criminal investigation or
prosecution

17:56.943 --> 18:03.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if he has a personal or
political relationship
with any person or organization
substantially

18:03.082 --> 18:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved in the conduct that is
the subject
of the investigation or
prosecution or would

18:09.121 --> 18:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be directly affected by the
outcome.

18:11.290 --> 18:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Sessions, who have I
worked with extensively
on the Judiciary Committee,
while I have had

18:16.729 --> 18:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a good working relationship with
him, he has
made it clear that he's not
going to take

18:21.434 --> 18:23.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on cases where there's
conflicts.

18:23.169 --> 18:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While he hasn't said that about
this case,
I don't know how you get around
it. He was

18:26.238 --> 18:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an early supporter of President
Trump. He
was involved in the campaign.
Flynn was involved

18:31.477 --> 18:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the campaign. And I just
think it's better
that he recuse himself, as does
Senator Feinstein

18:36.949 --> 18:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and many other members of the
Judiciary Committee.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, one
other thing. I'm
sure you know President Trump is
saying that

18:42.655 --> 18:46.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much of this is fabricated by
the news
media. He's saying the news
media is blowing

18:46.792 --> 18:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this out of proportion, that the
facts just
are not there to bear this out.

18:53.399 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's more upset about the
leaking on the
part of the intelligence
community than he

18:57.903 --> 19:00.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is about what the leaks
purportedly show.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: You know, he
has every
right to go after that leaking.
As you know,

19:04.243 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama did that as
well, although,
as Senator Corker said
yesterday, President

19:08.781 --> 19:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama ran a pretty tight ship.

19:10.516 --> 19:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are more leaks going
on than we
have during the -- practically
the entire

19:14.487 --> 19:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration. So, the
president has
a right to look into that.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not the big story here,
though. The
big story here is that the
national security

19:21.994 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser resigned after only 26
days, and that,
in this sea of problems with
Russia and the

19:29.135 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that we have got to stand
tall with our
allies, and that we have 17
intelligence agencies

19:34.240 --> 19:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- no one is making that up.

19:36.008 --> 19:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you would have to discount
the clear
evidence from 17 intelligence
agencies of

19:41.547 --> 19:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. government that this
had actually
occurred.

19:44.050 --> 19:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It occurred. It's a fact. And
the only question
now is how we respond to it.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota,
we thank you very much.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you,
Judy. It was
great to be on.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to a former
member of the Trump campaign
foreign policy

19:59.565 --> 20:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team, among those alleged to
have been in
contact with Russian officials.

20:04.737 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carter Page manages an energy
investment company,
and he joins me now.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Page, thank you for joining
us.

20:11.077 --> 20:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, briefly, start out by
telling us how you
knew or know Donald Trump. And
what kind of

20:15.948 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work did you do on the campaign
last year?

20:17.716 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE, Former Trump
Campaign Foreign
Policy Adviser: You know, I --
it's funny.

20:21.220 --> 20:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were just talking about
leaks with your
former -- former interviewee.

20:28.961 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't talk about the internal
works that
I did to help the campaign. I --
I was a junior

20:37.470 --> 20:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
member of the campaign's foreign
policy advisory
group, and I didn't -- had --
you know, compared

20:48.013 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to other people that were much
-- had much
more direct interaction with Mr.
Trump, who

20:54.420 --> 20:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I never actually briefed or was
in any small
meetings with.

20:59.825 --> 21:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to many rallies with him,
but never
any direct meetings. So, you
know, I think

21:06.499 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a tendency to talk about
a lot of
internal dealings in the U.S.
government,

21:13.038 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as you were talking about.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
just...

21:15.574 --> 21:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: And I think -- yes.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just move
on by saying,
but you were a member of his
foreign policy

21:19.879 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team. We were just talking about
that a moment
ago.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARTER PAGE: Yes.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my first
question, then,
after that, Carter Page, is to
ask you, you're

21:27.786 --> 21:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aware of these reports out there
that there
were officials in the Trump
campaign who were

21:34.126 --> 21:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in repeated contact with Russian
officials,
Russian intelligence officials
during 2016.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you one of those campaign
officials?

21:44.937 --> 21:53.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: Well, Judy, you
know, that -- going
back to the question to Sean
Spicer about

21:53.445 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fake news, I mean, this -- yes,
I'm aware
of the reports, which I saw on
the front page

21:59.485 --> 22:01.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The New York Times today.

22:01.387 --> 22:07.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think I can actually
answer that question
as to why that was fake news.
That was just

22:07.359 --> 22:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a regurgitation of old reports,
based on the
dodgy dossier that the Clinton
campaign out

22:14.400 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in other
words...

22:17.169 --> 22:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: So, yes, I'm aware
-- I'm aware
of these ongoing public
relations attacks

22:21.540 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the administration and
people who
have supported it. But...

22:26.011 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
stop and
say the reports are citing
intelligence agencies.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're talking about the CIA,
the FBI.

22:34.253 --> 22:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're saying these agencies
are not to
be believed, or the news media
is making this

22:41.694 --> 22:42.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up, or what?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:44.496 --> 22:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: Well, what I'm
saying, what I'm
saying is, you know, at least
last year, they

22:47.967 --> 22:55.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were responding to false
evidence, which is
an obstruction of justice, false
evidence

22:55.107 --> 23:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given to the Intelligence
Committee -- intelligence
community by the Clinton
campaign.

23:01.113 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now that's pretty
well-established, you know,
with this dodgy dossier that
came out last

23:06.418 --> 23:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month. So, I think it's pretty
clear evidence.

23:08.921 --> 23:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, in terms of it
being fake news
today, the big front-page story
on The New

23:14.560 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times, I actually sent them
a copy of
a real dossier that I submitted
to the Civil

23:20.766 --> 23:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rights Division of the U.S.
Department of
Justice over the weekend.

23:24.770 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately -- to one of
the authors
of that front-page article --
and that never

23:30.009 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got included at all. So, you
know, it's -- it's
very one-sided.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:35.447 --> 23:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We only have a
limited amount
of time here, so I want to use
this time to

23:40.419 --> 23:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone's advantage, and ask
you, you were
in Russia. You have worked in
Russia for a

23:44.723 --> 23:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of years. You clearly
know Russian
officials.

23:48.294 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where do you think this comes
from? Were you
in any kind of contact last year
with Russian

23:54.833 --> 23:56.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government officials?

23:56.702 --> 24:03.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: It comes from deep
animosity
and deep negative feelings
against the Russians.

24:03.208 --> 24:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, you know, you just
have to look
back at the history of the last
70 years,

24:07.880 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's pretty clear where that
originates
from.

24:11.583 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mrs. Clinton and her team
did a great
job of ramping that up. And it
continues to

24:17.589 --> 24:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this day, with the help of the
likes of Sally
Yates and others that were
holdovers from

24:22.828 --> 24:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama administration.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
-- so, you're
saying that that, whatever you
-- what you

24:27.433 --> 24:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
describe as animosity toward the
Russians
is not deserved.

24:31.036 --> 24:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard Senator Amy
Klobuchar talk about
the Russians having the kind of
an agenda

24:35.574 --> 24:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the U.S. could never share,
that they're
undermining democracies across
Eastern Europe.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't agree with that view
of Russia?

24:43.749 --> 24:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: I view it as a
two-way street.

24:46.752 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, what I talked
about in my speech
in Moscow in July, and what
President Trump

24:53.092 --> 24:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Putin talked about
in their
initial call, was the concept of
mutual respect.

24:59.164 --> 25:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if both sides are
acting respectfully
and really thinking through and
understanding

25:04.403 --> 25:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other side's perspectives,
that takes
care of a lot of it.

25:08.073 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, absolutely, there
-- you know,
the senator is right that
there's a lot of

25:11.944 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that need to be repaired.
But I think
continuing these fake news, fake
intel reports

25:17.883 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is only going to continue
driving us into
the gutter.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you have any
meetings -- I
will ask again -- did you have
any meetings

25:24.022 --> 25:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year with Russian officials
in Russia,
outside Russia, anywhere?

25:29.061 --> 25:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: I had no meetings,
no meetings.

25:32.364 --> 25:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I might have said hello to a few
people as
they were walking by me at my
graduation -- the

25:38.237 --> 25:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graduation speech that I gave in
July, but
no meetings.

25:42.174 --> 25:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in other
words, these reports
that are citing, in very
specific detail,

25:50.416 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what intelligence agencies say
they have discovered,
continuous, repeated contacts
between the

25:56.655 --> 26:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign and Russia, you're
saying that's
entirely made up? Is that what
you're saying?

26:01.059 --> 26:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: Judy, I don't think
they said
discovered. I think they -- that
they're looking

26:05.798 --> 26:07.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at it.

26:07.599 --> 26:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a nice way for the
enemies of the
administration and the enemies
of positive

26:11.970 --> 26:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.-Russia relations to keep
stirring this
negative pot over and over
again.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

26:18.677 --> 26:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: And, admittedly,
they have done
quite a good job over the last
year. So, I

26:20.779 --> 26:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to -- I have to hand it to
them as excellent
politicians.

26:23.148 --> 26:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are you
cooperating with
any federal investigators who
are looking

26:27.219 --> 26:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into this? Have you been asked,
for example,
by the FBI or another agency to
answer questions?

26:32.024 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you were called on to go
before, say,
a Senate committee
investigation, would you

26:37.029 --> 26:38.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be willing to do that?

26:38.897 --> 26:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: I have never been
asked by anyone
in the FBI or any of the other
agencies over

26:45.003 --> 26:46.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the last year.

26:46.805 --> 26:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, yes, I would love
to have the
opportunity to speak with the
Senate. And

26:53.712 --> 26:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have offered to a few of the
senators to
speak with them and maybe offer
them some

26:58.784 --> 27:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realistic views of actually
what's happening
in the world. But I think, you
know, there's

27:03.655 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- there's a great level of
ignorance.

27:05.524 --> 27:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so one question to ask your
other senators
you speak to is, have they ever
actually stepped

27:10.462 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foot in Russia or talked to
Russian people?
And I think, you know, that's
very strong

27:15.834 --> 27:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correlation with the ignorance
that you see
today...

27:18.537 --> 27:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
finally..

27:19.538 --> 27:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: ... due to the lack
of knowledge.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sorry. Excuse me.

27:22.674 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just very quickly, finally, what
should the
U.S. relationship with Russia
be? You're clearly

27:26.411 --> 27:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arguing for something far more
positive than
what exists right now.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: I'm not saying
positive.

27:33.151 --> 27:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm saying more practical and
realistic and
just having a open, respectful
dialogue, in

27:40.859 --> 27:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which you really think about the
other side
and, you know, look to build
your own country

27:46.932 --> 27:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up here in the United States
through better,
positive relations, and not
getting swirled

27:53.305 --> 28:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of control with these
ongoing distractions,
which are taking away attention
from bigger

28:00.245 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security threats and
causing disruptions,
great -- very unfortunately, for
the United

28:06.885 --> 28:08.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think there's a lot of
work to be done.
And I think Russia can be a
tremendous ally

28:12.524 --> 28:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for helping in that regard.

28:14.326 --> 28:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carter Page,
former foreign
policy adviser to the Trump
campaign, thank

28:20.299 --> 28:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you very much for talking with
us.

28:24.169 --> 28:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE: Thanks, Judy.

28:29.908 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:37.115 --> 28:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
scientists scramble
to back up data they say is
threatened by

28:42.354 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump administration; and
the debate over
carrying guns on campus 50 years
after a shooting

28:49.361 --> 28:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the University of Texas.

28:52.531 --> 28:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now to the president's
meeting with Israel's
prime minister at the White
House today, and

28:57.536 --> 29:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it means for the U.S. role
in the Israeli-Palestinian
relationship.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

29:03.976 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I'm looking at two-state and
one-state, and

29:07.279 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I like the one that both parties
like.

29:09.881 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With that,
President Trump
served notice that he is not
wedded to longstanding

29:14.886 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. support for a two-state
solution to resolve
the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu at his side.

29:22.628 --> 29:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I thought for a
while the two-state
looked like it may be the easier
of the two.

29:27.666 --> 29:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, honestly, if Israel and the
Palestinians
are happy, I'm happy with the
one they like

29:33.305 --> 29:35.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the best.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
urged a wider
peace pact as well, involving
other Middle

29:37.776 --> 29:39.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Eastern countries.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: And it is
something that is
very different, hasn't been
discussed before.

29:44.016 --> 29:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's actually a much bigger
deal, a much
more important deal, in a sense.

29:48.420 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Trump also
left open
the possibility of moving the
U.S. Embassy

29:52.824 --> 29:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
despite Palestinian
demands that East Jerusalem be
their capital.

29:59.097 --> 30:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Netanyahu called for the U.S.
and Israel to
seize this moment, and he laid
out his conditions

30:03.769 --> 30:05.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for peace.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
First, the Palestinians must
recognize the

30:07.339 --> 30:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jewish state. They have to stop
calling for
Israel's destruction. Second, in
any peace

30:13.545 --> 30:19.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement, Israel must retain
the overriding
security control of the entire
area west of

30:19.851 --> 30:21.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Jordan River.

30:21.687 --> 30:25.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Palestinians vehemently
oppose that second element. They
also flatly

30:25.290 --> 30:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reject Israel's ramped-up
construction in
Jewish settlements in the West
Bank. That

30:29.995 --> 30:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point elicited this exchange
today.

30:31.863 --> 30:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to see
you hold back
on settlements for a little bit.
We'll work

30:37.069 --> 30:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something out. But I would like
to see a deal
be made. I think a deal will be
made.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So let's see what we do.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Let's try
it.

30:46.078 --> 30:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't sound too
optimistic,
but he's a good negotiator.

30:50.615 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:51.616 --> 30:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Netanyahu
later added:

30:53.452 --> 30:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I believe
that the issue
of the settlements is not the
core of the

30:57.089 --> 31:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflict, nor does it really
drive the conflict.
I think it's an issue that has
to be resolved

31:01.426 --> 31:05.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the context of peace
negotiations, and
we also are going to speak about
it.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As the two
leaders talked
at the White House, Palestinian
officials

31:08.867 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say President Mahmoud Abbas met
secretly Tuesday
night with CIA Chief Mike Pompeo
in the West

31:14.306 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bank city of Ramallah.

31:16.608 --> 31:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to delve further into
the news
out of today's White House news
conference,

31:20.078 --> 31:24.883 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
and where the
Israeli-Palestinian issue stands
at the beginning of the Trump
administration,

31:24.916 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are Shibley Telhami. He's the
Anwar Sadat
professor for peace and
development at the

31:29.020 --> 31:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University of Maryland. And
Tamara Cofman
Wittes, she's a senior fellow in
the Middle

31:34.359 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East Policy Center at the
Brookings Institution,
and she served as deputy
assistant secretary

31:38.497 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state for near eastern
affairs in the Obama
administration from November of
2009 to January

31:44.102 --> 31:45.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2012.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shibley, I want to start with
you.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What did both of these leaders
get out of
this, before they even begin to
having conversations?

31:49.775 --> 31:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIBLEY TELHAMI, Anwar Sadat
Professor for
Peace and Development,
University of Maryland:

31:52.477 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
First, domestically.

31:54.446 --> 31:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Netanyahu is obviously
looking back home.
He is in trouble in an
investigation on corruption.

31:59.284 --> 32:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is being pressured from the
ultra-right.
So, he wants to show, at a time
when Israelis

32:05.056 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are uncertain about where the
president is
going to, where President Trump
is going to

32:08.293 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go, he wants to show that he can
make a deal
with the president, that he can
have a working

32:15.267 --> 32:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship with him, that he
can deliver.
It helps him at home.

32:17.836 --> 32:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Mr. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu is
very popular
in the Republican Party. In my
polls actually,

32:24.676 --> 32:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's up there with Ronald Reagan
as one of
the most popular leaders in the
world, and

32:28.079 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially among the evangelical
right.

32:30.515 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just by virtue of looking
like they're
cordial in the photo-op, they
both score points

32:35.654 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at home. Obviously, they also
score points
on some issues that we knew they
would score

32:40.592 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points on, for example, the
stated American
support for Israeli security,
the fight on

32:46.097 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terrorism, the Iran issue.

32:47.999 --> 32:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are issues where there
isn't much difference,
at least rhetorically. And those
obviously

32:53.305 --> 32:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the ones that register. But,
then, of
course, we turn to the more
central question

32:58.343 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where there will be inevitably
some disagreements,
the Israel and Palestinian
question.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:03.682 --> 33:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes. That's
right.

33:05.417 --> 33:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara Wittes, I want to get to
you with that,
the one-state, two-state
statement by the

33:09.621 --> 33:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president today. The U.S. has
always been
committed to a peaceful
resolution to this,

33:13.792 --> 33:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but why is the president's
announcement today
so important?

33:16.461 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA COFMAN WITTES, Brookings
Institution:
Well, look, I think it's always
been the American

33:20.699 --> 33:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position, enunciated previously
by the U.S.
presidents, that we can't want
peace more

33:25.637 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the parties themselves, and
that the
parties have to agree to a
solution of their

33:30.809 --> 33:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conflict, and we will support
them in doing
that.

33:33.745 --> 33:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's changed here is that, for
a long time,
under President George W. Bush,
and then under

33:38.683 --> 33:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, the U.S. has
agreed with
both parties that a two-state
solution, that

33:45.891 --> 33:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, independent, sovereign
states for Israel
and for Palestine, is the only
stable, lasting

33:54.165 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solution for peace in the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

33:57.535 --> 34:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump suggested
that there might
be some other outcome that could
deliver a

34:02.240 --> 34:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lasting peace. And that does
throw into question
the objective of any
negotiations.

34:07.212 --> 34:12.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIBLEY TELHAMI: If I may add on
this one,
just in terms of what is missing
here, what

34:12.350 --> 34:17.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is missing is, when the
statement is, it's
up to the parties to negotiate,
with no reference

34:17.656 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to international law or previous
agreements
or some framework, you're
leaving it up to

34:22.761 --> 34:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Israelis and Palestinians, a
very unequal
relationship.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to be able to
do this on
their own, without reference to
what has been

34:29.668 --> 34:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreed or some ground rule.
That's number
one.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number two, the president throws
in there
the one state. He only gives two
alternatives,

34:36.975 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two states, one state. Well, if
you have one
state, it can be only one of two
days ways,

34:41.947 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a Jewish state, democratic
states for
Arabs and Jews, but not a Jewish
state, or

34:46.318 --> 34:48.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an apartheid state.

34:48.119 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, if Obama had put
that proposal
on the table just like Trump
stated it, he

34:53.425 --> 34:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have been attacked from
all over the
place from the right by
suggesting the one-state

34:59.064 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
solution could be on the table.

35:00.865 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, this one is really
interesting, because
you have got some agreements
both on the left

35:05.603 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and right about the
impossibility of a two-state,
but what they want is something
completely

35:11.943 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Shibley
Telhami, just staying
with you for a second, is a
one-state solution

35:16.081 --> 35:17.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a nonstarter for the
Palestinians?

35:18.016 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIBLEY TELHAMI: No, it's not a
nonstarter,
even though, I think, for many
of them, obviously,

35:22.787 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they don't think it as
realistic. When you
ask them, do you think it's
going to happen,

35:25.890 --> 35:27.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most say no.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they think they can -- if
they can
have a full, equal relationship
with Israel,

35:30.862 --> 35:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, of course they would,
because, ultimately,
that will be a majority. That's
not a nonstarter.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's a nonstarter if they're
not going
to have equal relations.

35:37.702 --> 35:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is a nonstarter for the
Israelis, undoubtedly.

35:40.405 --> 35:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara Wittes,
both men
said that the goal might be more
achievable

35:44.743 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if more regional partners got
involved. What
are the possible repercussions
if there are

35:48.413 --> 35:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more people at the table?

35:50.215 --> 35:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA COFMAN WITTES: Well,
look, I think
this is an idea that has
actually been tossed

35:54.019 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
around for a while. It's
something that President
Bush and Secretary Condoleezza
Rice tried

35:58.957 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do at their Annapolis
conference, bring
together the region as a whole,
partly to

36:03.328 --> 36:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compensate for Palestinian
weakness, and to
put more on the table that's
attractive to

36:09.901 --> 36:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel, in terms of regional
security and
stability and regional
cooperation.

36:15.006 --> 36:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in principle, expanding the
pie actually
does give you more options for
resolving the

36:20.678 --> 36:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflict. In practice, however,
the Arab states
have made clear over and over
again that they

36:25.216 --> 36:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not going to get in front of
the Palestinians
in solving this conflict. They
are going to

36:29.320 --> 36:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go where the Palestinians are
willing to go,
and not beyond.

36:32.924 --> 36:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still don't see any reason to
think that
that has changed. And so I think
this sort

36:37.695 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of outside-in approach will last
only as long
as the Arab governments think
that the Palestinians

36:43.835 --> 36:45.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want it to last.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Shibley
Telhami, is there
-- Prime Minister Netanyahu
started saying

36:48.473 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today that basically there are
lots of things
that he has in common with Arab
states, say,

36:52.577 --> 36:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for example, their fear of a
more powerful
Iran.

36:56.648 --> 37:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would all of these Arab states,
in that shared
fear or concern with Israel,
would they put

37:02.087 --> 37:03.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Palestinian state on the
back-burner?

37:03.922 --> 37:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIBLEY TELHAMI: First, he's
right that there
are a lot of common interests.
And that shows.

37:08.393 --> 37:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, you know, the
president of
Egypt, the king of Jordan, the
leader of the

37:15.100 --> 37:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UAE, they have some cooperative
relationships
strategically, whether it's on
Iran or fighting

37:20.772 --> 37:22.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorism.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, they all have working
relations
with Trump, and even with Putin,
as the president

37:26.478 --> 37:30.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Russia. So, in some ways, you
have this
kind of strategic picture.

37:30.682 --> 37:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the big elephant in the room
is the Israel-Palestine
question. It always has been. As
Tamara said,

37:35.587 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can put -- if it weren't for
that, of
course, then you can have it.

37:40.091 --> 37:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what Netanyahu wants to do
is to show
to the Israeli public that he
can build settlements

37:46.598 --> 37:51.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and not really make the
concessions that are
needed on the Palestinian issue,
and still

37:51.169 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make peace with the Arab states.
And he wants
Trump to help him.

37:55.173 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, one of the -- that's the
way that Arabs
have interpreted historically.
Well, interestingly,

37:59.310 --> 38:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the news conference today,
look at the
body language. Netanyahu was the
one to say,

38:04.149 --> 38:09.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is essentially my plan that
I taught
Trump to advocate, instead of
letting it even

38:09.287 --> 38:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look like a Trump plan, because
his interest
is ultimately to send a message
at home that

38:13.992 --> 38:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's the one who is making Trump
do it, rather
than to have the Arabs have a
fig leaf to

38:18.796 --> 38:20.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come on board.

38:20.598 --> 38:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think many of them might play
with Trump.
They don't want to say no to
him. They have

38:23.601 --> 38:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own self-interests to want
to play.
The Saudis remain a big
question. But, ultimately,

38:29.974 --> 38:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when push comes to
shove, the Palestinian
issue may be just a fig leaf for
something

38:35.213 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other than Israeli-Palestinian
peace.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Shibley Telhami.

38:38.683 --> 38:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA COFMAN WITTES: Yes.

38:39.684 --> 38:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm sorry.

38:40.785 --> 38:41.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Wittes, very quickly, you
want to wrap
up?

38:41.686 --> 38:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA COFMAN WITTES: Sure.

38:43.555 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to add, I think that what
is really bringing
Israel and the Arab states
together right

38:46.157 --> 38:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is a common sense of threat.
It's not
necessarily a common vision for
the region's

38:50.929 --> 38:52.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

38:52.463 --> 38:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Tamara Wittes,
Shibley Telhami, thank you both.

38:55.967 --> 39:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIBLEY TELHAMI: Thank you.

39:06.211 --> 39:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Almost since the
day President
Trump was sworn in, members of a
loosely aligned

39:15.920 --> 39:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grassroots movement composed of
academics,
programmers, researchers and
scientists have

39:21.793 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been archiving government data
they fear could
disappear.

39:26.331 --> 39:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien looks in on one of
those efforts
for our weekly science series,
Leading Edge.

39:32.237 --> 39:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEROME WHITINGTON, New York
University: Psyched
to see everybody in the room.
Really exciting.

39:39.510 --> 39:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's early, cold,
and Saturday,
and yet this room at New York
University is

39:45.283 --> 39:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing room only. A few
hundred volunteers
are here to download and save
scientific data

39:51.756 --> 39:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created and curated by the
federal government.

39:55.059 --> 39:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME WHITINGTON: Without the
data, you don't
have environmental regulation.

39:58.496 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Anthropology
Professor Jerome
Whitington is one of the
organizers of this

40:02.967 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data rescue event, the eighth in
an ongoing,
open-ended series which began
after the election.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEROME WHITINGTON: Now, one of
the things
we're going to accomplish at
this event is,

40:11.709 --> 40:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to do a lot of work
to get hard-to-access
data sets, things that previous
events have

40:17.382 --> 40:19.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
struggled to get.

40:19.284 --> 40:23.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are focused
primarily
on the essential science used to
create environmental

40:23.855 --> 40:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations. They worry the
Trump administration's
anti-regulatory bent and
outright denial of

40:30.128 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peer-reviewed climate science
might put the
data in jeopardy.

40:34.299 --> 40:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEROME WHITINGTON: We're less
worried about
it being outright deleted and
disappearing,

40:39.270 --> 40:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more worried about it
becoming unusable
or inaccessible in specific
ways.

40:43.541 --> 40:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, they are
systematically
building a data refuge in the
cloud on servers

40:49.480 --> 40:52.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hosted by Amazon.

40:52.483 --> 40:57.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bethany Wiggin directs the
University of Pennsylvania
program in environmental
humanities. She is

40:57.689 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an organizer of the data refuge
project.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANY WIGGIN, University of
Pennsylvania:
We have always thought of data
refuge as providing

41:03.995 --> 41:11.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an insurance policy. The
situation is quite
urgent. Events on the federal
level are moving

41:11.969 --> 41:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly. The changes being made
to programs
is happening quite fast. The
situation is

41:18.976 --> 41:20.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very uncertain.

41:20.745 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Federally funded
science has
been maligned and cut back
before, but the

41:25.483 --> 41:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump administration has upped
the ante. While
no huge data sets have
completely disappeared,

41:32.623 --> 41:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some have been made harder to
access or even
find.

41:36.594 --> 41:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The official White House Web
site no longer
contains any reference to
climate change.

41:42.900 --> 41:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Trump space adviser threatened
to pull the
plug on earth science at NASA.
Department

41:48.406 --> 41:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Energy scientists received a
questionnaire
asking what climate change
conferences they

41:53.845 --> 41:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attended and what materials they
shared.

41:57.582 --> 42:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president's choice to
run the EPA,
Oklahoma Attorney General Scott
Pruitt, sued

42:03.254 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the agency 13 times and tried to
block Obama
administration climate change
regulations.

42:13.064 --> 42:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders
grilled Pruitt
at his confirmation hearing.

42:17.301 --> 42:21.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I),
Vermont: Ninety-seven
percent of the scientists who
wrote articles

42:21.539 --> 42:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in peer-reviewed journals
believe that human
activity is the fundamental
reason we are

42:28.546 --> 42:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing climate change. You
disagree with that?

42:30.715 --> 42:33.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT PRUITT (R), EPA
Administrator Nominee:
I believe the ability to measure
with precision

42:33.851 --> 42:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the degree of human activity's
impact on the
climate is subject to more
debate on whether

42:38.556 --> 42:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the climate is changing or
whether human activity
contributes to it.

42:41.092 --> 42:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For his part, Mr.
Trump has
tweeted that climate change is a
hoax cooked

42:45.730 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up by the Chinese, and
repeatedly criticized
federal environmental
regulations.

42:50.468 --> 42:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I believe strongly in clean
water and clean

42:54.539 --> 42:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air, but I don't believe that
what they say
-- I think it's a big scam for a
lot of people

42:59.410 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make a lot of money. In the
meantime, China
is eating our lunch because they
don't partake

43:05.082 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in all the rules and regulations
that we do.

members.

43:26.537 --> 43:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSH HOLT: When they hear public
officials
talk about alternative facts,
they're aghast.

43:37.048 --> 43:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they don't know what a
new administration
is going to do in support for
research, they

43:44.222 --> 43:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get very apprehensive about
their ability
to continue to do the research
that they think

43:51.395 --> 43:53.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is so valuable.

43:53.197 --> 43:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Holt was among
the witnesses
when the House Science Committee
conducted

43:56.901 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its first hearing of the Trump
era. No one
was surprised that the
Environmental Protection

44:02.340 --> 44:04.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Agency was the focus.

44:04.742 --> 44:09.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican chairman of the
committee,
Lamar Smith of Texas, is a
longtime, staunch

44:09.947 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
critic of the EPA.

44:11.682 --> 44:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. LAMAR SMITH (R), Texas:
There is now
an opportunity to right the ship
at the EPA

44:15.686 --> 44:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and steer the agency in the
right direction.
The EPA should be open and
accountable to

44:21.025 --> 44:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the American people and use
legitimate science.

44:24.295 --> 44:30.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSH HOLT: Scientists are
fiercely independent.
They would resent horribly if
they felt their

44:30.468 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work was being manipulated. It's
not.

44:33.170 --> 44:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Also testifying
that day, the
EPA's deputy administrator under
George W.

44:39.076 --> 44:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bush, Jeff Holmstead. He is a
partner at Bracewell,
a Houston-based law firm that
represents corporate

44:46.217 --> 44:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clients in the energy sector.

44:48.386 --> 44:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF HOLMSTEAD, Bracewell: EPA
tends to focus
on the science that supports the
regulatory

44:54.625 --> 44:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role that it sees for itself,
and sometimes
doesn't pay enough attention to
science that

44:59.931 --> 45:01.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cuts the other way.

45:01.732 --> 45:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it would be valuable to
EPA if they
had a more balanced perspective
on a lot of

45:09.040 --> 45:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these scientific questions that
they're looking
at.

45:10.975 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While scientists
wait to see
what shoes might drop, a rumor
mill echoes

45:16.080 --> 45:18.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the Twitterverse.

45:18.649 --> 45:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most agencies are laying low,
avoiding controversy
in public channels. The EPA's
last official

45:24.822 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tweet was the day before the
inauguration.

45:27.892 --> 45:34.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, alternative, or
rogue, accounts
emerge constantly, some
apparently authored

45:34.332 --> 45:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by worried employees inside
agencies, others
by sympathetic, connected
outsiders. They

45:41.272 --> 45:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are flares from a science
community under
siege.

45:45.042 --> 45:48.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are scientists in a panic? Is
that what it
is? What's going on?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH COWING, NASA Watch: They
know where
the panic button is, and they
look at it once

45:50.848 --> 45:52.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or twice a day.

45:52.683 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Keith Cowing is a
former NASA
biologist who founded the
watchdog Web site

45:57.321 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA Watch 20 years ago. He's
the proto-rogue,
and now he says everybody seems
to be joining

46:04.362 --> 46:06.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

46:06.263 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH COWING: Nobody has said,
shut that database
down, take that off your Web
site. But what's

46:10.001 --> 46:17.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to happen when you have
got this giant,
bubbling, simmering social media
crowd, and

46:17.208 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they go from being worried about
things that
might happen to things that are
happening?

46:21.879 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a colossal hair trigger
waiting out
there.

46:24.582 --> 46:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the meantime,
data refuge
is as much therapeutic as it is
prophylactic.

46:31.889 --> 46:35.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Programmer Brendan O'Brien -- no
relation
-- showed me how they're doing
their work.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN O'BRIEN, Programmer: The
toughest
part about this is figuring out
what this

46:39.730 --> 46:44.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all means and to be able to
archive it in
a sensible form.

46:44.969 --> 46:51.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Data refuge
organizers sent
questionnaires to 65,000
scientists to determine

46:51.108 --> 46:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to prioritize the gargantuan
task.

46:54.712 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, they have received 7,500
responses.
As they march through the
databases, they

47:00.985 --> 47:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are simultaneously developing
tools to organize
the effort, protect the
integrity of the data,

47:07.458 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and make an app for widespread
use.

47:09.860 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN O'BRIEN: If we have the
foresight
to back the stuff up now, we may
be -- maybe

47:14.532 --> 47:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
later generations will thank us.

47:16.367 --> 47:21.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists are
also planning
a public campaign to save their
enterprise.

47:21.372 --> 47:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On April 22, Earth Day, they
intend to march
en masse on Washington, an
experiment to test

47:29.113 --> 47:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the volatile interaction between
pressure,
politics, belief, and facts.

JUDY WOODRUFF: This week,
"Independent Lens"
on PBS is presenting a
captivating reexamination

47:55.773 --> 47:59.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of America's first mass school
shooting.

47:59.210 --> 48:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Tower" includes archival
footage, new animation
and untold witness stories who
unpack the

48:05.483 --> 48:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
horror that left 16 dead and
three dozen wounded
at the University of Texas,
Austin, in 1966.

48:12.823 --> 48:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Texas is one of nine
states that allow
concealed weapons to be carried
on public

48:19.530 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college campuses, prompting
vigorous debate,
as we see in this "Independent
Lens" extra.

48:25.636 --> 48:34.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK ROLAND, Student: My name is
Nick Roland.
I'm a Ph.D student here at U.T.
Should be

48:34.445 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduating this year with a
degree in U.S.
history. Went to Virginia Tech
for undergrad.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was active-duty Army for
four years.

48:42.653 --> 48:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My routine is just like anyone
else. You know,
I get up, eat breakfast. The
only difference

48:46.857 --> 48:51.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that I put a handgun in my
bag before I
get on my bike and ride to
campus.

48:51.729 --> 49:00.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is it. I know that it's
loaded. It's
got the loaded chamber
indicator. So, then

49:00.037 --> 49:07.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just going to place it here.

49:07.077 --> 49:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once I get to campus, typically
going to go
somewhere where I can discreetly
put my weapon

49:11.849 --> 49:20.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on my hip. And I'm just going to
holster it
and then place it right here on
my hip.

MICHAEL CARGILL, Owner, Central
Texas Gun
Works: Campus carry went into
effect August

49:25.129 --> 49:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 1st of 2016, which means
that a person
with a handgun license can now
carry a handgun,

49:30.868 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concealed, inside of a building
of a college
campus.

49:34.772 --> 49:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Michael Cargill. I'm
the owner
of Central Texas Gun Works,
which is a gun

49:37.541 --> 49:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
store here in Austin, Texas. I
carry a .45,
a .38 Special, and a
.9-millimeter. I love

49:42.079 --> 49:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. I like walking to the
grocery store. I
like going to the movie
theaters. I like going

49:46.483 --> 49:48.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to all those places.

49:48.152 --> 49:52.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now finally we can carry
those same facilities
on a college campus. Woo-hoo!

49:52.223 --> 49:53.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

49:53.224 --> 49:54.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:54.625 --> 49:58.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANA LOPEZ, Student: Hey, how do
you all feel
about guns on campus?

49:58.662 --> 49:59.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Weird.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANA LOPEZ: Come support Students
Against Campus
Carry.

50:02.366 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Ana Lopez. I'm a
sophomore at the
University of Texas. And I'm
vice president

50:07.438 --> 50:09.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Students Against Campus Carry
at U.T.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Invite your friends to stop by
and sign up.

50:12.009 --> 50:17.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A college campus is somewhere
where you should
be able to argue with someone
and have different

50:17.448 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beliefs. And in the presence of
guns, my freedom
of speech personally is totally
stifled.

50:23.087 --> 50:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The final version is due
Tuesday in class?

50:26.590 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA MOORE, Professor,
University of Texas,
Austin: I'm Lisa Moore and I'm a
professor

50:28.659 --> 50:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of English and women's and
gender studies
here at the University of Texas,
Austin.

50:32.930 --> 50:38.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campus carry law makes it
really hard
for us to do our jobs as
instructors. Students

50:38.469 --> 50:44.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are allowed to bring guns to my
classroom.
I really consider that
interchange of teaching

50:45.009 --> 50:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and learning that happens in a
college classroom
to be something of a sacred
vocation.

50:49.413 --> 50:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has introduced a level of
tension, a level
of wariness into the classroom
setting that

50:56.620 --> 51:00.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just find kind of
heartbreaking, frankly.

51:00.491 --> 51:03.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Fire.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNSHOTS)

51:04.962 --> 51:11.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And this is about their
personal safety.
They are civilians that are
carrying the firearm

51:11.602 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for personal protection.

51:13.437 --> 51:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM LEHRER, PBS: More than 30
people were
shot to death today at Virginia
Tech University

51:17.808 --> 51:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Blacksburg, Virginia. It was
the deadliest
mass shooting in American
history.

51:22.646 --> 51:27.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK ROLAND: I was a senior that
year when
it happened. It was hard because
I really

51:27.952 --> 51:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loved Virginia Tech. And I think
it's a really
special campus and community.
So, yes, it

51:34.358 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was shocking, traumatic. It felt
like somebody
had attacked my family.

51:39.596 --> 51:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Had someone in one of those
classrooms been
armed, I think it would have
made a difference,

51:43.567 --> 51:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly. People do deserve to
have a fighting
chance. And the concealed carry
gives them

51:49.106 --> 51:52.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another option for self-defense
in that type
of situation.

51:52.176 --> 51:57.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANA LOPEZ: I debated with Nick,
like, a couple
months ago. And I get it. And I
can't put

51:57.181 --> 51:58.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
myself in his situation

51:58.983 --> 52:03.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But causing everybody else to
live in fear
like you is counterproductive.
People often

52:03.654 --> 52:11.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forget that my university was
the site for
the first recorded mass shooting
in U.S. history.

52:11.095 --> 52:13.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's usually brushed under
the rug.

52:13.130 --> 52:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMIRO MARTINEZ, Retired Texas
Ranger: Here's
where some of the bullets hit.

52:19.636 --> 52:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Ramiro Martinez. Back
in 1966,
I was with the Austin Police
Department. Together,

52:24.875 --> 52:27.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with other officers, we took
down the sniper.

52:27.878 --> 52:35.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right here is where he died.
And, at that
time, I started waving the
shotgun and hollering

52:35.853 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down below, "Stop shooting." But
they kept
shooting.

52:42.459 --> 52:51.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been asked about my
opinion about concealed
handgun campus carry. And I'm
against it.

52:51.035 --> 52:57.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we don't need young people,
who are just
a little over 21, probably a
little bit immature,

52:57.374 --> 53:00.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be carrying guns on the

53:11.155 --> 53:14.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

know him from Adam, I might have
