TODAY, OUR TOP STORY WAS THE

00:02.969 --> 00:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAILED COUP ATTEMPT IN TURKEY BY

00:07.440 --> 00:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERDOGAN.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE HIS SECURITY FORCES

00:09.642 --> 00:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STOPPED THE COUP, ERDOGAN HAS

00:11.378 --> 00:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRACKED DOWN ON PERCEIVED

00:13.013 --> 00:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

00:18.351 --> 00:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, HIS GOVERNMENT FIRED

00:19.619 --> 00:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
7,000 MORE AS ERDOGAN ATTENDED A

00:28.261 --> 00:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE COUP.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PAST YEAR, ERDOGAN

00:30.997 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIALLY EXPANDED HIS

00:31.965 --> 00:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE POWERS IN A REFERENDUM

00:33.466 --> 00:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF

00:35.335 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR

00:39.739 --> 00:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EAST POLICY, HAS WRITTEN A NEW

00:40.874 --> 00:42.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOOK CALLED "THE NEW SULTAN:

00:45.311 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IN THIS ONE-YEAR PERIOD,

00:50.517 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO TURKEY?

00:52.152 --> 00:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> TURKEY HAS ACTUALLY NOT

00:53.219 --> 00:54.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC,

00:54.421 --> 00:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH THE COUP WAS PREVENTED,

00:58.124 --> 01:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAS BECOME MORE AUTHORITARIAN

01:00.760 --> 01:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LESS DEMOCRATIC, AND THAT IS

01:02.362 --> 01:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARILY BECAUSE INITIALLY

01:05.065 --> 01:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING AFTER COUP PLOTTERS,

01:06.699 --> 01:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN HAS THEN USED

01:08.968 --> 01:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POST-COUP POWERS, STATE OF

01:10.303 --> 01:12.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGENCY, GIVEN TO HIM TO GO

01:12.372 --> 01:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HIS OTHER OPPONENTS.

01:13.973 --> 01:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY IS AN EXTREMELY POLARIZED

01:15.608 --> 01:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE, WITH HALF OF THE COUNTRY

01:17.343 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADORING ERDOGAN, AND THE OTHER

01:19.379 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT

01:20.380 --> 01:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY LOATHES HIM.

01:21.514 --> 01:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ERDOGAN HAS TARGETED

01:22.949 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE IN THAT GROUP THAT

01:24.117 --> 01:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOATHES HIM.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES MEMBERS

01:26.753 --> 01:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE GULEN MOVEMENT, WHO

01:27.954 --> 01:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERDOGAN BELIEVES IS ALIGNED

01:29.556 --> 01:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE COUP EFFORT, BUT ALSO

01:31.891 --> 01:33.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBERALS, LEFTISTS AND KURDISH

01:33.259 --> 01:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONALISTS.

01:34.227 --> 01:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ERDOGAN WILL

01:34.894 --> 01:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, "LISTEN, I'M IN A... I'M

01:35.962 --> 01:36.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL... IN PARTS

01:38.898 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MY COUNTRY THAT WANT TO SPLIT

01:40.533 --> 01:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF AND BREAK OFF.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE HAD TERRORIST ATTACK

01:42.769 --> 01:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING ON MY OWN SOIL.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I NEED THIS POWER, I NEED IT

01:46.239 --> 01:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSOLIDATED."

01:47.273 --> 01:49.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S... THAT MESSAGE HAS

01:49.109 --> 01:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUNK IN WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.

01:51.010 --> 01:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT HAS.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE, ERDOGAN HAS A

01:52.745 --> 01:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIGHT SIDE, AS WELL-- THAT HE

01:53.880 --> 01:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DELIVERED ECONOMIC GROWTH,

01:55.248 --> 01:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS WHY THE CONSERVATIVES

01:56.916 --> 01:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BANDED AROUND HIM.

01:58.418 --> 01:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE ALSO HAS A DARK SIDE,

01:59.486 --> 02:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THAT HE HAS CRACKED

02:01.287 --> 02:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN ON OPPOSTION AND ERODED

02:03.690 --> 02:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC CHECKS AND BALANCES.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS, WHILE HALF OF

02:07.293 --> 02:08.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY LOVES HIM, THE OTHER

02:08.495 --> 02:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT

02:09.229 --> 02:10.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESPISES HIM WILL NEVER FOLD

02:10.730 --> 02:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER HIM.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE RISK FOR ERDOGAN IS THAT

02:13.233 --> 02:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KNOWS, AS I EXPLAINED IN "THE

02:15.168 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW SULTAN," HE KNOWS THAT HE

02:16.803 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT CONTINUE TO GOVERN TURKEY

02:18.338 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY HE LIKES SO LONG AS IT'S

02:19.806 --> 02:20.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS WHY IT LOOKS TO ME

02:21.875 --> 02:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO OTHER ANALYSTS THAT HE'S

02:23.042 --> 02:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING STEPS TO END DEMOCRACY IN

02:24.711 --> 02:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S JUST SAID THAT

02:26.546 --> 02:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PUT IN

02:27.914 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE AFTER THE COUP WILL BE

02:29.916 --> 02:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENDED INDEFINTELY UNTIL THERE

02:31.985 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PEACE AND WELFARE IN TURKEY.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU MEASURE PEACE AND

02:35.221 --> 02:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE?

02:36.122 --> 02:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT MEANS IT'S BASICALLY

02:37.223 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERMANENT.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR THE 40 MILLION TURKS WHO

02:39.492 --> 02:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSE HIM, THAT'S NOT

02:40.827 --> 02:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCEPTABLE.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, I FEAR THAT IF HE ENDS

02:43.096 --> 02:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRACY, THERE'S DEFINITELY A

02:44.731 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK FOR THAT HALF THAT OPPOSES

02:46.533 --> 02:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM WHO WILL NOW THINK THAT THEY

02:48.501 --> 02:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT VOTE HIM OUT.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF THEM,

02:51.137 --> 02:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE YOUTH ELEMENTS OF THEM,

02:52.238 --> 02:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT EVEN RADICALIZE.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, TURKEY'S POLARIZATION COULD

02:55.108 --> 02:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN GET WORSE AS A RESULT OF

02:56.709 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE POLICIES.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW MUCH OF

02:59.546 --> 03:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERDOGAN'S POSITION IS BOLSTERED

03:02.148 --> 03:05.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE CRUCIAL NATURE OF TURKEY

03:05.084 --> 03:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FIGHTING IN SYRIA OR IN

03:07.253 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S

03:09.355 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PRETTY HUGE ALLIES THAT ARE

03:11.758 --> 03:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTING ON TURKEY'S SUPPORT.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK ERDOGAN BASICALLY

03:14.427 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWS THAT THE UNITED STATES AND

03:16.496 --> 03:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATO ALLIES NEED TURKEY TO

03:18.231 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE TO FIGHT ISIS, AND HE

03:20.200 --> 03:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY GETS A HALL PASS IN

03:21.734 --> 03:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REGARD.

03:22.669 --> 03:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESPITE HIS DEMOCRATIC

03:23.870 --> 03:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSGRESSIONS, HE'S STILL

03:25.038 --> 03:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVITED TO SUMMITS AND

03:26.472 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEETINGS.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TURKEY

03:29.342 --> 03:31.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS POLARIZED

03:31.878 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENT, EVEN THOUGH ERDOGAN

03:33.246 --> 03:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT RECEIVE OPEN ARMS FROM

03:35.481 --> 03:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE DIGNITARIES, BECAUSE OF

03:37.750 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE

03:39.419 --> 03:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION GROUPS ARE VIOLENT

03:41.287 --> 03:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RADICAL AND, IN FACT,

03:42.322 --> 03:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS SUCH AS THE KURDISH

03:43.590 --> 03:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS, P.K.K.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEREFORE, GOING FORWARD,

03:46.159 --> 03:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GOING TO HAVE A VIOLENT

03:47.760 --> 03:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
