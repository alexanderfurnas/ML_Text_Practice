TWO THINGS I TAKE FROM THAT--
ONE, IT SHOWS THERE WAS A LOT OF
DETAIL PROVIDED TO CONGRESS IN

17:43.279 --> 17:45.692
ONE, IT SHOWS THERE WAS A LOT OF
DETAIL PROVIDED TO CONGRESS IN
2009 AND 2011, ABOUT THE

17:58.858 --> 18:00.313
CONGRESS HAD A SAYS WELL.

AND THE DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT

18:00.315 --> 18:02.132
