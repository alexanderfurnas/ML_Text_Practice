LIKELY TO BE AN IMPACT?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

02:32.185 --> 02:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE LOTS OF UNDECIDED

VOTERS WHO COULD HAVE BEEN

02:34.387 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCED BY THIS INFORMATION.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS A

02:37.790 --> 02:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUN-OFF.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TWO CANDIDATES THAT ARE IN

02:41.861 --> 02:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUN-OFF ATTRACT A TOTAL OF

02:43.596 --> 02:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND 45%, CERTAINLY UNDER 50%

02:46.933 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE TOTAL VOTE.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO

02:49.969 --> 02:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER SECOND CHOICES.

02:51.838 --> 02:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:56.242 --> 02:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE CHANGING THEIR MINDS LATE

02:57.977 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BEEN MORE SIGNS OF IT,

OF A REVAMPED BILL FROM THE

EMPLOYER MANDATE TO PROVIDE

MANDATE TO HAVE IT.

17:25.744 --> 17:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN PLAN WOULD

REPLACE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO

17:28.347 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUY HEALTH INSURANCE WITH TAX

CREDITS.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALLOW INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

IT'S HARD TO GET INTO TOO

18:02.981 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH OF A POLICY DISCUSSION,

18:04.383 --> 18:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS

18:05.551 --> 18:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO CHANGE IN SOME

18:06.518 --> 18:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT FORM BY THE TIME IT

18:08.153 --> 18:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETS TO THE SENATE, BUT LET'S

18:09.388 --> 18:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

18:10.556 --> 18:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICS OF THIS HERE.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THE RISKS FOR THE

18:13.592 --> 18:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS WHO DECIDED TO GET

18:15.427 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS THROUGH THE HOUSE?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YOU CAN SEE THE RISKS

18:18.230 --> 18:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO

18:21.300 --> 18:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THE POLITICAL TEMPERATURE,

18:23.001 --> 18:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE "COOK POLITICAL REPORT,"

18:24.503 --> 18:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A NON-PARTISAN SITE,

18:26.772 --> 18:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS JUST IN THE DAY OR TWO SINCE

18:29.274 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BILL PASSED MOVED 20 SEATS

18:31.610 --> 18:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE HOUSE TOWARD THE

18:32.811 --> 18:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT NON-PARTISAN, SAYS

18:39.184 --> 18:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NOW CONTEND TO CONTEST NOT

18:40.819 --> 18:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
45 OR 50 SEATS BUT WELL OVER

18:43.088 --> 18:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
100.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE THING I WOULD DEFINITELY

18:45.190 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP WATCHING IS WHETHER OR NOT

18:47.426 --> 18:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORMIDABLE DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS

18:49.995 --> 18:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREE TO CHALLENGE ENTRENCHED

18:51.830 --> 18:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS AS THE

18:54.199 --> 18:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MID-TERMS GET NEARER.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE A REAL SIGN THAT

18:57.169 --> 18:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS THINK THEY'VE GOT THE

18:58.704 --> 19:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS BECAUSE OF HEALTH

19:00.172 --> 19:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION.

19:02.141 --> 19:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAPPENS

19:02.975 --> 19:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE SENATE GOING FORWARD?

19:04.209 --> 19:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT KIND OF RESISTANCE WILL

19:05.043 --> 19:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE BE TO SOME OF THE

19:06.411 --> 19:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERPINNINGS IN THIS

19:08.147 --> 19:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATION NOW IN

19:10.015 --> 19:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LIKE THEY SAY IN THE

19:13.552 --> 19:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLPARK, WE CAN'T TELL THE

19:15.020 --> 19:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYERS WITHOUT A SCORECARD.

19:16.755 --> 19:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PASSED THE HOUSE BECAUSE

19:17.956 --> 19:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HARD RIGHT FREEDOM CAUCUS

19:20.359 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS,

19:21.894 --> 19:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH, IN TURN, REALLY WORRIED

19:23.862 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MODERATES, AND IN THE SENATE,

19:25.464 --> 19:27.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE ENOUGH MODERATE

19:27.099 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS TO DERAIL THIS.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE

19:30.235 --> 19:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ALREADY SAID TO THE HOUSE,

19:31.336 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE GOING TO WRITE OUR OWN

19:33.539 --> 19:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN ANSWER TO THIS, THE FACT

19:37.576 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IN MANY STATES REPUBLICAN

19:39.111 --> 19:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORS HAVE EXPANDED

19:40.579 --> 19:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID, AND PART OF THIS BILL,

19:43.182 --> 19:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST THE HOUSE VERSION,

19:44.316 --> 19:46.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT HOW MUCH IS

19:46.418 --> 19:49.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVAILABLE TO THESE STATES TO

19:49.188 --> 19:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP EXPANDING OR EVEN KEEP

19:50.722 --> 19:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID WHERE IT IS.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS

19:54.426 --> 19:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAY BE PUTTING PRESSURE ON

19:55.394 --> 19:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO FIX WHAT

19:57.963 --> 19:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOUSE DID.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A BYZANTINE PICTURE.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S TALK

20:02.100 --> 20:03.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT OBAMACARE.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF PEOPLE POINT OUT THAT

20:04.770 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS ALONG PARTY LINES.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT MOVE FOR

20:07.706 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES GOING TO BE

20:11.543 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMILAR IN THIS CASE?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION WHEN

20:15.714 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMACARE FINALLY GOT THROUGH --

20:17.683 --> 20:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SIGNED

20:18.817 --> 20:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BILL IN MARCH 2010 -- IT WAS

20:21.186 --> 20:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY UNPOPULAR.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BENEFITS DIDN'T BEGIN TO

20:24.590 --> 20:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KICK IN FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS,

20:26.191 --> 20:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BY THE TIME THE MID-TERMS

20:27.559 --> 20:30.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED IN 2010, THE

20:30.128 --> 20:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPOPULARITY OF THAT BILL, WHICH

20:32.030 --> 20:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT MITIGATED BY ANY

20:33.599 --> 20:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS BY THEN, PRODUCED A

20:36.335 --> 20:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
62-SEAT LOSS IN THE HOUSE FOR

20:38.237 --> 20:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMOCRATS.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU MEASURE PUBLIC OPINION

20:41.607 --> 20:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLS, TRUMPCARE, IF THAT'S WHAT

20:44.309 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT THE CALL THIS, IS EVEN

20:45.444 --> 20:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE UNPOPULAR NOW THAN

20:46.511 --> 20:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMACARE WAS THEN.

20:48.013 --> 20:48.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

20:48.647 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT

20:49.748 --> 20:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS OBAMACARE PASSED IN THE SAME

20:52.818 --> 20:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR AS AN ELECTION.

20:53.885 --> 20:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF TIME

20:54.886 --> 20:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER OF

20:56.989 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2018.

20:58.023 --> 20:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF
