JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return
to the battle over health care
and President Trump's meeting

00:04.300 --> 00:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Senate Republicans
at the White House.

00:07.166 --> 00:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hear from two people
who were in the room, first
Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.

00:12.133 --> 00:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a member of the
Health, Education, Labor
and Pensions Committee.

00:15.733 --> 00:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago and started by asking what
the president changed today

00:20.633 --> 00:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in his pitch to senators.

00:22.133 --> 00:24.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS (R), Kansas: We
had a meeting that I thought
was highly productive.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought the president made
a very good case that if you
simply have a repeal and, in two

00:33.133 --> 00:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, you're going to see
further deterioration, if that's
the right word, for Obamacare.

00:39.100 --> 00:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In Kansas, our premiums
continue to soar.

00:43.066 --> 00:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're up now $3,000.

00:45.166 --> 00:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a little like being in
the back seat of a convertible
with Thelma and Louise and

00:51.000 --> 00:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're headed toward the canyon.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're about at the edge.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we have got to do something.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Number one, we have
to get out of the car.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Number two, we have got
to get into a new car.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what the
president was talking about.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We had the entire
Republican Conference.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he did a good message.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was a good -- I
think he did a good job.

01:08.966 --> 01:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what
has changed with your
Republican colleagues?

01:12.466 --> 01:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, yesterday,
there weren't going to be
enough votes to do this.

01:15.866 --> 01:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Today, there are?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that simply because of an
argument the president made?

01:19.066 --> 01:21.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, the first
thing is, Judy, is that we have
got to get over this business

01:23.900 --> 01:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of denying the leadership of
our party, Mitch McConnell,
at least a motion to proceed.

01:30.266 --> 01:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the American people
want us to debate it.

01:32.300 --> 01:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the American
people want us to vote
on several different
items that people would

01:37.666 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be presenting.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a vote-a-rama anyway.

01:40.466 --> 01:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're probably going
to have 150 votes,.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need a debate
and we need to vote.

01:45.033 --> 01:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this business of
stopping the motion to
proceed, that has to quit.

01:48.866 --> 01:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that was one of the
main messages that the
president indicated,
to give Mitch McConnell

01:52.933 --> 01:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the -- obviously, the number
of votes he needed to go ahead
with this kind of an exercise.

01:59.066 --> 02:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the president
really listened.

02:01.366 --> 02:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had at least 35 people,
maybe 40, make suggestions
with regards to the bill.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a lot of consensus.

02:08.033 --> 02:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: And the other thing
-- and I think he mentioned
this is much larger than

02:12.733 --> 02:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care -- is whether or not
Republicans can actually govern.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying -- let me just clarify.

02:19.566 --> 02:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you're saying whether
Republicans can get together
as a group is more important

02:25.466 --> 02:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than health care legislation?

02:26.766 --> 02:28.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAT ROBERTS: No, it's
not more important.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's another consideration,
that, if we can't do this, maybe
you can't do tax reform or,

02:33.766 --> 02:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that matter, anything
else on the table.

02:36.333 --> 02:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Both are very important.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, you have to
get health care right.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was the whole
intent of the meeting.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He listened very carefully.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He stated his position
very forcefully.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it was
a good meeting.

02:48.066 --> 02:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
ask you about the fact that the
criticisms of this legislation

02:52.533 --> 02:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are the same today as
they were yesterday.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just looking
at the state of Kansas.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your hospital association had
-- had looked at the changes
you had proposed directing

03:02.833 --> 03:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more money to the hospitals.

03:04.866 --> 03:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said, that's great,
but they said, even with that,
it doesn't make up for the

03:08.366 --> 03:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep cuts to Medicaid and
other problems with the bill.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you say today to
your hospital association?

03:14.033 --> 03:16.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, as a matter
of fact, I'm meeting with them
just as I get through talking

03:17.566 --> 03:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I will point out to
them that Obamacare will
continue to deteriorate.

03:25.566 --> 03:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have already lost
one insurance company;
42,000 Kansans don't
have insurance anymore.

03:30.833 --> 03:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we lose our remaining
insurer, we're really
going to be in trouble.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it isn't so much what we
would like to have as what
is happening to Obamacare.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, working with the
Kansas Hospital Association,
I think there are going
to be some new ideas

03:47.000 --> 03:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presented in whatever
bill that comes up with
- - or we come up with.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the president was
doing a lot of listening.

03:51.666 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House was doing a lot
of listening, Tom Price, Seema
Verma, all the people within

03:58.300 --> 04:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the administration, that
they're going to come
up with something new.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I also
was reading that 70 percent
of all Medicaid enrollees

04:03.966 --> 04:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the state of
Kansas are children.

04:05.633 --> 04:06.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAT ROBERTS: Right.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Three hundred
thousand Kansas children.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's going to happen to them?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:12.033 --> 04:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, they're
going to be covered.

04:13.266 --> 04:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are increasing
Medicaid every year.

04:15.966 --> 04:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be some more
wrap-around amendments or
different opportunities
for Medicaid for

04:19.966 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we were a
non-Medicaid state.

04:23.166 --> 04:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the reasons the
Kansas Hospital Association
was so upset with this is that,

04:29.033 --> 04:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
twice, they really supported
efforts on Medicaid funding, and
not to make it a non-Medicaid

04:36.933 --> 04:38.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expansion state.

04:38.666 --> 04:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that ship has sailed.

04:41.033 --> 04:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kansas state legislature
didn't approve that, and
the governor vetoed it.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were not able
to override the veto.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to work
with what we have.

04:49.900 --> 04:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to be in my
office in about 30 minutes, and
we are going to go over that

04:53.200 --> 04:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what the president said.

04:55.266 --> 04:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we look
forward to hearing about
the outcome of that meeting.

04:58.033 --> 05:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Pat Roberts of
Kansas, thank you very much.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:01.233 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: My privilege.

05:02.233 --> 05:02.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.
