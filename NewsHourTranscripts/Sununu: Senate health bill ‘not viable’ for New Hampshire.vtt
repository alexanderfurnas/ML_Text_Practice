JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, let's
turn to the Senate Republican
bill to overhaul parts of

00:05.233 --> 00:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

00:07.266 --> 00:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate may be in recess
this week, but Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell is working

00:10.966 --> 00:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind the scenes to craft a
bill that will appeal to enough
Republican votes to pass.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the key stumbling blocks,
the provision to cut Medicaid
spending by more than $770

00:23.366 --> 00:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
billion over 10 years.

00:25.833 --> 00:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has sparked serious
concern among many governors,
among other reasons, over what

00:32.400 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it could mean for opioid
abuse treatment and
related health needs.

00:35.433 --> 00:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Medicaid expansion under
the Affordable Care Act
provided new coverage to many.

00:42.733 --> 00:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reportedly, Senator McConnell
has been considering
a $45 billion fund to
deal with opioid abuse.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Hampshire is one state
that is dealing with a crisis.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has the second highest
rate of opioid deaths
relative to its population.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with the state's
Republican governor, Christopher
Sununu, a short time ago, and

01:00.300 --> 01:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started by asking him why he
doesn't support the current
Republican Senate proposal.

01:04.433 --> 01:06.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU (R), New Hampshire:
Well, I think it's important
to start off by understanding

01:08.466 --> 01:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Obamacare has failed,
it is not sustainable,
it is not affordable.

01:13.033 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Specifically here in New
Hampshire, the health care
exchange is really on the brink.

01:16.033 --> 01:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at upwards
of 40 percent cost
increases to individuals.

01:19.966 --> 01:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's just not
affordable to anyone.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I do applaud the Senate
and the House's efforts and the
Trump administration's efforts

01:25.733 --> 01:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to really take Obamacare as
a reform that has to happen.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That being said, what they're
really doing here is, they're
kind of conflating two issues.

01:34.866 --> 01:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're looking at Medicaid,
traditional Medicaid entitlement
reform, which absolutely has to

01:39.233 --> 01:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a viable discussion in
Congress, and Obamacare reform.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're really
putting the two together.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the end result there.

01:46.666 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cost implications, if you
will, are really drastic to
the state of New Hampshire.

01:50.733 --> 01:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You're looking at over
$1.5 billion at best
over the next 10 years.

01:54.366 --> 01:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not just a challenge
for us in the state.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not practical.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just not practical at all.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have no sales tax,
we have no income tax.

02:01.033 --> 02:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have the taxes to
raise, nor would we ever want
to, like other states do.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have to find a
better solution there.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I commend them for
taking up the challenge.

02:10.433 --> 02:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But right now, as it sits, the
Senate plan is not a viable
solution for this state.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Governor,
specifically with regard to
the opioid use crisis in your

02:21.400 --> 02:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state of New Hampshire,
what would this bill, this
proposal mean for that?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:26.433 --> 02:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, we have been
on kind of ground zero, if you
will, for the opioid crisis.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have one of the fastest
growing economies, one of
the best qualities of life.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we are a small state,
that allows us to be very
innovative in our approach.

02:37.766 --> 02:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we have been able to
sustain great success in the
state, in spite of the opioid

02:42.033 --> 02:43.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

02:43.966 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But part of that, when you
look whether it's Medicaid
expansion or other programs that

02:46.533 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have allowed individuals to
get care, recovery services,
medical care that they otherwise

02:53.533 --> 02:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not have -- would have been
able to receive, that has been
a big boon for our state and

02:56.200 --> 03:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been a big boost to those
individuals and allowed those
doors to be opened to them

03:00.566 --> 03:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in ways that otherwise
it wouldn't have.

03:03.166 --> 03:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you look at both
the cost implications,
how Medicaid expansion
right now as it's proposed

03:07.200 --> 03:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to being winnowed down, if
you will, over the next few
years, again, those costs are

03:11.800 --> 03:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real severe and they're again
something that just is not
practical for the state of New

03:16.200 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

03:18.733 --> 03:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would
it mean to the program
that you have in place
now in New Hampshire?

03:20.066 --> 03:22.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, when you
look at folks that are coming
through recovery or treatment

03:24.733 --> 03:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or folks that are looking
to fight that addiction,
you have remember
addiction with opioids is

03:27.733 --> 03:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not something that you get
through in a couple of years.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a lifelong struggle.

03:31.833 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a lifelong kind of battle,
if you will, that folks have
to have the programs in place

03:37.533 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just for six months or a
year, but for the long-term.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to have
those recovery programs.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to have those
treatment options in place.

03:43.566 --> 03:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With opioid addiction
comes some very severe
medical conditions as
well, whether liver

03:49.700 --> 03:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or heart issues
that come with that.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Right now, we're
able to treat those.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're able to be preventative
with a lot of those, as opposed
to just allowing the old

03:56.933 --> 04:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of doing things where
everyone would just pile
into the emergency room.

04:00.100 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, going back, taking instead
of one or two steps back,
but three or four steps back,

04:07.066 --> 04:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the way to the point where
we're cutting services that,
pre-Obamacare, were in place,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, we're looking for a
system that, for New Hampshire
at least, is worse than there

04:14.833 --> 04:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were even pre-Obamacare.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So my message to the
Senate is very clear.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at Obamacare reform as is.

04:21.900 --> 04:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at that program, what
we can do to reform it.

04:25.066 --> 04:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Understand that the opioid
crisis is affecting a lot of
states, not just New Hampshire.

04:29.033 --> 04:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Understand what those
implications might be.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just in the funding,
but it's in the flexibilities
that states have to have.

04:34.366 --> 04:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

04:35.366 --> 04:36.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:36.866 --> 04:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: You have to
have a flexible system.

04:38.866 --> 04:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And being able to do that
will allow us as governors to
implement the programs that much

04:41.000 --> 04:43.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easier.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, it's
been reported, as I think you
know, that the Senate majority

04:45.433 --> 04:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leader, Mitch McConnell,
is looking at possibly
adding something like
$45 billion to deal

04:51.933 --> 04:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with opioid abuse around the
country over a period of years.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would that make a difference?

04:57.466 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: When you look
at $45 billion to deal with
the opioid crisis, absolutely

05:02.533 --> 05:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's going to
make a difference.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about it.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's money going in to kind
of hopefully get votes in the
Senate bill, that's a different

05:09.966 --> 05:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

05:10.966 --> 05:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not going to sign onto that.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But there is no doubt
that more resources
would help this crisis.

05:14.900 --> 05:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows recovery centers to
have more longer-term programs,
open up treatment options.

05:19.266 --> 05:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can break down some
of the permitting process
to get more of those beds
open for individuals,

05:23.566 --> 05:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peer-to-peer recovery services.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been able to be very,
very innovative here in New
Hampshire, really on the cutting

05:29.700 --> 05:31.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
edge.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's how we have been
able to sustain such a growing
economy, such a high quality

05:34.166 --> 05:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of life, in spite of the crisis.

05:36.266 --> 05:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want to start throwing
a wrench in those gears right
now and slow down the incredible

05:40.533 --> 05:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process we have been able
to make in New Hampshire.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask you about
that money because specifically
other governors, I know

05:45.733 --> 05:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kasich of Ohio and others
who have an opioid crisis in
their own states, have said

05:52.700 --> 05:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's just not enough money
to make a difference over
a long number of years.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

05:57.266 --> 06:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, as I said
earlier, you know, this is
something that is not going

06:00.166 --> 06:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get solved in the
next couple of years.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is going to be a lifetime
issue for a lot of these folks.

06:04.200 --> 06:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to have lifetime-style
programs in place to kind
of ease them not just off of

06:09.033 --> 06:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opioids they're in,
making sure they have
peer-to-peer support
recovery programs, making

06:12.933 --> 06:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sure they can enter the
work force and hopefully
get on better private
insurance plans, as

06:17.300 --> 06:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposed to just relying
on expanded Medicaid or
the health care exchange.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when you're able to create
systems that work efficiently
-- I'm an engineer by trade.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm all about creating
an efficient system.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're able to do that
and implement that, there is
a lot of savings you can have

06:31.200 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the back end.

06:32.466 --> 06:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do believe dollars can help.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about that.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you look at the total
implication of this Senate
bill, $1.5 billion at best

06:40.400 --> 06:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next 10 years, I don't
mean to sound glib, but $45
billion here and there really

06:47.366 --> 06:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't making the dent and really
making the long-term effects
that we have to be addressing

06:50.933 --> 06:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as part of a long-term
Medicaid reform.

06:53.066 --> 06:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor, one
other thing, the argument that
the Republicans in Congress

06:57.433 --> 07:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made on Medicaid and
that is -- and the president's
budget director, Mick Mulvaney,

07:04.266 --> 07:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has said Medicaid is
unsustainable on the path that
it's on now, it's grown way too

07:09.933 --> 07:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expensive, it cannot continue
like this, cuts have to come,
there has to be a change in

07:14.200 --> 07:15.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the trajectory.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well,
look, I would absolutely
agree with that.

07:18.966 --> 07:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, Washington is dealing
-- the Senate and the House
and the president are dealing

07:22.033 --> 07:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with nearly $20
trillion in debt.

07:25.033 --> 07:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is real money
owed to someone, and
a lot of it oversees.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, our spending over the
last eight years has gone
completely out of control.

07:33.100 --> 07:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they do have
the challenge ahead of
them of reeling that
spending back in, creating

07:37.066 --> 07:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more efficient systems.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reeling it in is one thing.

07:41.466 --> 07:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Going above and beyond from
even where we were eight
years ago is another story.

07:44.633 --> 07:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where we kind of
draw the line and say, look,
let's deal with Obamacare here,

07:49.166 --> 07:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's deal with Medicaid
entitlement reform in another
discussion, another discussion

07:53.766 --> 07:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that frankly has to probably
be a longer discussion,
have to really get the
input from the states,

07:58.133 --> 08:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing that should be rushed.

08:00.633 --> 08:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if we can deal with
those two issues separately,
I think we can have just
much better outcomes

08:03.366 --> 08:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a much more viable
solution for all the states.

08:06.666 --> 08:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Chris
Sununu of New Hampshire, thank
you very much for talking

08:10.100 --> 08:11.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

08:12.100 --> 08:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Thank you, Judy.
