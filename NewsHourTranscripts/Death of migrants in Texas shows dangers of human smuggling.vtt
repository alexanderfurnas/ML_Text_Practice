JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest on
a human smuggling case in Texas
that has left at least 10 people

00:07.400 --> 00:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dead after they were packed into
a sweltering tractor-trailer.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And again to John Yang.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The truck
driver, James Bradley,
was charged in federal
court today with knowingly

00:17.966 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transporting people who are in
the country illegally for money.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the criminal
complaint, a Wal-Mart
employee called police
early Sunday to report

00:25.733 --> 00:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the suspicious tractor-trailer
in the parking lot after
someone asked for water.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Officers found dozens
of people packed into
the sweltering trailer.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In addition to the
dead, nearly 20 others
are still hospitalized.

00:39.866 --> 00:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bradley told police he was
driving the tractor-trailer
from Iowa to a new owner
in Brownsville, Texas,

00:46.933 --> 00:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and wasn't aware of what or who
he was hauling until he stopped
at the Wal-Mart for a bathroom

00:52.100 --> 00:54.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
break.

00:54.233 --> 00:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Survivors said there was no
air conditioning and described
taking turns to breath through

00:57.700 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hole in the trailer.

00:59.933 --> 01:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason Buch is covering the
story and reports on border and
immigration issues for The San

01:04.033 --> 01:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Antonio Express-News.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jason, thanks for joining us.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First, bring us up to date.

01:09.733 --> 01:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the latest today and
what did we learn from the truck
driver's appearance in court?

01:15.933 --> 01:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH, The San Antonio
Express-News: Well, there
wasn't a whole lot said in court

01:16.866 --> 01:18.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this morning.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going to be held until
a bond hearing on Thursday.

01:20.866 --> 01:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. Attorney's Office
signed off on a complaint
by immigration agents that

01:29.033 --> 01:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
detailed what they learned in
their interviews with the driver
and with the immigrants, and,

01:33.766 --> 01:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you described, this journey
up from the border in an
overheated container with a very

01:40.833 --> 01:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
limited ability to
get air from one hole.

01:43.033 --> 01:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talk about
the charges he's facing.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're federal charges.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the maximum penalty?

01:48.666 --> 01:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH: So, most smuggling
charges come with a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because people died
in this case, he actually
faces up to life in prison
or the death penalty.

02:01.300 --> 02:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had another incident here
about 15 years ago in which
several people died, 19 people

02:07.366 --> 02:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
died after being
abandoned in a trailer.

02:09.366 --> 02:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death penalty was
overturned in that case, and
that driver got 34 years.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it would be difficult for
the U.S. Attorney's Office to
prove up a capital case here.

02:17.433 --> 02:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How widespread are
these smuggling operations?

02:21.133 --> 02:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can you tell us about them?

02:23.200 --> 02:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON BUCH: I mean, people
come across the border
in South Texas every day.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Border Patrol in Laredo,
which is where these folks
crossed, have reported in the

02:31.900 --> 02:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last couple months an uptick in
people using tractor-trailers
to try to get through the

02:38.333 --> 02:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Border Patrol checkpoint and
reach the cities to the north.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a long time
since we have had a
fatal incident like this
involving a tractor-trailer,

02:46.733 --> 02:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but certainly there have been
a number of incidents reported
by Border Patrol recently

02:50.933 --> 02:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of dozens of people packed
into tractor-trailers.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And tell us
how these operations work.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, these people, some
of the survivors said they
crossed the river actually on a

02:59.133 --> 03:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
raft and then they were
being taken farther
north in this truck?

03:03.900 --> 03:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they work in general?

03:04.933 --> 03:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Right.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what they described was
being -- paying a smuggler in
Mexico to bring them across

03:09.800 --> 03:11.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the border.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were then brought
to most likely stash
houses on the U.S. side.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when it was time to
load the truck, it appears that
people who were being smuggled

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by different groups were
all brought to where
this trailer was parked,
loaded into the trailer,

03:25.433 --> 03:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then driven to Laredo.

03:27.533 --> 03:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in fact, they were
given -- each group
was given a different
color tape to determine

03:33.066 --> 03:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who they should go with when
they arrived in San Antonio.

03:36.433 --> 03:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the immigrants
described to investigators
that there were black
SUVs waiting for them

03:42.633 --> 03:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the Wal-Mart parking
lot when they pulled up.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And where they
would be taken after that?

03:46.366 --> 03:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where would these
SUVs take them?

03:48.633 --> 03:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Some people
said that they were
staying in San Antonio.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Others -- another person
interviewed by the
immigration agents said
that they were headed

03:56.866 --> 03:58.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Minnesota.

03:58.966 --> 04:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, San Antonio is a
pass-through because we're on
a major highway to the border.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People are usually going
on to major metropolitan
areas or regions of
the country that employ

04:08.033 --> 04:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of immigrant laborers,
so, areas with large agriculture
industries or construction

04:14.700 --> 04:16.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
booms.

04:16.666 --> 04:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And obviously,
business -- I'm sorry -- border
security, immigration issues

04:20.300 --> 04:25.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are a big topic, with
President Trump talking
about the border wall.

04:26.833 --> 04:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Has this incident
gotten swept up in the
politics of this issue?

04:30.566 --> 04:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Absolutely.

04:32.833 --> 04:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our lieutenant governor was
on Facebook yesterday blaming
this on sanctuary cities.

04:39.733 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our legislature recently passed
a bill that would provide
criminal penalties and fines

04:45.766 --> 04:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for officials who ran what
they call sanctuary cities.

04:52.133 --> 04:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the lieutenant governor was
placing blame for this incident
on cities and counties that

04:57.766 --> 04:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't cooperate with federal
immigration officials.

04:59.700 --> 05:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it's a
horrible, horrible incident,
reminds us of the people behind

05:04.033 --> 05:05.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these issues.

05:05.266 --> 05:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jason Buch, thanks so
much for joining us.

05:06.433 --> 05:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON BUCH: Thank you.
