JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for
more on the special counsel's
investigation into the president

00:04.033 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for possible obstruction
of justice, we are
joined by Carrie Johnson.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's the justice
correspondent for NPR.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carrie, welcome
back to the program.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR:
Happy to be here.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: First of
all, define for us, what
is obstruction of justice?

00:16.933 --> 00:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: There's
a bunch of obstruction
of justice statutes on
the books, Judy, but,

00:21.033 --> 00:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in plain language, it
means trying to interfere
with or impede an official
proceeding, something

00:25.833 --> 00:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a grand jury investigation,
a congressional investigation.

00:29.900 --> 00:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And prosecutors would have
to prove some kind of bad
intent by the person involved.

00:34.233 --> 00:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so tell us
what you have been able to learn
about how the special counsel

00:40.433 --> 00:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is looking into this.

00:42.566 --> 00:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, we know it's
been reported that they're also
looking into potential financial

00:45.566 --> 00:47.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
misdeeds.

00:47.733 --> 00:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Yes, the special
counsel investigation appears to
be running on three tracks now,

00:51.566 --> 00:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one probing any Russian
interference in the
election, two, probing
any financial misdealings

00:59.166 --> 01:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in connection with that
interference by associates
of the Trump campaign
and Russians, and, three,

01:03.933 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probing obstruction of justice
by the president himself in
the firing of James Comey, the

01:09.833 --> 01:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI director he ousted last
month because, he later said,
to take some pressure off the

01:12.900 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russia thing.

01:14.966 --> 01:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is
clearly, Carrie, an expansion
of what it was originally said

01:20.033 --> 01:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the special counsel's
mission was here.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: I think
it's another layer.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We knew at the time
that the deputy attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein,
appointed Bob Mueller

01:27.233 --> 01:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special counsel that his mandate
included crimes that arose or
may have arisen in connection

01:33.233 --> 01:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the investigation.

01:35.266 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of course, obstruction
of justice may have
arisen in connection
with this investigation

01:39.466 --> 01:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the president and his
leaning on Comey allegedly to
go light on Michael Flynn, the

01:44.100 --> 01:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
national security adviser.

01:46.133 --> 01:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have also
been hearing in the last few
days, Carrie, about some of the

01:50.233 --> 01:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professionals that the special
counsel, Bob Mueller, has
hired, brought on board for his

01:55.733 --> 01:56.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

01:56.566 --> 01:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about them.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: It's a
breathtaking array of
prosecutorial talent,
Judy, from a man

02:01.433 --> 02:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had experience prosecuting
the Watergate scandal, a former
FBI agent, Andrew Weissmann,

02:06.366 --> 02:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who led the Justice Department's
fraud and money-laundering
section, Jeannie Rhee, who

02:13.833 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been a top lawyer in
the Obama administration's
DOJ, finally, Michael
Dreeben, the deputy

02:18.400 --> 02:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solicitor general, the man
many lawyers in Justice think
is the most respected guy in

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the whole department.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
that tell you about what Mr.
Mueller and they will be -- and

02:28.366 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his team will be looking for?

02:30.366 --> 02:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Well, it signals
that special counsel Mueller
knows there are a number of

02:36.800 --> 02:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thorny legal issues involved
here, everything from financial
dealings and tracking the money,

02:42.466 --> 02:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to complicated questions of
executive privilege with respect
to the president, his aides,

02:45.433 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conversations he might
have had with people outside
the government as well.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Michael Dreeben, the
deputy solicitor general, is
well-known for making criminal

02:53.900 --> 02:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convictions stick
in appeals courts.

02:55.933 --> 02:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they're settling in
for the long haul here.

02:58.366 --> 03:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it
your understanding,
from what you have been
able to learn, that Mr.

03:03.133 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mueller is now finished, that
the team is done, or that
he's continuing to hire, bring

03:06.866 --> 03:08.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people on?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: They have
not given us a formal update.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's not yet submitted
a formal budget to the
Justice Department.

03:12.266 --> 03:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm hearing from sources
in and outside the government
that more people are clamoring

03:16.666 --> 03:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to join this team.

03:18.133 --> 03:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They view it as a
major public service.

03:20.666 --> 03:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And working with Bob
Mueller, who had been
the FBI director for 12
years, with his reputation

03:25.000 --> 03:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for integrity, is something
that a lot of people inside the
government want to do still.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
what are you hearing about
how long this could go on?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How long is it going to take?

03:33.533 --> 03:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: There is no
prediction at this point.

03:35.466 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, all these
investigators could dig and
dig and dig and find nothing.

03:39.466 --> 03:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of that time, they
may want to do a report that
becomes public, or they may

03:44.166 --> 03:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find something they want to
charge with a grand jury.

03:47.433 --> 03:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's unpredictable right
now who they might charge,
if anyone, and whether that

03:52.133 --> 03:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person might want to
fight it out in court for
months or years to come.

03:55.766 --> 04:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, Judy, with respect
to the president himself, no
evidence yet he will face any

04:00.233 --> 04:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges whatsoever, but there
is a complicated legal question
of whether you can actually

04:04.233 --> 04:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indict a sitting president of
the United States or turn that
evidence over to Congress for

04:09.033 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible impeachment.

04:10.366 --> 04:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
complicated legal question.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can assume some
folks are looking into that.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: I think a lot
of folks are looking into that.

04:17.933 --> 04:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It arose during Watergate,
of course, and was
never fully answered.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We may yet get an answer in this
investigation before it's over.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie
Johnson of NPR, we thank you.

04:27.633 --> 04:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Thank you.
