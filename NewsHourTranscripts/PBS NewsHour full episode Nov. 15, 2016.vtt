at what's
behind the surge in hate crimes

I saw absolutely
extraordinary events, have
changed my view

00:38.038 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on myself, have changed my view
on humanity
entirely.

00:41.742 --> 00:47.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we gather
some of the
tremendous outpouring
remembering Gwen Ifill.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's

HARI SREENIVASAN:

spent another day huddling with
advisers on

01:06.033 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Another adviser dismissed
concerns that Mr.
Trump is staying out of sight.

01:14.741 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I think he's -- you know,
he's making
phone calls to leaders and
they're calling

01:19.413 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's having people come in.

01:22.115 --> 01:26.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're probably in the best
place to be
here and watch who's coming and
going.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's just talking as it's
appropriate.

01:27.988 --> 01:32.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The

popular vote

01:32.526 --> 01:34.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Hillary Clinton.

01:34.294 --> 01:37.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted: "If the election
were based on
total popular vote, I would have
campaigned

01:37.831 --> 01:43.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in New York, Florida and
California and won
even bigger and more easily."

01:43.136 --> 01:48.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama urged world

BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We are going to have to guard
against a rise

02:01.288 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a crude sort of nationalism,
or ethnic
identity, or tribalism that is
built around

02:11.331 --> 02:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an us and a them.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
also defended
his own economic record, saying
the country's

02:16.803 --> 02:19.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
indisputably better off.

02:19.139 --> 02:23.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France and the U.N. today
stepped up appeals
to president-elect Trump not to
quit a global

02:23.810 --> 02:25.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
accord on climate change.

out of the Paris agreement would
be disastrous

02:30.183 --> 02:31.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for future generations.

02:31.918 --> 02:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-Moon
agreed, but said
he's sure the incoming president
will make

02:38.225 --> 02:40.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a good and wise decision.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan has won
the unanimous
support of his fellow
Republicans to stay

02:45.032 --> 02:46.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the job.

02:46.733 --> 02:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their vote today clears the way
for the full
House to make it official come
January.

02:50.604 --> 02:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before today's vote, Ryan said
he's ready
and eager, with Republicans
controlling both

02:54.474 --> 02:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress and the White House
starting next
year.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:58.912 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: Welcome
to the dawn of a new unified
Republican government.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It feels really good to say
that, actually.

03:05.619 --> 03:09.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will be a government
focused on turning
president-elect Trump's victory
into real

03:09.790 --> 03:11.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
progress for the American
people.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our team is very excited and we
cannot wait
to get to work.

03:14.795 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Democrats delayed
their leadership contest for
another two weeks,

03:19.299 --> 03:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amid dissatisfaction over the
election results.

03:22.069 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unclear if Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi
will face a serious challenge,
but more than

03:26.273 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two dozen Democrats asked to
delay the vote.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Syria, a three-week break in
airstrikes
on Aleppo is over.

03:34.147 --> 03:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian planes blasted rebels in
the city today,
and Russia launched a new air
offensive elsewhere.

03:39.286 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian jets from an aircraft
carrier and
long-range missiles hit targets
in two provinces.

03:45.258 --> 03:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moscow says they targeted
Islamic State militants
and others.

03:49.096 --> 03:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department is playing
down findings
that American troops and the CIA
may be guilty

03:54.801 --> 03:56.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of war crimes in Afghanistan.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report comes from the
International Criminal
Court.

03:59.573 --> 04:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, the chief prosecutor says
the detainees
were subject to torture, cruel
treatment,

04:04.044 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and outrages upon personal
dignity between
2003 and 2014.

04:08.715 --> 04:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. is not part of the
court, but any
American who's indicted could
still face prosecution.

04:15.322 --> 04:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Germany carried out
raids today
on nearly 200 apartments,
offices and mosques

04:20.560 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tied to a newly banned Islamist
group.

04:23.330 --> 04:27.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allegedly recruited youths to
fight in
Iraq and Syria.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officers collected troves of
documents, hard
drives and weapons as evidence.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The raids took place in more
than 60 cities.

04:35.876 --> 04:40.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that Chinese
software in some
Android phones automatically
sends data back

04:40.947 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a server in China.

04:42.816 --> 04:48.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports the
software monitors
locations, call logs and text
messages.

04:48.321 --> 04:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International customers and
users of disposable
or prepaid phones are most
affected.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The data collection could be for
advertising
usage or intelligence.

04:57.697 --> 05:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, energy
stocks led the
market higher as oil prices
surged 6 percent,

05:02.802 --> 05:05.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amid talk that OPEC will cut
output.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 54
points to close at 18923.

05:09.075 --> 05:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 57 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 16.

05:14.614 --> 05:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what the
president-elect's staff picks
tell us about

05:18.919 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his policies; recent tensions in
race relations
and what they may portend for
the future;

05:24.524 --> 05:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a psychotherapist's struggle
with his own
trauma one year after the Paris
attacks; and

05:30.263 --> 05:41.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

05:41.908 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we turn to president-elect
Trump's transition
to the White House and how his
team is tackling

05:46.880 --> 05:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the handover of executive reins.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we are joined by Alex
Isenstadt
of Politico.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Alex, you're reporting on
this every today.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do things stand right now?

05:55.121 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT, Politico: Well,
look, it's
a transition that's very much in
flux.

05:58.391 --> 06:04.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're starting to see a
pattern here
of a Donald Trump sort of
overseeing a process

06:04.331 --> 06:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that very much was sort of like
his campaign.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a little bit of chaos
involved.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're sort of starting to see
some of that
chaos seep into the transition a
little bit.

06:12.672 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And perhaps this is a little --
perhaps this
provides an indication of what
Donald Trump's

06:16.977 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
management and leadership style
is going to
be like once he gets to the
White House.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Chris
Christie was demoted
last week.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mike Pence replaced him.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's overarching the kind of
lead on this.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's been some internal
strife.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hear Mike Rogers stepped
down.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was behind that?

06:32.359 --> 06:36.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, look, Mike
Rogers, former
congressman from Michigan, used
to head the

06:36.229 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intel Committee in Congress, he
was very close
to Chris Christie, who last week
was pushed

06:41.101 --> 06:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aside in a leadership shuffle,
where they
put vice president-elect Mike
Pence in charge.

06:46.806 --> 06:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is something that
you also saw
during the campaign where Donald
Trump went

06:51.111 --> 06:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through several different
campaign managers.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now going through a few
different transition
heads.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, you're starting to see
sort of a pattern
emerge here.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the grand
scheme of things,
does it matter?

07:01.154 --> 07:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I probably couldn't tell you who
managed the
transition for the last three,
four, ever

07:05.792 --> 07:06.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidents?

07:06.793 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, it's a
great question.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, to some extent, this is
inside baseball.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's parlor game stuff.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to some degree, it does
indicate perhaps
something about Donald Trump's
leadership

07:14.834 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style, how he oversees things,
and exactly
how he's going to make some
decisions.

07:19.372 --> 07:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes at a time when a lot
of Americans
are looking for more information
on how Donald

07:23.410 --> 07:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump is going to lead and how
he makes key
decisions.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there also
seems to
be this tension.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What he wanted on the campaign
was -- he ran
as an outsider.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wanted people from outside
Washington.

07:32.886 --> 07:37.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yet, right now, when you
actually have lots
and lots of jobs to fill, he's
calling on

07:37.557 --> 07:38.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some insiders.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: Absolutely.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look at the names that you're
hearing talked
of for top jobs, people like
Rudy Giuliani,

07:43.963 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people like Jeff Sessions, the
Alabama senator.

07:46.299 --> 07:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people are -- to some
degree, they're
insiders, but they also share a
similar trait,

07:51.771 --> 07:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is that they were all
loyal to him during
the campaign, at a time, during
a campaign,

07:56.209 --> 08:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when a lot of Republicans sought
to distance
themselves from Donald Trump.

08:00.547 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's priding loyalty and he's
looking to those
who were loyal to him during the
campaign,

08:05.385 --> 08:07.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who stood behind him.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He's also now
getting the
intelligence briefings on a
daily basis that

08:10.223 --> 08:11.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Obama gets.

08:11.791 --> 08:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How is that influencing some of
the decisions
that he has in front of him now?

08:15.628 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: It's unclear.

08:17.397 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also unclear exactly
how this is
shaping who is going to be
getting some of

08:22.502 --> 08:24.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these top posts.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was some reporting over
the last day
or so that Trump wanted
clearance for his

08:27.207 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children and for his son-in-law,
Jared Kushner,
to also be getting these
security clearances.

08:32.479 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The campaign -- or the
transition committee,
rather, pushed back a little bit
on that reporting.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, it's clear that this
is a guy who
is new to government.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's new to this kind of thing,
and he's now
for the first time getting this
information.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are transition
teams the
place where you start to reward
your friends

08:47.961 --> 08:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been loyal to you for
so long and
eventually maybe in government
positions as

08:52.332 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, look, you
look back
at George W. Bush's
administration, he selected

08:56.970 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who were very close to
his family,
to his father, and so you do see
some of that

09:03.410 --> 09:05.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's interesting.

09:05.178 --> 09:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at the people who
Donald Trump is
looking at, even people who he
has already

09:09.215 --> 09:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
selected, Reince Priebus,
Stephen Bannon.

09:11.151 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are people who really
played key roles
in his campaign and now are
going to be overseeing

09:15.388 --> 09:16.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his White House.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alex Isenstadt
of Politico, thanks so much.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALEX ISENSTADT: Thank you.

09:19.459 --> 09:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just this past
weekend,
president-elect Trump announced
his picks

09:23.096 --> 09:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for two key posts in the White
House.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will
serve as
White House chief of staff.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Stephen Bannon, executive
chairman of
Breitbart News, will serve as
Mr. Trump's

09:32.806 --> 09:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief strategist and senior
counselor.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our John Yang has more.

09:37.310 --> 09:42.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For more on these two
men tapped
to advise the president, we're
joined by Mark

09:42.215 --> 09:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leibovich, chief national
correspondent for
"The New York Times" magazine,
and Joshua

09:46.619 --> 09:49.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Green, senior national
correspondent for Bloomberg
Businessweek.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh, Mark, thanks for joining
us.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Josh, let me start with you.

09:53.460 --> 09:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You profiled Steve Bannon more
than a year
ago, before a lot of people
realized who he

09:58.798 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the employment that's
gaining a lot
of controversy.

10:02.702 --> 10:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just this afternoon, Senator
Harry Reid, the
Democratic leader in the Senate,
took to the

10:07.807 --> 10:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate floor and criticized
Bannon in pretty
harsh terms.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: If Trump
is serious about seeking unity,
the first

10:14.447 --> 10:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing he should do is rescind
his appointment
of Steve Bannon.

10:17.984 --> 10:18.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rescind it.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't do it.

10:20.086 --> 10:23.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Think about this.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't do it.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as a champion of racial
division is
a step away from the Oval
Office, it will

10:28.995 --> 10:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be impossible to take Trump's
efforts to heal
the nation seriously.

10:32.899 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Josh, who is Steve
Bannon, and
why is he attracting all this
criticism?

10:37.770 --> 10:41.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN, Bloomberg
Businessweek: Well,
Bannon is an odd and interesting
character.

10:41.207 --> 10:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former Goldman Sachs
banker who sort
of became radicalized into the
Tea Party movement

10:47.280 --> 10:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eventually wound up as the
publisher of
Breitbart News, which is the
hard-right populist

10:52.719 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Web site that was an early
champion of Trump's.

10:56.656 --> 11:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason he's so
controversial is
that Breitbart publishes a lot
of things that

11:01.160 --> 11:08.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are vaguely racist,
anti-Semitic, far, far
outside the bounds of what would
ordinarily

11:08.868 --> 11:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be considered acceptable in U.S.
politics.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think there's quite a
bit of shock
at the fact that he's been
elevated to a senior

11:16.376 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position in the Trump White
House.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talk about
Breitbart News.

11:19.612 --> 11:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got some headlines that
we can show
to give people an idea of what
Breitbart News

11:24.784 --> 11:25.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

11:25.952 --> 11:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Bill Kristol, Republican
Spoiler, Renegade
Jew."

11:30.189 --> 11:32.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Gabby Giffords, The Gun Control
Movement's
Human Shield."

11:32.859 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"The Solution to Online
Harassment Is Simple:
Women Should Log Off."

11:38.498 --> 11:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of Breitbart is Steve
Bannon, and
how much of Steve Bannon is
Breitbart?

11:44.637 --> 11:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, Bannon
doesn't write often,
and I don't think he writes the
headlines,

11:49.809 --> 11:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he's sort of the pirate
captain and the
guy ultimately responsible for
what's published

11:56.683 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

11:58.585 --> 12:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you know Bannon and if
you read Breitbart
News, essentially, what they do
is they set

12:03.456 --> 12:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to shock and scandalize and
upset people
by targeting both political
establishments.

12:09.929 --> 12:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Internet language, they're
essentially
a trolling operation.

12:14.601 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And ordinarily these people
exist on the fringes
of journalism and on the fringes
of politics.

12:20.340 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's so unusual here is
that Bannon
has now been brought into the
West Wing of

12:25.612 --> 12:27.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Josh, I guess
what I'm asking
is, you spent a lot of time with
Bannon last

12:29.349 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

12:30.883 --> 12:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much of what you see on
Breitbart News
is reflective of who Bannon is?

12:35.455 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, he is
certainly a controversialist.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's someone who enjoys being an
outsider
and throwing rocks.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can only speak to what I saw
personally.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bannon, as I mentioned, he's
a former
Goldman Sachs banker.

12:50.003 --> 12:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He reminded me a lot of other
Wall Street
bankers I have encountered, sort
of testosterone-addled

12:55.341 --> 13:02.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and vaguely sexist, but
certainly not racist
or anti-Semitic or some of the
more serious

13:02.615 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges we have seen throw him
and at Breitbart
News.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Mark, you spent
a lot of time
with Reince Priebus earlier this
year for

13:09.922 --> 13:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a profile you did in "The Times
Magazine."

13:13.760 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us who he is and why his
appointment
is sort of being looked on as a
reassuring

13:19.198 --> 13:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing among establishment
Republicans.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LEIBOVICH, "The New York
Times Magazine":
Well, Reince Priebus is the
ultimate party

13:24.804 --> 13:26.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guy.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's basically worked for the
Republican Party
his entire life.

13:28.341 --> 13:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a lawyer by trade, but he's
been the
RNC chair for the last five or
six years now.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's come up through the
ranks through
Wisconsin.

13:37.617 --> 13:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he really much -- very much
is actually
the establishment that Donald
Trump ran against,

13:42.555 --> 13:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Steve Bannon has built a
lot of his career
sort of trying to target and
trying to embarrass

13:48.494 --> 13:50.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and trying to take down.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a really kind of
interesting, if
not somewhat bizarre coupling
there.

13:55.001 --> 13:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Reince Priebus, it's been
said, had maybe
the most thankless job in
American politics

14:00.006 --> 14:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last six to eight
months, trying
to make -- turn the party of
Lincoln or shepherd

14:06.612 --> 14:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party of Lincoln into the
party of Trump
essentially without alienating
everyone.

14:10.883 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, I think to his
surprise and everyone's
surprise, he wound up on the
winning end last

14:14.921 --> 14:16.222 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now he developed a good
relationship with
Donald Trump.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, lo and behold, Donald Trump
has named
him his chief of staff.

14:21.894 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a way, Priebus goes from
being -- having
the most thankless job in
American politics

14:27.567 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to having the most thankless job
in American
government.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we will see how he handles
the transition.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's obviously uniquely
qualified for thanklessness.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

14:37.343 --> 14:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Mark, if he was
what Donald
Trump was running against, why
do you think

14:43.916 --> 14:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump picked him, and
what do you think
Priebus' goals are in the Trump
White House?

14:48.821 --> 14:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LEIBOVICH: If there is one
unifying thing
we have seen in every
appointment or even

14:52.525 --> 14:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rumored appointment that Donald
Trump has
made or is yet to make, it's
that he is loyal.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he likes having his people
around.

15:00.933 --> 15:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Paul Ryan -- Reince Priebus
and Paul Ryan
are very, very close.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Priebus spent a lot of time
trying to broker
some kind of working
relationship between

15:12.011 --> 15:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican speaker of the
House and the
Republican nominee, who had very
much cross

15:16.682 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
purposes.

15:18.484 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, Steve Bannon, very
different in outlook
and temperament and personality
than Reince

15:24.490 --> 15:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Priebus, but they both became
sort of first
among equals, or have become
first among equals,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that they both were very
loyal to Trump.

15:31.430 --> 15:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that seems to be the first
thing that
Donald Trump looks for in
ordering his world,

15:35.601 --> 15:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has been nice to him, who
has been loyal
to him, who he feels he can
count on.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what we're seeing.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think they both have those
qualifications.

15:43.543 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Josh, you know
both Reince
Priebus and Steve Bannon.

15:49.916 --> 15:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Based on what you know, why do
you think Donald
Trump has picked this team, has
picked these

15:54.620 --> 15:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- and he says they're going to
be co-equals?

15:57.123 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think he's put them
together, and
what do you think Steve Bannon's
goals in

16:01.160 --> 16:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump White House will be?

16:03.296 --> 16:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, I think the
reason Trump
picked these two is that they
have essentially

16:07.300 --> 16:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been two of the leading powers
in his presidential
campaign since Bannon came
aboard last August.

16:12.471 --> 16:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a sense, all Trump has done
is ratify the
existing power structure and
move it from

16:18.110 --> 16:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the campaign into the White
House.

16:20.079 --> 16:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what Bannon would like,
by all accounts,
is to take over the Republican
Party and steer

16:26.686 --> 16:31.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it in a more populist,
hard-right direction,
more along the lines of the
populist movements

16:32.024 --> 16:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have seen sweep across
Europe, across Great
Britain.

16:35.561 --> 16:40.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he believes that Trump
is the American
manifestation of those ideas,
and he's going

16:40.433 --> 16:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do everything he can to keep
Trump as someone
positioned outside the party
establishment

16:47.373 --> 16:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington and able to kind
of speak for
that grassroots, populist anger
that really

16:53.946 --> 16:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carried Trump to victory on
November 8.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Josh Green, Mark
Leibovich, we
will see what this team does in
some 60 days.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

17:02.755 --> 17:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK LEIBOVICH: Thanks, John.

17:08.694 --> 17:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN: Thank you.

17:14.634 --> 17:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, as we
continue to mourn
the loss of Gwen Ifill, we turn
to a subject

17:21.841 --> 17:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dear to her: how the country can
overcome
our racial divisions.

17:26.045 --> 17:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since last week's elections,
there have been
increasing reports of hate
crimes in communities

17:30.950 --> 17:32.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the nation.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, the FBI reported a
rise in hate
crimes in the U.S. last year.

17:36.923 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were up by 6.8 percent
overall, more
than 5,800 hate crimes,
including a dramatic

17:42.461 --> 17:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surge against Muslims in this
country, 257
reports last year alone.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's up 67 percent.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the election, the Southern
Poverty Law
Center reported there have been
more than

17:53.572 --> 17:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
400 incidents of harassment or
intimidation.

17:57.443 --> 18:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump was asked
by Lesley
Stahl about the rise in reports
on "60 Minutes."

18:02.448 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That aired Sunday.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I'm very
surprised to hear that.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hate to hear that.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, I hate to hear that.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL, CBS News: But you
do hear it.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't hear it.

18:10.923 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: You're not seeing
this?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I saw -- I saw one
or two instances.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: On social media?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But I think it's a
very small
amount.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, I think it's...

18:17.296 --> 18:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Do you want to say
anything
to those people?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I would say, don't
do it, that's
terrible, because I'm going to
bring this

18:21.968 --> 18:23.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country together.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: They're harassing
Latinos, Muslims.

18:25.371 --> 18:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I am so saddened
to hear that.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I say, stop it.

18:31.644 --> 18:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it -- if it helps, I will say
this, and
I will say right to the camera:
Stop it.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We explore
this with Mark
Potok, an expert in extremism at
the Southern

18:41.754 --> 18:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Poverty Law Center, Eddie
Glaude, chair of
the Department for
African-American Studies

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Princeton University.

18:47.593 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rizwan Jaka, he's chairman
of the board
at the All Dulles Area Muslim
Society Center.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark, you have been tracking
these incidents.

18:55.534 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How have they increased, and
what kind of
incidents are we seeing?

18:59.772 --> 19:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK POTOK, Southern Poverty Law
Center: Well,
we have seen a real rash mainly
of attacks

19:04.744 --> 19:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of on people who are thought to
be Muslims,
but also attacks, or something
less than actual

19:10.016 --> 19:16.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hate crimes, kind of yelling and
hate incidents,
directed at black people, at
Latinos, at gay

19:16.589 --> 19:18.391 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It very much seems like kind of
the lid has
been ripped off Pandora's box
and virtually

19:21.961 --> 19:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every minority out there is a
target.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rizwan Jaka...

19:25.498 --> 19:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK POTOK: We started counting
these incidents...

19:26.799 --> 19:27.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sorry.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK POTOK: ... starting
yesterday, and we
have already counted over 430 of
them.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rizwan Jaka,
it seems to
have affected the Muslim
community very acutely,

19:36.409 --> 19:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but this isn't the first time.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA, Chairman, All
Dulles Area Muslim
Society: No, correct.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, thank you.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Definitely, it's been a roller
coaster of
challenges in the past 15 years,
since the

19:45.985 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
horrific attack of 9/11.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been an increase
in the past
few years.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 2015, over 75 mosques were
attacked.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many people were harassed.

19:55.394 --> 19:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, this year alone, 53-plus
mosques were
attacked.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And definitely in recent times,
we're seeing
challenges where Muslim women
that are wearing

20:03.803 --> 20:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the scarf are being taunted or
harassed or
threatened because of what
they're doing.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's a challenge we have
been seeing.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, it increases around
presidential
cycles.

20:13.746 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in 2011 and '12, we saw an
increase in
stereotyping and bigotry.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's obviously increased in
this past
two years as well.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're all concerned, and
obviously
there's bigotry across the
spectrum, across

20:27.226 --> 20:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all demographics, and we're
concerned about
it all.

20:30.129 --> 20:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Eddie Glaude,
what has this
campaign uncovered that perhaps
was lying

20:35.067 --> 20:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just beneath the surface?

20:37.136 --> 20:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE GLAUDE, Professor of
Religion and African-American
Studies, Princeton University:
Well, in some

20:38.370 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways, the campaign has let the
genie out of
the bottle.

20:41.474 --> 20:45.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's Trump's rhetoric.

20:45.044 --> 20:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nature of the campaign, even
the slogan
"Make America great again" has
given license

20:50.816 --> 20:52.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to hate.

20:52.451 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in some ways, his election
has given license
for folks to act on that hate.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think what we have seen
-- and let
me be very clear here.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want to paint all Trump
supporters
with this broad brush that all
Trump supporters

21:05.965 --> 21:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are out here engaging in these
kind of violent
actions.

21:09.268 --> 21:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we do know is that
there is a certain
segment of the American
population that has

21:14.640 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found in Trump, right, an
exemplar, found
in Trump justification to go out
and attack

21:21.447 --> 21:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority populations, and then
to put forward
an idea of America that is
white, an idea

21:28.087 --> 21:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of America that is heterosexist
-- or heterosexual,
an idea of America that is
decidedly -- let

21:34.260 --> 21:37.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
me just be very clear --
decidedly white in
its makeup.

21:37.396 --> 21:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, while
the Trump campaign
gets a fair amount of credit or
blame for

21:42.034 --> 21:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, how much do global events,
especially
when it looks like -- when it
pertains to

21:46.605 --> 21:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attacks on Muslim, how much
do global
events play into this, in at
least the numbers

21:50.109 --> 21:51.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we saw in 2015?

21:51.544 --> 21:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK POTOK: I think they without
question
play into it.

21:55.181 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, 2015 was a year of some
real atrocities,
incredible attacks from the
Islamic State,

22:02.154 --> 22:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both in Europe, of course, and
in the United
States.

22:05.257 --> 22:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know, people react to
those slaughters.

22:09.662 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also there are a whole raft
out there
of anti-Muslim ideologues who
essentially

22:14.733 --> 22:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exploit these attacks in order
to paint not
merely Islamist radicals, but
all Muslims

22:22.241 --> 22:23.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as extremists.

22:24.009 --> 22:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, of course, for
half of last
year, contributing to this very
large jump

22:29.515 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in hate crimes, according to the
FBI, the
Trump campaign was in full
force, and very

22:35.988 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
active, frankly, in defaming
Muslims in general
and Islam in particular.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think both things
contributed.

22:43.195 --> 22:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to sort out exactly
which is responsible
for, you know, the most
violence, the most

22:48.834 --> 22:50.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hatred.

22:50.669 --> 22:54.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rizwan Jaka,
there seems
to be a conflation between
events that happen

22:54.440 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overseas and Muslim Americans
facing it.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What have your community members
been telling
you?

22:58.143 --> 22:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How have you been personally
affected?

22:59.778 --> 23:00.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RIZWAN JAKA: Yes.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, definitely, there's a lot of
stereotyping
that occurs.

23:03.182 --> 23:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, as American Muslims,
we condemn
terrorism, we condemn violent
extremism.

23:07.886 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's unfair that the
stereotyping and
negative portrayal of the vast
majority of

23:13.659 --> 23:19.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 99.99 percent of American
Muslims that
are peaceful, law-abiding, and
it's conflated

23:19.365 --> 23:21.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that way.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, like, my own wife and
daughter,
you know, my wife is a
fourth-generation American,

23:24.937 --> 23:26.972 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
my daughter is a
fifth-generation American.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were wearing the scarf.

23:28.374 --> 23:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were told to go back home
because of
what they're wearing.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're patriotic Americans.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American Muslims have been here
since before
this country was founded.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thirty percent of enslaved
Africans were Muslim.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The American Muslim population
is loyal Americans.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they are obviously
stereotyped.

23:44.390 --> 23:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, American Muslims
are partners
in national security.

23:47.893 --> 23:50.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we're a part of the
solution.

23:50.462 --> 23:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to make sure that
it's not conflated
and that we need to understand
that actually,

23:56.035 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statistically speaking, the
overwhelming majority
of terrorism is done by
non-Muslims.

24:00.439 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the amount of
murders a
year, 16,000 murders a year, you
know, that's

24:05.344 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done by non-Muslims.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's something that
people need to
understand, that, yes,terrorism
is something

24:10.416 --> 24:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to deal with, but it's
being -- stigmatizing
the Muslim community because of
the perceptions

24:17.356 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and stereotypes portrayed
through presidential
election cycles and through
various portrayals

24:21.627 --> 24:23.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the media.

24:23.529 --> 24:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, why is
it so hard
to prosecute these hate crimes,
to get convictions?

24:27.466 --> 24:33.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK POTOK: Well, hate crimes in
general are
difficult to prosecute because
you are not

24:33.072 --> 24:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merely trying to prove that
someone did something,
someone punched someone else in
the face or

24:38.444 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something along those lines.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are trying to show why.

24:42.348 --> 24:46.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the motivation of that
person at
the time of the attack?

24:46.285 --> 24:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is often very difficult
to get to.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, sometimes, the cases
are crystal
clear.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Someone decides they hate black
people.

24:54.626 --> 24:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They talk about it and they kill
the first
black person that crosses their
path.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But much more often, the motives
are tangled
up.

25:03.135 --> 25:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It becomes unclear whether it's
really a bar
fight over a girlfriend, if
somebody started

25:07.606 --> 25:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to use ethnic slurs during that
fight.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, what part does hate
really play
in it?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, ultimately, it's a jury
question.

25:15.981 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Eddie Glaude,
I want to
ask, what's the step forward
here, because,

25:19.818 --> 25:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you point out, it's not just
by race, it's
not just by religion or general
or sexual

25:24.823 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
preference.

25:26.425 --> 25:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There seems to be an underlying
connection
between patriotism and
otherness.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE GLAUDE: Yes.

25:32.631 --> 25:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, first, we need to
understand the
problem.

25:35.200 --> 25:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think many people read the
election of Donald
Trump as a kind of triumph,
when, in fact,

25:41.907 --> 25:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's an indication of a
crisis, that
in some ways the demographic
shifts in the

25:47.079 --> 25:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country have created all sorts
of anxieties,
as well as the kind of
bankruptcy of an economic

25:51.850 --> 25:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
philosophy that's left -- that's
really eviscerated
workers, black, white, brown,
throughout the

25:58.190 --> 26:00.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

26:00.125 --> 26:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, when you have moments of
crisis, communities
often consolidate themselves by
scapegoating

26:05.330 --> 26:07.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And usually that scapegoating,
at least in
the context of the United
States, has taken

26:09.635 --> 26:11.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violent form.

26:11.537 --> 26:16.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so not only are people
scapegoating Muslims,
African-Americans LGBTQ
communities, right?

26:16.408 --> 26:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying -- in doing so,
they're trying
to draw the boundaries of a
community that's

26:20.746 --> 26:22.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in some ways in crisis.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, how do we respond to it?

26:24.783 --> 26:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we respond to it through
the political
process.

26:27.953 --> 26:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We respond to it by organizing,
by in some
ways making clear our principled
commitment

26:33.292 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to democracy.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's going to be messy.

26:36.495 --> 26:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to require some hard
arguments,
with the understanding that some
folks are

26:41.300 --> 26:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to disagree with us.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to require some
protests.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to require civil
disobedience.

26:46.505 --> 26:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to require actions at
the polls.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to require actions in
our community.

26:51.977 --> 26:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in other words, what we need
to do is
kind of organize ourselves to
put forward

26:56.882 --> 27:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vision of America that runs
counter to what
we're seeing now.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's going to be hard.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be difficult, and
it's not going
to be easy.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we have to do it.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rizwan Jaka,
what's your
community doing in terms of both
protecting

27:09.428 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your own rights and at the same
time making
sure that you're working with
law enforcement

27:15.267 --> 27:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're responsible members
of your own
community?

27:17.769 --> 27:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA: Yes, no, thank you.

27:19.538 --> 27:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, we work very
closely with law
enforcement, local, regional and
national.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We work with the FBI.

27:25.043 --> 27:29.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we try to make sure that the
community
is educated on civil rights and
how to counter

27:29.882 --> 27:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hate crimes and how to prevent
hate crimes
as well.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're focused on that
educational aspect,
you know, for the community.

27:36.221 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We work very closely with our
interfaith partners
in the Jewish community,
Christian community,

27:39.958 --> 27:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hindu community, Sikh community,
and all faith
communities, working together
with our African-American

27:44.630 --> 27:51.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Hispanic and Asian partners,
so that we
can, as alliances, you know,
counter the prejudices

27:51.236 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are affecting everyone.

27:53.038 --> 27:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a KKK flag on a truck
just down
from our mosque the other day,
and they were

27:59.278 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intimidating an African-American
lady.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been anti-Semitic
attacks in the
area.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been anti-Muslim
attacks in the
area.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we have to stand
together.

28:07.786 --> 28:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are working together in
interfaith
partnerships to counter these
prejudices and

28:12.124 --> 28:13.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reach out.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the reach out to those
that might
have maybe the perceptions.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to reach out to Trump
supporters.

28:17.596 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, we call on our
government officials
to visit mosques, visit temples,
so that we

28:23.735 --> 28:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can work together and unite and
heal, rather
than divide.

28:26.338 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Rizwan Jaka,
Mark Potok from the Southern
Poverty Law Center,

28:30.042 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eddie Glaude from Princeton,
thank you all.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RIZWAN JAKA: Thank you.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE GLAUDE: Thank you.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight, PBS
presents the
first part of a documentary
miniseries from

28:38.850 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard University Professor
Henry Louis Gates:
"Black America Since MLK: And
Still I Rise."

28:45.490 --> 28:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This clip from tonight's episode
examines
why the phrase "I'm black and I
am proud"

28:49.995 --> 28:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was a radical idea in 1968.

28:52.798 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Even soul brother
number one, the
immensely popular James Brown,
abandoned his

28:59.905 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
signature patent leather
processed hairstyle
for a natural kinky-headed afro.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Hello.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Don River (ph).

29:07.946 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're on "Black Dignity."

29:09.348 --> 29:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Yes, what's happening,
James?

29:11.149 --> 29:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-BO / I just wanted to ask you
one question.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to know why you got
your process
cut.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES BROWN, Musician: Well,
this is a black
move.

29:16.488 --> 29:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And regardless of what you were
thinking,
we have all got to think one
way.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we look alike, we can
think alike.

29:21.627 --> 29:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The way I see it, it's what
really in
your mind that counts.

29:24.630 --> 29:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES BROWN: Well, the mind
counts, but, see,
we all don't have a good image.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And image is, like, black.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
See, we have never fought
together.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Africa, a man can do what he
want to do
because he know who he is.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Over here, you don't know.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first, we have got to get
our image, an
identity.

29:39.678 --> 29:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: And Brown didn't just
change his
look.

29:44.549 --> 29:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also recorded a song that
would become
a black power anthem.

29:50.255 --> 30:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When we think about, "Say
it loud,
I'm black and I'm proud," we
have got to remember

30:00.298 --> 30:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When we think about, "Say
it loud,
I'm black and I'm proud," we
have got to remember

30:06.571 --> 30:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what a thinker Brown was about
how to deal
in segregated, racist, apartheid
America.

30:16.682 --> 30:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Brown understood from the
experience
he had as a child.

30:20.986 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dark-skinned black people are
especially hated
in this culture.

30:25.490 --> 30:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are seen as the true black
people worth
hating.

JAMES PETERSON, Lehigh
University: James Brown's
impact on the cultural life of
people my age

30:37.335 --> 30:39.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is profound.

30:39.204 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a way in which the music
that he makes,
I don't know if unmitigated
blackness is the

30:43.975 --> 30:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right way to frame it, but he's
just black.

30:47.779 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know what I'm saying?

30:50.315 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Like, unashamed, direct,
forthright, powerful,
in-your-face black.

8:00 Eastern, 7:00 Central.

31:22.147 --> 31:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outpouring of tributes to our
colleague Gwen
Ifill.

31:26.985 --> 31:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France has been commemorating
the first anniversary
of the Paris attacks, where ISIS
militants

31:31.256 --> 31:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed 130 people and wounded
nearly 400.

31:35.427 --> 31:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack on Friday the 13th
last year was
the worst on French soil since
the Second

31:40.732 --> 31:41.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
World War.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how are the survivors coping
with the
trauma one year on?

31:45.937 --> 31:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, we talked to Mark
Colclough, a
British-Danish psychotherapist
who witnessed

31:50.542 --> 31:52.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the killings at a cafe.

31:52.511 --> 31:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
been back to see him at home.

31:56.481 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We're driving
to Funen, Denmark's
central island, where Mark
Colclough now resides.

32:02.921 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's 100 miles from his previous
home in the
capital, Copenhagen.

32:07.592 --> 32:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the search for peace of mind,
he's found
it necessary to immerse himself
in the tranquility

32:12.330 --> 32:13.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nature.

32:13.832 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH, Psychotherapist:
Paris has
changed us on a profound level.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so profound, that we can't
quite touch
it yet.

32:19.704 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within that change for me the
last year, I
have noticed how much I need to
get away from

32:24.109 --> 32:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city and get away from
congregations of
people and sudden movement, and
this kind

32:29.581 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- you know, the head tick
buzz of -- Copenhagen's
not a busy city, by any means,
compared to

32:35.387 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paris, but it's a lot busier
than this.

32:38.757 --> 32:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have really felt the need
to have some
space, some peace and quiet,
where I can just

32:42.594 --> 32:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be myself and I can predict
what's happening.

32:44.996 --> 32:46.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm an ordinary guy.

32:47.032 --> 32:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was walking down the
street in Paris
on an ordinary evening in
November, and I

32:50.936 --> 32:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw absolutely extraordinary
events, have
changed my view on myself, have
changed my

32:56.608 --> 32:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
view on humanity entirely.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: How have you
been doing?

32:59.945 --> 33:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: It's been a long
journey.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can hardly believe it's been
almost a year
already.

33:05.717 --> 33:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I looked through the interview
that we did
in November last year, when we
met.

33:11.957 --> 33:17.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can see then that I
assumed, two, three
weeks of this, I will be fine,
back to work

33:17.596 --> 33:19.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as usual.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Colclough
didn't return
to work as a psychotherapist for
a couple

33:22.267 --> 33:23.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of months.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then he frequently required
time off.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think you're going to be
permanently
damaged?

33:27.973 --> 33:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: Oh, no, no, I
don't think
that at all.

33:30.375 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Is that because
you personally
and professionally have the
tools that enable

33:34.379 --> 33:35.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you to deal with this?

33:35.380 --> 33:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: Yes, I think.

33:36.481 --> 33:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been in and out of
therapy since I
was 19.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's always been in my interest,
has been
psychotherapy and psychology.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm aware that I have tools,
and I have
a quite robust sense of self.

33:46.791 --> 33:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now it's a year later, and I
have had
a really good year.

33:50.528 --> 33:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first couple of months were
very difficult,and
then the summer gradually got
better and better.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the last couple of
weeks, I have
seen a bit of a downturn again.

33:58.403 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Returning to
Paris for the
anniversary has affected his
state of mind.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: I have been back
in Paris
twice.

34:04.943 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And returning to the scene of
the shootings
has been incredibly full of
anxiety before

34:09.481 --> 34:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going, but actually being there
has been incredibly
healing.

34:14.586 --> 34:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mark Colclough
says that
one of the reasons why he's
suffered a psychological

34:21.860 --> 34:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
set setback this year is due to
a decision
by the French authority
responsible for distributing

34:27.432 --> 34:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compensation for victims of
terrorism.

34:30.068 --> 34:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have turned down his
application because
they say he was outside on the
street as a

34:34.172 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
witness and wasn't inside the
cafe when the
shooting took place.

34:37.709 --> 34:42.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, he's disputing this
decision, saying
that he has suffered
post-traumatic stress

34:42.580 --> 34:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disorder for the past year, and,
as a result,
he has had to cut back on work
by 60 percent.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: I'm not looking
for the money.

34:50.388 --> 34:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Even the money feels weird.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It feels like bloody money
somehow.

34:53.358 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I took it as if, as an
authority, they're
saying that the feelings I do
have, the flashbacks

34:58.463 --> 35:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do have, the nightmares I
still have, that
I'm somehow either not entitled
or less entitled

35:04.202 --> 35:05.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to them somehow.

35:05.203 --> 35:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Have you become
more altruistic?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you become less selfish,
less materialistic?

35:09.507 --> 35:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: I have downsized
my life in
many ways.

35:13.611 --> 35:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my friends and my close --
my close friends
and family have said to me,
pretty much across

35:17.983 --> 35:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the board, that even though what
I have gone
through in Paris was horrific,
it's changed

35:22.454 --> 35:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, has made me more human, more
vulnerable,
more available to them.

35:29.060 --> 35:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I find myself tearing up
easily.

35:32.430 --> 35:38.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find myself being more moved
by something
more easily, the human gesture,
how much we

35:38.570 --> 35:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can touch each other by doing
something very
simple for each other.

35:41.206 --> 35:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Last year,
Colclough was
quite certain that he wouldn't
suffer from

35:45.043 --> 35:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survivor's guilt, and would
replace it with
what he called survivor's
obligation.

35:49.381 --> 35:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: I think the
obligation to
live, to live fully and to give
something

35:54.119 --> 35:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to the people that I meet
in my life.

35:56.788 --> 36:02.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw four people's lives
extinguished very,
very quickly right in front of
me.

36:02.861 --> 36:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that obligation is to give
something back
to the people I meet in the
course of my life,

36:08.967 --> 36:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just professionally, but
also personally.

36:10.969 --> 36:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But his desire
to control
his thoughts and suppress his
subconscious

36:15.440 --> 36:17.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have failed.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: The hardest
feeling over the
last year has been guilt, guilty
about not

36:20.445 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having done more and guilty
about not having
-- I mean, I still have dreams
about me intervening

36:26.451 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the gunman and trying to
attack him,
which is -- it was what I was
planning to

36:30.488 --> 36:32.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

36:32.290 --> 36:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew that he would be -- or I
assumed he
would be deaf and blinded
somewhat by using

36:35.126 --> 36:37.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a high-powered assault rifle
inside a small
cafe.

36:37.662 --> 36:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was hoping to attack him
on the way
out.

36:40.198 --> 36:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I decided not to when I
saw he had
two exits from the cafe.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, then I ran.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having seen all these
things, and then
the French authorities saying,
well, because

36:49.140 --> 36:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you stood on a road, we don't
quite recognize
you as a witness of terrorism,
it's very weird.

36:55.213 --> 36:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: If you, as a
professional,
are struggling as you are, how
do you think

36:59.651 --> 37:05.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other people are, especially
those, for example,
who weren't just witnesses, but
who were survivors

37:05.657 --> 37:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in places like the Bataclan,
where there were
bullets flying around their
head?

37:09.961 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: Yes, and those
shot, not killed,
but wounded and dealing with the
physical

37:15.066 --> 37:16.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aftermath of being shot.

37:16.501 --> 37:20.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The path of healing is a very
individual one.

37:20.071 --> 37:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many witnesses have formed
informal bonds
and informal friendships that
are strong as

37:25.210 --> 37:27.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concrete.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel that too with the two
witnesses
I'm in touch with.

37:30.715 --> 37:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our paths have crossed in a day
that was full
of -- a night that was full of
hatred and

37:38.156 --> 37:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
carnage, blood and violence.

37:40.792 --> 37:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, through that, some very
deep, intimate
friendships have been cast.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think they will ever
break.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Since the
attacks, fears
of Islamic terrorism have
slammed shut Europe's

37:51.769 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once open borders and the
continent has lurched
to the right.

37:55.006 --> 38:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK COLCLOUGH: It saddens me
entirely that
we think that stricter borders
and shut borders

38:01.246 --> 38:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brexit and other events that
have happened
in Europe will somehow protect
nations like

38:05.650 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

38:06.651 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't work.

38:11.156 --> 38:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe moving to the right, as
it has, will
bring us a brittle sense of
security, a false

38:18.062 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of security, very false,
but it will
instantly minimize the true
freedom we have

38:23.635 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Europe, and that makes me
incredibly sad
to see.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite being

The professional in him welcomes
them because
he says they dilute the memory,
but those

38:38.283 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
memories will never vanish.

HARI SREENIVASAN: The film
"Loving" opened
nationwide over the weekend.

38:59.437 --> 39:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It tells the true story of
Richard and Loving,
rural Virginians of different
races who married

39:05.476 --> 39:07.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, D.C.

39:07.512 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On return to their home in
Virginia, they
were arrested for violating laws
against interracial

39:12.850 --> 39:13.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marriage.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their case eventually made it to
the Supreme
Court.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

39:17.755 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL EDGERTON, Actor: I'm going
to build you
a house right here, our house.

39:23.695 --> 39:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Loving" tells
the real-life
love story of Richard and
Mildred Loving,

39:30.935 --> 39:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Virginia couple who married in
1958 in Washington,
D.C., because interracial
marriage was illegal

39:40.011 --> 39:46.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their home state.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Returning home, they were roused
from their
bed at night and arrested.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH NEGGA, Actress: I'm his
wife.

39:54.859 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: That's no good here.

39:59.130 --> 40:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A local judge
gave them a choice:
Spend a year in jail or leave
the state for

40:06.604 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
25 years.

40:08.439 --> 40:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They left, but later returned
and appealed
their case all the way to the
Supreme Court,

40:13.211 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a landmark civil rights
ruling, Loving
vs. Virginia, striking down
anti-miscegenation

40:19.083 --> 40:22.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
laws across the country.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Is there anything you
would like me
to say to the Supreme Court
justices of the

40:25.690 --> 40:26.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States?

40:26.691 --> 40:27.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOEL EDGERTON: Yes.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell the judge I love my wife.

40:31.229 --> 40:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF NICHOLS, Director,
"Loving": This was
one of the greatest love stories
in American

40:35.733 --> 40:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history, and I had no clue about
it.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Loving" director
Jeff Nichols:

40:39.470 --> 40:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: I grew up in
Little Rock.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to Little Rock Central
High, which
was the site of the
desegregation crisis in

40:44.609 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
'57.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A lot of its own
history, right?

40:47.378 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: You know, I felt
like I was
-- had a pretty good
foundational knowledge

40:50.381 --> 40:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of civil rights history in this
country.

40:52.684 --> 40:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to not be aware of Richard
and Mildred,
to not know Loving vs. the State
of Virginia,

40:58.256 --> 41:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was kind of shocked by that,
to be honest.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I felt like others need to
know about
it.

41:02.694 --> 41:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yet the film
Nichols made is
not a typical historical drama.

41:06.931 --> 41:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It emphasizes personal stories,
rather than
sweeping movements, two people
who wanted

41:11.836 --> 41:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only to live their lives and
found themselves
thrust into history.

41:17.241 --> 41:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a scene in which Mildred
is watching
television about the civil
rights march.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: Yes, in '63.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH NEGGA: You boys stop that
wrestling.

41:31.656 --> 41:35.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Come help Ms. Laura with her
groceries.

41:35.493 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Coming in around this
plaza surrounding
Lincoln Memorial.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: They say there's
100,000 people there.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Standing by along the
parade route.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: Can you imagine?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH NEGGA: Halfway around the
world.

41:47.772 --> 41:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She's in the same
city, but
she's not really part of it, in
a way.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: No, she doesn't
feel like she's
part of that movement.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she doesn't even feel like
she's part
of that town.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was literally in the ether
outside her
front door.

42:05.723 --> 42:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think she was separated
more than just
by physical space.

42:08.693 --> 42:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- it was, she didn't see
herself as
part of that movement, for some
reason.

42:14.932 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILDRED LOVING, Wife of Richard
Loving: We
was married on the second day of
June, and

42:20.505 --> 42:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the police came after us on the
14th of July.

42:23.441 --> 42:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nichols also
wrote the screenplay
for "Loving," which he based on
the 2012 HBO

42:28.546 --> 42:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documentary "The Loving Story"
Directed by
Nancy Buirski.

42:33.050 --> 42:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD LOVING, Husband of
Mildred Loving:
They came one night and just
knocked a couple

42:39.023 --> 42:39.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

42:40.024 --> 42:41.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I heard them.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And before I could get up, they
just broke
the door and came on in.

42:42.627 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: I just fell in
love with these
two people.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just felt like I knew who they
were.

42:44.328 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And who were
they?

42:45.096 --> 42:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you see in them?

42:46.230 --> 42:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: Well, in Richard,
I saw my grandfather.

42:49.834 --> 42:55.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I saw a man that was a
working-class man that
was unable to articulate his
emotions and

42:55.606 --> 43:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his frustrations, but that was
good at really
one thing, which was working
hard and providing

43:02.513 --> 43:04.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for his family.

43:04.515 --> 43:09.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in Mildred, I saw
actually a lot
of my grandmother as well, in
that, when you're

43:09.754 --> 43:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
married to a man like that, you
have to become
the emotional voice of that
couple.

43:14.725 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, my grandmother was the
one to write
the birthday cards, and give us
hugs.

43:20.131 --> 43:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mildred not only had to be
the emotional
voice.

43:24.101 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She had to be the person that
wrote a letter
to Bobby Kennedy that started a
-- you know,

43:29.106 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a court case that went all the
way to the
Supreme Court and changed this
country.

43:32.410 --> 43:37.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Loving" is a
story grounded
in American history, but in a
twist that may

43:37.148 --> 43:43.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
surprise audiences, Joel
Edgerton, who plays
Richard, is Australian, and Ruth
Negga, playing

43:43.588 --> 43:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mildred, grew up in Ireland,
daughter to an
Ethiopian man and Irish woman.

43:47.859 --> 43:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH NEGGA: We may lose the
small battles,
but win the big war.

43:52.029 --> 43:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did it resonate
personally
for you?

43:54.565 --> 43:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH NEGGA: Of course.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It can't not.

43:57.401 --> 44:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, black and white and
mixed race, those
are things that are part of me
from since

44:01.305 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was a child.

44:03.140 --> 44:09.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the energy, the
ideology, the
spirit of this story is
completely universal,

44:09.981 --> 44:10.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

44:10.982 --> 44:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why it's resonated
with people.

44:13.050 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think you need to be
American
to feel it or act it.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this is a universal
couple.

44:18.356 --> 44:23.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a couple that the world
should be
proud of, not least America.

44:23.261 --> 44:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a couple that -- that
may be unknown
to Americans, but now they --
there's another

44:28.666 --> 44:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple to add to the canon of
people that
you can be proud of in the civil
rights struggle.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What was your way
in to Richard?

44:35.573 --> 44:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the thing you felt you
had to kind
of get to portray him?

44:40.845 --> 44:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL EDGERTON: Silence, the
silence of injustice,
I think, you know, but silence
and stoicism,

44:48.185 --> 44:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but emasculation and impotency
of not being
able to provide and protect,

44:59.297 --> 45:04.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can take care of you.

45:04.135 --> 45:10.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH NEGGA: I know that.

45:10.675 --> 45:21.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOEL EDGERTON: I can take care
of you.

45:21.218 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH NEGGA: I know.

45:26.457 --> 45:33.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL EDGERTON: There's an engine
in a man
that says, I have to be the
protector and

45:33.230 --> 45:34.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the provider.

45:35.032 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I could see in Richard that
he had all
those abilities and facilities
kind of stripped

45:40.871 --> 45:42.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of him.

45:42.707 --> 45:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nichols, who also
wrote and
directed the sci-fi thriller
"Midnight Special"

45:46.377 --> 45:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out this year and 2012's drama
"Mud," also
drew on very human feelings
within a larger

45:55.987 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF NICHOLS: I don't care what
genre I'm
working in, if it's a sci-fi
film, which I

45:59.590 --> 46:03.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made last year, or if it's a
period piece
drama in this case.

46:03.194 --> 46:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to make films that
emotionally affect
the audience.

46:06.797 --> 46:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I'm sitting back, and
I'm thinking
about things, I am struck by an
emotion that's

46:11.002 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
palpable.

46:12.803 --> 46:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this film, it was Richard
Loving coming
home from the bar, sitting down
at the edge

46:16.073 --> 46:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his wife's bed, and saying,
"I can take
care of you.

46:19.410 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can take care of you," when
everyone watching
that moment, his wife included,
knows that

46:24.582 --> 46:25.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he can't.

46:25.583 --> 46:26.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That struck me.

46:26.851 --> 46:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That made me feel something.

46:28.819 --> 46:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if I get shivers, if I get
tingles, then
it's my job as a storyteller to
carry that

46:34.025 --> 46:37.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feeling all the way through the
writing, all
the way through the production
and the editing,

46:37.528 --> 46:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that, when an audience sits
down, they
can feel it.

46:39.530 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all I want to do.

JEFFREY BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: Since the

have received

HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: Since the
news of Gwen Ifill's death, we
have received

47:02.653 --> 47:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a flood of responses from those
remembering
her contributions to journalism
and to their

47:07.925 --> 47:09.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own lives.

47:09.460 --> 47:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We end with some of those, and
some of Gwen's
own thoughts on journalism.

47:20.871 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's information
to be had,
facts to share, solutions to
discover, but

47:30.915 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's information
to be had,
facts to share, solutions to
discover, but

47:42.193 --> 47:44.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have to look up.

47:44.228 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is time we have, time we
lack, and the
ability to take advantage of
both.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The clock is on the wall, but
you have to
look up.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means there are risks to be
taken.

47:55.673 --> 47:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I am Martha (ph) from
Oregon.

47:58.743 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am mourning the passing of
your colleague
and, I suspect, dear friend Gwen
Ifill.

48:04.014 --> 48:09.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never had the privilege of
meeting Gwen
in person, but I still looked
forward to welcoming

48:09.854 --> 48:15.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her into my home via TV many
nights each week.

48:15.559 --> 48:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was such a perceptive and
thoughtful journalist.

48:19.263 --> 48:24.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her insights into the background
of an event,
what had already happened and
what might still

48:24.869 --> 48:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen, and always delivered
with an optimistic
outlook, that was just what we
Americans needed.

48:31.375 --> 48:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Gwen was a friend of ours.

48:35.479 --> 48:45.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She was an extraordinary
journalist.

48:45.055 --> 48:46.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

48:46.991 --> 49:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can be the
person who turns
toward, not away, from the
chance to rise

49:00.404 --> 49:02.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
above the fray.

49:02.339 --> 49:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can be the person who
trains yet another
generation to do better at it
than you did.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: My name is Barbara (ph)
from Lakeville,
Connecticut.

49:10.014 --> 49:14.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My husband and I, both retired,
are regular
viewers of the "NewsHour."

49:14.385 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I write this note with tears in
my eyes at
the passing of a beautiful woman
who contributed

49:19.990 --> 49:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so much to my understanding of
the world.

49:22.092 --> 49:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our deepest sympathies to all
who knew her.

49:25.329 --> 49:27.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She will be greatly missed.

49:27.298 --> 49:35.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She will forever be a role model
for not just
journalists, but for all young
women.

49:35.206 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I tell this to young
people all
the time.

49:46.183 --> 49:49.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather than going around saying,
aha, they
didn't give this to me because I
was black

49:49.587 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or I was a woman, you stop and
think, they
didn't give it to me because
they couldn't

49:53.390 --> 49:55.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
imagine me in this role.

49:55.226 --> 49:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's my job then -- it's a
tougher job
than my white counterparts have,
but it's

49:59.096 --> 50:00.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just what it is.

50:00.331 --> 50:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My job is to force them to see
me in a different
role.

50:04.201 --> 50:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then you act on that.

50:14.245 --> 50:28.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then you act on that.

50:28.792 --> 50:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to be reminded
how easily we
can be denied simple, obvious
opportunities,

50:35.766 --> 50:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how low the ceilings can get and
how much
fortitude it takes to refuse to
accept the

50:41.171 --> 50:44.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
limits that others place on you.

50:44.208 --> 50:47.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you now have the skills to
transcend those
limits.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Whose stories can you tell?

50:49.246 --> 50:51.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whose voices are not being
heard?

50:51.715 --> 50:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who gets to decide which stories
and voices
get ignored?

50:56.053 --> 50:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what are you willing to do
about it?

50:59.156 --> 51:03.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This is Michael from
Texarkana, Texas.

51:03.928 --> 51:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm so saddened to hear of the
loss of Ms.
Ifill.

51:06.964 --> 51:11.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She has counseled me and
explained current
events to me for about 15 years.

51:11.969 --> 51:17.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I haven't been able to face much
of the news
and the analysis this past week,
but I thought,

51:17.608 --> 51:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I was ready to get back in
it, she would
help me make sense of it all.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

51:25.249 --> 51:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: It really
was too bad that she died at age
61, a woman

51:36.460 --> 51:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who was really someone who broke
barriers.

51:39.296 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every step of her life was
something new and
something inspirational for
those around her.

51:45.536 --> 51:51.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I watch as often as I can the
"NewsHour,"
and I will miss her.

51:51.041 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We live in a world
of extremes,
often petty argument, where we
hide behind

51:56.213 --> 52:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our devices to insult one
another in a way
we would never do face to face.

52:02.519 --> 52:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Technology is fabulous, but this
is not what
it is for.

52:06.390 --> 52:12.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to harness our thinking
and our expressions
to add to the debates around us,
not to debase

52:12.629 --> 52:13.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This is Perry (ph) from
California.

52:16.066 --> 52:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her family and colleagues have
lost such a
talented and principled woman.

52:20.904 --> 52:28.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How sad that we lost her during
a time of
such upheaval, when her skills
are needed

52:28.212 --> 52:30.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than ever.

52:30.180 --> 52:39.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cynics thinks that
they know all
the answers already, and then
they stop listening.

52:39.123 --> 52:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Skeptics always have more
questions to ask,
but we are willing to be
persuaded to the

52:44.061 --> 52:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
honesty of an alternate point of
view, even
if we don't share it.

52:49.266 --> 52:56.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it possible to be skeptical
and optimistic
and ambitious, open, excited to
possibility

52:56.707 --> 52:59.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and willing to change the world
as well?

52:59.476 --> 53:05.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I think so.

53:05.282 --> 53:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We want to
give you a chance
to share your memories of Gwen.

Online, you can read many of the
comments
we have already received.

53:29.940 --> 53:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also online, we have gathered
some of Gwen's
words and interviews in our
final edition

53:34.845 --> 53:36.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Gwen's Take.

53:36.246 --> 53:41.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:41.919 --> 53:43.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:43.554 --> 53:44.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:47.124 --> 53:53.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:53.363 --> 53:57.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS

you, and good night.
