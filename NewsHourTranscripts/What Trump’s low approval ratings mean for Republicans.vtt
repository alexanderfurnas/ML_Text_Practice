JUDY WOODRUFF: On Capitol
Hill, Senate Republicans
continue their internal
fight over the health

00:04.700 --> 00:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care bill, as polls show
strong disapproval of
the Republican plan.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And polling in the past
week indicates historically
low approval for the
president at this point

00:15.700 --> 00:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in his first term.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Multiple polls have Mr. Trump's
approval in the 30s or at 40,
and his disapproval rating

00:23.033 --> 00:25.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the 50s.

00:25.100 --> 00:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all that, it's time for
Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of

00:30.566 --> 00:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

00:31.933 --> 00:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's time to talk
about polls again.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't do this every week.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We save it for
special occasions.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:40.266 --> 00:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Amy,
seriously, there are a group of
new polls, three or four polls

00:43.400 --> 00:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out taken in the last week or
so, that do show some slippage
for the president in the

00:49.733 --> 00:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last few months, particularly
among independents.

00:51.833 --> 00:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a Washington Post poll
that shows, what, a six-point
slippage just since April.

00:56.133 --> 00:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right, just among --
in general among independents.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:00.366 --> 01:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: When we
first started talking
about the president
after his inauguration,

01:05.966 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we said this is a president
who is starting with the lowest
approval rating of any president

01:10.233 --> 01:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's been inaugurated.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's see where
he goes with this.

01:14.633 --> 01:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of starting with a deep
reservoir of goodwill and a
honeymoon, which most presidents

01:18.166 --> 01:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start with, he started with
a deep -- he didn't have
that reservoir of good will.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was be going to able
to fill up that well?

01:26.400 --> 01:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reality is, here we
are, six months later, he's
actually 14 points lower than

01:30.433 --> 01:31.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what he was.

01:31.900 --> 01:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not filling it up.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's draining it even more.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And where it's draining
from, it's from independents.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a danger point here,
not just for the president, but
really for members of Congress

01:41.500 --> 01:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who are up in 2018.

01:43.566 --> 01:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a Republican, you
know your base is still behind
you, Democrats have never

01:46.966 --> 01:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been with you, but independents,
those are the folks,
especially for members who sit

01:53.933 --> 01:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in sort of swing type districts,
those are the people that
they can't afford to be losing

01:58.633 --> 02:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by this percentage that
the president's losing by.

02:00.866 --> 02:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If he only has a 30, 31
percent approval rating
among independents, it
makes it very difficult

02:05.900 --> 02:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Republicans up in 2018.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, we
know the Trump folks already
have their campaign committee

02:10.866 --> 02:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up and running for reelection.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they look at all this?

02:14.600 --> 02:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's not clear what
the campaign is actually doing

02:17.933 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in terms of moving
toward reelection.

02:19.766 --> 02:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's held some rallies.

02:22.066 --> 02:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump tweeted over
the weekend that he thought it
wasn't really that bad, that

02:26.000 --> 02:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this poll wasn't so bad.

02:28.266 --> 02:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, the best thing
the president could do to
improve his approval rating -- I

02:35.233 --> 02:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guess there's probably two
things, one, maybe focus on some
of the people who didn't support

02:40.966 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him in the beginning and
maybe try doing something,
anything that wouldn't
be seen as strictly

02:45.633 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
partisan.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the other thing would be,
you know, like, start winning.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has -- you know, he
promised you are going
to be so sick of winning.

02:54.233 --> 02:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, he hasn't
had the major legislative
accomplishments.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The health care bill has
gotten totally bogged down.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was supposed to be
done maybe by April.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's something that
his base really wanted.

03:06.733 --> 03:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he just has not
done a lot of things.

03:13.733 --> 03:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did the executive orders
that the base liked, but that
turned off the independents

03:18.700 --> 03:20.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and others.

03:20.766 --> 03:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we even --
you and I were just -- we were
just talking a moment ago,

03:24.133 --> 03:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy, about when you ask people
even about impeachment, 41
percent in a Monmouth poll

03:31.233 --> 03:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support impeaching
the president.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you were just saying, for
Richard Nixon at this point,
it was much less than that.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: For Richard Nixon
going into the summary of 1973,
his overall approval rating

03:43.000 --> 03:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was basically where Donald
Trump's is right now.

03:45.533 --> 03:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difference is the
intensity of the opposition
or the dislike of President
Nixon among partisans.

03:52.366 --> 03:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had 25 percent approval
rating among Democrats,
Nixon did, in July of 1973.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump has
about 8 percent approval
rating among Democrats.

04:01.733 --> 04:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the intensity of
opposition to the president
has always been an issue.

04:06.366 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Tam points out, he's
not getting the intensity
of support among his base.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he made that decision
when he came into office.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of trying to grow that
base, he had a very narrow
base of support, very narrow

04:19.133 --> 04:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support among all kinds of
voters, except for Republicans.

04:22.666 --> 04:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of trying to grow it,
he's focused and doubled down
on the small group of people

04:28.533 --> 04:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who supported him all along.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, you're
talking about ways where the
president could put some wins

04:33.533 --> 04:35.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the board.

04:35.033 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Health care reform is one of the
issues he has been focused on.

04:38.533 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was another question in
the Washington Post/ABC poll.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this can't be
considered good news
for the administration.

04:47.066 --> 04:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People were asked what
they think about Obamacare
vs. the Republican plan.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
By 2-1, they prefer Obamacare.

04:52.866 --> 04:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Which
is pretty remarkable.

04:56.466 --> 05:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare has seen -- you know,
it's having better days than
it ever had when President

05:02.200 --> 05:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama was president.

05:03.666 --> 05:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I was out in Kentucky
last week talking to voters.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just a few little anecdotes.

05:11.266 --> 05:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One woman I talked to supported
President Trump, doesn't
like Obamacare, but is deeply

05:17.866 --> 05:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerned about the Republican
health care bill, in
particular the Medicaid cuts.

05:22.433 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another voter I talked
to basically said, why
the -- what's the rush?

05:26.133 --> 05:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why are they hurrying?

05:27.366 --> 05:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why don't they slow down
and do this together?

05:29.333 --> 05:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was also a Republican.

05:31.366 --> 05:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then one other Republican
I talked to said he didn't
really know what was in the

05:34.533 --> 05:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, but he was glad it got
rid of the individual mandate.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:38.566 --> 05:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's the
big problem right now.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is nobody
selling this bill.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We're talking
a lot about process.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking a lot about
members who are supporting
or not supporting it.

05:47.866 --> 05:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is nobody out there
really championing this bill.

05:50.066 --> 05:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the president himself is
just sending out tweets saying,
I sure hope you guys vote

05:53.766 --> 05:55.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been saying we're
going to vote for it.

05:56.066 --> 05:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not going out.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not holding rallies.

05:59.066 --> 06:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I looked at the amount of money
that's been spent since the
end of May on ads that talk

06:02.666 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this health care bill;
$6 million have been spent so
far in advertising; 5.8 million

06:07.633 --> 06:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those dollars have been
spent on negative attacks on the
health care or urging senators

06:13.366 --> 06:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote against it.

06:15.433 --> 06:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, without a champion, it's
not surprising to me at all
that the health care bill that

06:18.433 --> 06:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans are putting forward
isn't particularly popular.

06:20.766 --> 06:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's probably
similar to the ratio of what
was spent against Obamacare

06:24.066 --> 06:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when that was being debated.

06:26.133 --> 06:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Tam, this is -- with
the vote now delayed, the
opponents are worried.

06:32.233 --> 06:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the folks who don't want
this are saying it gives them
time to build up opposition,

06:37.100 --> 06:38.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more opposition.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitch McConnell didn't
want to take a lot of time
to let this bill stew.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wanted to hurry
and get a vote on it.

06:45.866 --> 06:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a reason for that,
because the longer it just
hangs out there, the longer

06:49.600 --> 06:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people have to look at
the Congressional Budget
Office score, which is
not out just yet, but

06:54.233 --> 06:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the longer governors have
to put pressure on their
senators, the longer voters have

06:59.133 --> 07:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call into their Senate
offices every single
day, the harder it gets
to make this happen.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's always
easier to fight something
than it is to support it.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, having said this, Amy,
your point about so much of
this has been done behind closed

07:11.966 --> 07:12.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doors.
