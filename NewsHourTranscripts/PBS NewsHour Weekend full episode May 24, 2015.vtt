00:10.677 --> 00:12.012
>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:12.012 --> 00:13.146
FOR SUNDAY, MAY 24:

00:13.146 --> 00:14.448
NEW CRITICISM FROM THE OBAMA

00:14.448 --> 00:16.250
ADMINISTRATION THAT IRAQI FORCES

00:16.250 --> 00:17.918
SHOWED "NO WILL TO FIGHT" FOR

00:17.918 --> 00:19.219
RAMADI.

00:19.219 --> 00:20.487
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:20.487 --> 00:22.122
COLORADO'S LEGALIZATION OF

00:22.122 --> 00:23.357
MARIJUANA HAS ANGERED SOME

00:23.357 --> 00:24.558
NEIGHBORING STATES.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.926
NOW THEY'RE SUING.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.160
>> IT'S STILL ILLEGAL HERE.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.362
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.730
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.831
>> Sreenivasan: AND SOME

00:30.831 --> 00:31.899
PERSPECTIVE ON THE DEATH OF A

00:31.899 --> 00:32.866
NOBEL PRIZE WINNING

00:32.866 --> 00:33.867
MATHEMATICIAN.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.303
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.171
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:38.171 --> 00:40.007
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:40.007 --> 00:42.209
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.610
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:43.610 --> 00:44.745
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.580
NEW CRITICISM OF IRAQI TROOPS IS

00:46.580 --> 00:47.948
CASTING DOUBT ON WHETHER THEY

00:47.948 --> 00:49.149
CAN ACTUALLY BEAT BACK ISIS IN

00:49.149 --> 00:50.817
MAJOR CITIES.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.286
THE U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

00:52.286 --> 00:53.453
COMMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:53.453 --> 00:54.755
SINCE MILITANTS TOOK THE CITY OF

00:54.755 --> 00:56.189
RAMADI, TELLING C.N.N. THAT

00:56.189 --> 00:57.891
IRAQI FORCES PULLED BACK EVEN

00:57.891 --> 00:59.426
THOUGH THEY VASTLY OUTNUMBERED

00:59.426 --> 01:01.528
THE ISIS FIGHTERS.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.763
>> WHAT APPARENTLY HAPPENED WAS

01:02.763 --> 01:03.964
THAT THE IRAQI FORCES JUST

01:03.964 --> 01:04.998
SHOWED NO WILL TO FIGHT.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.166
AIR-STRIKES ARE EFFECTIVE, BUT

01:06.166 --> 01:07.534
NEITHER THEY NOR ANYTHING THEY

01:07.534 --> 01:08.702
DO CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE IRAQI

01:08.702 --> 01:14.675
FORCES WILL TO FIGHT.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.310
THEY ARE THEY ONES WHO HAVE TO

01:16.310 --> 01:18.478
BEAT ISIL.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.113
>> Sreenivasan: SOME 3,000 U.S.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.915
MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE SERVING

01:21.915 --> 01:23.216
IN NON-COMBAT AREAS, RIGHT NOW,

01:23.216 --> 01:24.484
RESTRICTED TO TRAINING IRAQI

01:24.484 --> 01:25.786
FIGHTERS.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.321
HOWEVER, SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN

01:27.321 --> 01:28.822
TOLD CBS' "FACE THE NATION" HE

01:28.822 --> 01:30.524
WANTS TO SEND THOUSANDS MORE

01:30.524 --> 01:32.159
AMERICAN TROOPS TO JOIN THE

01:32.159 --> 01:33.427
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.661
>> FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS,

01:34.661 --> 01:38.899
SPECIAL FORCES, TRAINING,

01:38.899 --> 01:40.334
EQUIPPING.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.702
RIGHT NOW IT'S SHIA MILITIA, THE

01:41.702 --> 01:43.470
SAME ONES THAT WE FOUGHT AGAINST

01:43.470 --> 01:44.972
DURING THE SURGE THAT ARE NOW

01:44.972 --> 01:46.506
DOING THE FIGHTING.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.941
>> Sreenivasan: MEANWHILE, ISIS

01:47.941 --> 01:49.676
IS GAINING GROUND IN SYRIA.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.111
GOVERNMENT T.V. REPORTS

01:51.111 --> 01:52.713
MILITANTS KILLED AT LEAST 400

01:52.713 --> 01:54.448
PEOPLE IN PALMYRA, INCLUDING

01:54.448 --> 01:55.882
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.217
THE ISIS FLAG IS FLYING OVER THE

01:57.217 --> 01:59.653
CITY'S ANCIENT RUINS.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.355
IN CLEVELAND, THE POLICE CHIEF

02:01.355 --> 02:02.990
SAYS DEMONSTRATORS WILL BE

02:02.990 --> 02:04.658
ALLOWED TO MARCH DURING

02:04.658 --> 02:06.360
TONIGHT'S NBA PLAYOFF GAME AT

02:06.360 --> 02:08.128
QUICKEN LOANS ARENA, AS LONG AS

02:08.128 --> 02:09.529
THE PROTESTS REMAIN PEACEFUL.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.098
YESTERDAY'S PROTESTS WERE MOSTLY

02:11.098 --> 02:12.866
PEACEFUL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

02:12.866 --> 02:14.434
THE ACQUITTAL OF POLICE OFFICER

02:14.434 --> 02:15.669
MICHAEL BRELO.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.738
BUT BY THE END OF THE NIGHT,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.539
POLICE HAD ARRESTED 71

02:19.539 --> 02:21.141
DEMONSTRATORS, SOME OF WHOM WERE

02:21.141 --> 02:22.542
ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING INNOCENT

02:22.542 --> 02:23.577
BYSTANDERS.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.045
THE PROTESTS BEGAN AFTER OFFICER

02:25.045 --> 02:26.646
BRELO WAS CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES

02:26.646 --> 02:28.415
IN THE SHOOTING DEATHS OF TWO

02:28.415 --> 02:29.716
UNARMED BLACK SUSPECTS.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.084
NEGOTIATORS ARE CLAIMING THEY'VE

02:31.084 --> 02:32.719
MADE PROGRESS DURING INTENSE

02:32.719 --> 02:34.388
TALKS OVER IRAN'S NUCLEAR

02:34.388 --> 02:35.856
PROGRAM.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.823
BUT IRAN'S LEADERS MIGHT NOT

02:36.823 --> 02:38.525
AGREE.

02:38.525 --> 02:39.760
IRAN'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER

02:39.760 --> 02:41.261
SAID ON STATE-TV THAT IRAN HAS

02:41.261 --> 02:42.696
AGREED TO ALLOW UNITED NATIONS

02:42.696 --> 02:44.498
INSPECTORS "MANAGED ACCESS" TO

02:44.498 --> 02:45.665
MILITARY SITES.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.200
THAT MEANS INSPECTORS WILL ONLY

02:47.200 --> 02:48.535
BE ALLOWED TO TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:48.535 --> 02:49.770
SAMPLES NEAR THOSE AREAS.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.338
BUT THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT IRAN'S

02:51.338 --> 02:53.040
SUPREME LEADER SAID ABOUT THE

02:53.040 --> 02:54.508
TALKS LAST WEEK.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.876
HE VOWED NOT TO ALLOW ANY

02:55.876 --> 02:57.377
FOREIGN ACCESS.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.912
IRAN'S TOP MILITARY LEADERS ALSO

02:58.912 --> 03:00.447
REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH SUCH

03:00.447 --> 03:01.615
DEMANDS.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.916
IN MALAYSIA, AUTHORITIES HAVE

03:02.916 --> 03:04.484
REPORTEDLY FOUND AS MANY AS

03:04.484 --> 03:05.786
THIRTY MASS GRAVES, POSSIBLY

03:05.786 --> 03:07.621
FILLED WITH THE BODIES OF

03:07.621 --> 03:09.089
HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.957
OTHER MASS GRAVES WERE FOUND

03:10.957 --> 03:12.626
EARLIER THIS MONTH-- MOST NEAR

03:12.626 --> 03:13.827
SUSPECTED HUMAN TRAFFICKING

03:13.827 --> 03:15.128
CAMPS ACROSS THE THAI BORDER.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.830
OFF THE COAST, THOUSANDS OF

03:16.830 --> 03:18.165
MIGRANTS ARE STILL REPORTEDLY

03:18.165 --> 03:19.366
STRANDED AT SEA.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.901
TODAY, POPE FRANCIS ENCOURAGED

03:20.901 --> 03:22.169
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO

03:22.169 --> 03:23.870
PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.705
IN CENTRAL NEPAL, THOUSANDS OF

03:25.705 --> 03:27.274
VILLAGERS ARE BEING TOLD TO GET

03:27.274 --> 03:28.375
TO HIGHER GROUND.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.876
OFFICIALS FEAR A LANDSLIDE THAT

03:29.876 --> 03:31.311
BLOCKED A MAJOR RIVER COULD

03:31.311 --> 03:32.546
EVENTUALLY TRIGGER A DEVASTATING

03:32.546 --> 03:34.381
FLOOD FOR MILES DOWNSTREAM.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.349
THE LANDSLIDE CREATED A NATURAL

03:36.349 --> 03:37.851
DAM, AND THE RIVER HAS STARTED

03:37.851 --> 03:38.985
TO OVERFLOW ITS BANKS.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.687
THIS IS JUST THE LATEST

03:40.687 --> 03:42.355
LANDSLIDE FOLLOWING THE 7.8

03:42.355 --> 03:43.723
MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT

03:43.723 --> 03:46.293
THE REGION ALMOST A MONTH AGO.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.994
MORE FINANCIAL TROUBLE IN

03:47.994 --> 03:49.162
GREECE, WHERE THE MINISTER OF

03:49.162 --> 03:50.564
THE INTERIOR SAYS THE COUNTRY

03:50.564 --> 03:51.865
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

03:51.865 --> 03:53.433
NEXT PAYMENT ON ITS MASSIVE DEBT

03:53.433 --> 03:55.102
TO THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY

03:55.102 --> 03:56.136
FUND.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.938
GREECE WAS SUPPOSED TO SEND THE

03:57.938 --> 03:59.372
I.M.F. 1.6 BILLION EUROS NEXT

03:59.372 --> 04:00.574
MONTH TO PAY BACK ITS 2011 BAIL

04:00.574 --> 04:01.708
OUT.

04:01.708 --> 04:02.709
IF LEADERS CANNOT NEGOTIATE A

04:02.709 --> 04:04.077
NEW PAYOFF DEAL, GREECE COULD BE

04:04.077 --> 04:05.545
FORCED TO LEAVE THE EURO AND GO

04:05.545 --> 04:06.713
BACK TO THE DRACHMA--

04:06.713 --> 04:08.048
POTENTIALLY THROWING THE COUNTRY

04:08.048 --> 04:10.150
INTO BANKRUPTCY.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.718
IN CENTRAL TEXAS, DANGEROUS

04:11.718 --> 04:12.919
WEATHER AND FLASH FLOODS HAVE

04:12.919 --> 04:14.187
FORCED ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE TO

04:14.187 --> 04:15.589
EVACUATE.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.623
RESCUE CREWS USED BOATS TO PULL

04:16.623 --> 04:17.924
PEOPLE TO SAFETY ALONG THE

04:17.924 --> 04:19.326
BLANCO RIVER ABOUT 40 MILES

04:19.326 --> 04:20.894
SOUTHWEST OF AUSTIN.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.229
HUNDREDS OF NEARBY HOMES ARE

04:22.229 --> 04:23.730
REPORTEDLY DAMAGED.

04:23.730 --> 04:24.965
SOME PARTS OF TEXAS HAVE GOTTEN

04:24.965 --> 04:26.700
AS MUCH AS TEN INCHES OF RAIN IN

04:26.700 --> 04:28.969
JUST THE PAST 24 HOURS.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.337
TONIGHT, OFFICIALS ARE OPENING

04:30.337 --> 04:32.038
EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND IMPOSING

04:32.038 --> 04:33.373
A CURFEW TO KEEP DRIVERS OFF

04:33.373 --> 04:35.208
FLOODED ROADS.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.510
THE PIPELINE THAT SPILLED

04:36.510 --> 04:37.677
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF CRUDE

04:37.677 --> 04:38.845
OIL OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST DID

04:38.845 --> 04:40.180
NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF

04:40.180 --> 04:41.815
VALVE.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.083
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS THE

04:43.083 --> 04:44.251
PIPE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS

04:44.251 --> 04:45.652
KIND IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY

04:45.652 --> 04:46.987
THAT WAS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE AN

04:46.987 --> 04:48.588
AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF VALVE.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.923
THE PIPELINE'S ORIGINAL OWNER

04:49.923 --> 04:51.391
FOUGHT THE COUNTY IN COURT BACK

04:51.391 --> 04:53.393
IN THE '80s, TO AVOID ADDING

04:53.393 --> 04:54.828
THE SAFETY VALVE-- AND WON.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.229
FEDERAL REGULATORS ARE STILL

04:56.229 --> 04:57.464
INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE

04:57.464 --> 04:58.865
SPILL.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.033
THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNING

05:00.033 --> 05:01.401
MATHEMATICIAN WHOSE LIFE STORY

05:01.401 --> 05:02.669
WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE ACADEMY

05:02.669 --> 05:06.573
AWARD WINNING FILM "A BEAUTIFUL

05:06.573 --> 05:08.008
MIND" DIED YESTERDAY IN A TAXI

05:08.008 --> 05:09.276
ACCIDENT.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.944
JOHN NASH BECAME KNOWN FOR HIS

05:10.944 --> 05:12.145
ANALYSIS OF MODERN GAME

05:12.145 --> 05:13.580
THEORY.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.048
HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

05:15.048 --> 05:16.583
SCHIZOPHRENIA IN THE LATE '50s.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.118
NASH, 86, AND HIS WIFE ALICIA,

05:18.118 --> 05:19.886
82, DIED WHEN THEIR CAB HIT A

05:19.886 --> 05:21.221
GUARDRAIL ON THE NEW JERSEY

05:21.221 --> 05:23.190
TURNPIKE.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.791
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE LIFE OF

05:24.791 --> 05:32.666
JOHN NASH LATER IN THE PROGRAM.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.767
RETURNING TO THE GROWING FIGHT

05:33.767 --> 05:34.868
AGAINST ISIS, NOW SPREADING INTO

05:34.868 --> 05:36.703
SAUDI ARABIA.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.038
YESTERDAY, THE ISLAMIC MILITANT

05:38.038 --> 05:39.973
GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR

05:39.973 --> 05:41.708
THE SUICIDE BOMBING AT A MOSQUE

05:41.708 --> 05:42.976
FRIDAY.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.411
AT LEAST 21 PEOPLE WERE KILLED

05:44.411 --> 05:46.846
AND TODAY THE SAUDI KING VOWED

05:46.846 --> 05:48.215
TO PUNISH THOSE INVOLVED.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.416
WASHINGTON POST REPORTER ERIN

05:49.416 --> 05:51.618
CUNNINGHAM JOINS ME VIA SKYPE

05:51.618 --> 05:53.820
FROM CAIRO.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.522
SO THERE HAS BEEN A HANDFUL OF

05:55.522 --> 05:57.457
OTHER INCIDENTS IN THE SAUDI

05:57.457 --> 05:58.558
KINGDOM OVER THE PAST SIX

05:58.558 --> 06:00.126
MONTHS, HOW HAVE THE AUTHORITIES

06:00.126 --> 06:02.028
CONNECTED THE DOTS?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.230
>> WELL, THEY THINK THAT YOU

06:03.230 --> 06:05.031
HAVE A NUMBER OF SAUDIS THAT

06:05.031 --> 06:08.835
HAVE GONE TO IRAQ AND SYRIA TO

06:08.835 --> 06:10.470
PARTICIPATE IN THE INSURGENCIES

06:10.470 --> 06:11.805
THERE AND I THINK THIS IS HOW

06:11.805 --> 06:13.840
THE ISLAMIC STATE WORKS.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.775
THEY RECRUIT PEOPLE INSIDE THE

06:15.775 --> 06:18.278
VARIOUS COUNTRIES, AND EITHER TO

06:18.278 --> 06:20.714
CARRY OUT ATTACKS OR TO COME

06:20.714 --> 06:22.849
BACK TO IRAQ AND SYRIA AND JOIN

06:22.849 --> 06:25.051
THEM WHERE THEY ARE FIGHTING SO

06:25.051 --> 06:27.053
I THINK THE SAUDIS WERE ABLE TO

06:27.053 --> 06:28.588
SEE THIS, THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO

06:28.588 --> 06:29.789
CARRIED OUT THESE ATTACKS OVER

06:29.789 --> 06:31.157
THE PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE HAD

06:31.157 --> 06:32.525
CONTACT WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE

06:32.525 --> 06:35.161
AND THAT'S HOW THEY ARE GOING TO

06:35.161 --> 06:35.595
IDENTIFY THEM.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.530
>> Sreenivasan: PUT THIS IN

06:37.530 --> 06:38.131
PERSPECTIVE FOR US.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.034
THIS COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF

06:41.034 --> 06:43.003
SUNNI, SHY A.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.904
SHIA ATTENTION THAT ALREADY

06:44.904 --> 06:45.839
EXISTS IN SAUDI ARABIA.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.808
>> YES THEREIS A SHIA MINORITY

06:48.808 --> 06:49.776
IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA THAT

06:49.776 --> 06:51.778
LONG SAID THEY SUFFER FROM

06:51.778 --> 06:53.413
NEGLECT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND

06:53.413 --> 06:57.317
ALSO SORT OF SECTARIAN

06:57.317 --> 06:59.252
INSIGHTMENT FROM THE CLERGY

06:59.252 --> 07:01.688
INSIDE SAUDI ARABIA SO THERE IS

07:01.688 --> 07:03.590
ALREADY THIS SORT OF FESTERING

07:03.590 --> 07:05.625
TENSION BETWEEN THE SHIA AND THE

07:05.625 --> 07:07.093
GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THIS THE

07:07.093 --> 07:08.495
SOMETHING THAT, THIS IS

07:08.495 --> 07:09.929
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAKE THIS

07:09.929 --> 07:10.630
WORSE, CERTAINLY.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.098
>> Sreenivasan: IS THIS

07:12.098 --> 07:13.733
SOMETHING TO TRY TO FIRE UP THE

07:13.733 --> 07:16.102
SHIA BASE TO TRY TO THE TOP IT

07:16.102 --> 07:18.104
WILL SUNNI KINGDOM FROM INSIDE?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.373
>> I AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS

07:20.373 --> 07:22.909
SOMETHING THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE

07:22.909 --> 07:24.611
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING OR

07:24.611 --> 07:28.715
IF THEY HAVE THE SKILLS OR THE

07:28.715 --> 07:29.549
INTELLIGENCE TO DO SOMETHING

07:29.549 --> 07:32.886
LIKE THAT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT AS

07:32.886 --> 07:34.821
LONG AS THERE ARE TENSIONS, AS

07:34.821 --> 07:36.256
LONG AS PEOPLE INSIDE SAUDI

07:36.256 --> 07:38.325
ARABIA AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE

07:38.325 --> 07:40.260
AFRAID OF IRANIAN STATE ATTACKS

07:40.260 --> 07:41.161
THEN THAT WORKS TO THEIR

07:41.161 --> 07:41.895
ADVANTAGE.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.696
>> Sreenivasan: AND OF COURSE

07:42.696 --> 07:45.298
THIS IS THE SITE OF TWO OF

07:45.298 --> 07:48.735
ISLAM'S MOST HOLY CITIES,

07:48.735 --> 07:50.770
MEDINA, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A

07:50.770 --> 07:51.871
CALIPHATE WITHOUT THOSE TWO VERY

07:51.871 --> 07:52.572
IMPORTANT SITES.

07:52.572 --> 07:53.239
>> ABSOLUTELY.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.308
I MEAN, IT IS VERY SYMBOLIC AND

07:55.308 --> 07:55.875
VERY IMPORTANT.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.546
I MEAN, EVEN AL QAEDA HAD SAUDI

07:59.546 --> 08:01.715
ARABIA AS A PRIMARY TARGET FOR

08:01.715 --> 08:02.749
THEIR OWN ATTACKS.

08:02.749 --> 08:06.986
SO I THINK THAT IF THE ISLAMIC

08:06.986 --> 08:08.922
STATE CAN CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN

08:08.922 --> 08:10.357
SAUDI ARABIA CERTAINLY THEY WILL

08:10.357 --> 08:11.991
BECAUSE IT IS A PROPAGANDA

08:11.991 --> 08:13.426
VICTORY FOR THEM EVEN IF THEY

08:13.426 --> 08:14.194
CAN'T GET INSIDE TO TAKE

08:14.194 --> 08:14.861
TERRITORY.

08:14.861 --> 08:15.795
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:15.795 --> 08:16.830
ERIN CUNNINGHAM OF THE

08:16.830 --> 08:18.264
WASHINGTON POST JOIN US VIA

08:18.264 --> 08:19.332
SKYPE FROM CAIRO TONIGHT.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.300
THANKS SO MUCH.

08:20.300 --> 08:31.311
>> THANK YOU.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.679
RETURNING NOW TO THE DEATH OF

08:32.679 --> 08:34.381
NOBEL PRIZE WINNING

08:34.381 --> 08:35.682
MATHEMATICIAN JOHN NASH.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.117
I'M JOINED BY NASH'S COLLEAGUE

08:37.117 --> 08:38.251
AND FRIEND, ROBBERT DIJKGRAAF,

08:38.251 --> 08:39.352
DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR

08:39.352 --> 08:43.256
ADVANCED STUDY IN NEW JERSEY.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.457
>> Sreenivasan: SO FIRST OFF,

08:44.457 --> 08:45.859
MY CONDOLENCES TO YOU.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.826
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MISS MOST

08:46.826 --> 08:48.261
ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND?

08:48.261 --> 08:52.132
>> OH, JOE NASH WAS SUCH A

08:52.132 --> 08:53.967
PRESENCE HERE IN PRINCETON, IT

08:53.967 --> 08:55.735
IS A SMALL COMMUNITY AND HE WAS

08:55.735 --> 08:59.305
A GENIUS OF A DIFFERENT KIND,

08:59.305 --> 09:01.841
SOMEBODY WHO TOTALLY TRANSFORMED

09:01.841 --> 09:03.209
MATHEMATICS, BUT PROGRAMS MOST

09:03.209 --> 09:05.979
IMPORTANT HE WAS SUCH A GENTLE

09:05.979 --> 09:08.014
AND MODEST MAN, A GREAT

09:08.014 --> 09:09.949
INSPIRATION I THINK FOR ALL

09:09.949 --> 09:10.950
MATHEMATICIANS, SCIENTISTS AND

09:10.950 --> 09:11.584
HUMAN BEINGS.

09:11.584 --> 09:12.452
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT WAS IT

09:12.452 --> 09:14.287
ABOUT HIS GENIUS THAT INSPIRED

09:14.287 --> 09:15.955
GENERATIONS OF MATHEMATICIANS,

09:15.955 --> 09:17.357
WHAT MADE HIM, HIM?

09:17.357 --> 09:20.393
>> WELL, I THINK MANY SCIENTISTS

09:20.393 --> 09:22.695
AND MATHEMATICIANS THEY TRY TO

09:22.695 --> 09:25.899
KIND OF CLIMB A MOUNTAIN THAT IS

09:25.899 --> 09:27.434
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE AND THERE IS

09:27.434 --> 09:29.369
A PATH, ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE

09:29.369 --> 09:32.238
VERY DIFFICULT, JOHN NASH WAS A

09:32.238 --> 09:33.740
MATHEMATICIAN WHO JUST PICKED

09:33.740 --> 09:35.775
HIS OWN MOUNTAINS AND PRODUCED

09:35.775 --> 09:38.812
RESULTS THAT NOBODY EXPECTED,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.346
THAT ACTUALLY MANY PEOPLE

09:40.346 --> 09:43.249
THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE, AND IN

09:43.249 --> 09:44.918
THAT SENSE HE OPENED UP ENTIRELY

09:44.918 --> 09:47.454
NEW WORLDS IT COULD HAVE BEEN IN

09:47.454 --> 09:49.689
ECONOMICS, IT COULD HAVE BEEN IN

09:49.689 --> 09:51.624
VERY ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS AND

09:51.624 --> 09:52.592
GEOMETRY.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.027
HE REALLY KIND OF TOUCHED SO

09:54.027 --> 09:54.694
MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.795
>> Sreenivasan: SO HELP

09:55.795 --> 09:57.497
SOMEBODY IN THE TELEVISION

09:57.497 --> 09:59.532
AUDIENCE UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE

09:59.532 --> 10:01.634
LONG-TERM IMPACT OF JOHN NASH'S

10:01.634 --> 10:04.637
WORK ON GAME THEORY OR HOW IT

10:04.637 --> 10:05.405
AFFECTS OUR LIVES TODAY.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.006
>> JOHN NASH BASICALLY PROVED

10:07.006 --> 10:08.942
THAT IF YOU HAVE A COMPLICATED

10:08.942 --> 10:10.810
GAME, AS COMPLICATED AS IT CAN

10:10.810 --> 10:12.946
BE WITH MANY PLAYERS WITH VERY

10:12.946 --> 10:13.713
MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THERE

10:13.713 --> 10:16.015
IS ALWAYS KIND OF AN OPTIMAL

10:16.015 --> 10:17.350
FORM WHERE BASICALLY EVERYBODY

10:17.350 --> 10:19.385
GETS THE RESULT AT BEST AS THEY

10:19.385 --> 10:22.188
CAN GET, AND ACTUALLY THIS IS

10:22.188 --> 10:23.523
VERY INTERESTING MATHEMATICALLY

10:23.523 --> 10:25.358
THAT IT EXISTS BUT IT IS USED

10:25.358 --> 10:26.359
EVERYWHERE.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.295
IT IS USED WHEN THERE ARE LIVE

10:29.295 --> 10:30.597
AUCTIONS, WHETHER IT IS SELLING

10:30.597 --> 10:35.869
GOODS OR SELLING, IT IS

10:35.869 --> 10:37.637
BASICALLY UNDERLYING ALL OF

10:37.637 --> 10:39.072
MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICAL THEORY

10:39.072 --> 10:41.741
AT THIS MOMENT, AND IT IS KIND

10:41.741 --> 10:43.676
OF AMAZING THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAD

10:43.676 --> 10:47.013
A PURE MATHEMATICAL MIND WAS

10:47.013 --> 10:48.681
ABLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN

10:48.681 --> 10:50.049
SUCH, AND HAD SUCH ENORMOUS

10:50.049 --> 10:50.984
IMPACTS ON OUR LIVES.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.018
>> Sreenivasan: PEOPLE WHO

10:52.018 --> 10:54.554
HAVE SEEN A BEAUTIFUL MIND OR

10:54.554 --> 10:55.655
HAGGLED FOR A PRICE UNDERSTAND

10:55.655 --> 10:59.259
HIS IMPACT ON GAME THEORY, KIND

10:59.259 --> 11:00.493
OF MATHEMATIZING OUR DECISION

11:00.493 --> 11:02.328
MAKING BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY ON

11:02.328 --> 11:03.530
HIS WAY BACK DURING THIS

11:03.530 --> 11:05.465
ACCIDENT FROM AN EVEN BIGGER

11:05.465 --> 11:06.666
MATHEMATICAL PRIZE SO HE WAS

11:06.666 --> 11:08.968
STILL .. ACCOMPLISHING FEATS

11:08.968 --> 11:10.537
FEATS THAT MOST OF US HAVE NEVER

11:10.537 --> 11:11.437
HEARD ABOUT.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.339
>> YES, AS I SAID HE WAS THE

11:13.339 --> 11:14.974
ONLY MATHEMATICIAN .. TO WIN THE

11:14.974 --> 11:15.675
NOBEL PRIZE.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.478
HE JUST WON THE ABEL PRIZE

11:18.478 --> 11:20.914
WHICH IS REALLY AN AWARD THAT

11:20.914 --> 11:22.215
RECOGNIZES -- I THINK IT IS VERY

11:22.215 --> 11:24.384
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT HE WAS

11:24.384 --> 11:27.387
A VERY BOLD MATHEMATICIAN, WHO

11:27.387 --> 11:29.188
HAD THIS KIND OF UNIQUE ABILITY

11:29.188 --> 11:31.357
TO TOUCH BOTH OUR ORDINARY LIVES

11:31.357 --> 11:34.928
THROUGH HIS WORK IN GAME THEORY

11:34.928 --> 11:36.896
BUT ALSO A VERY, VERY DEEP

11:36.896 --> 11:38.097
MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS, THINKING

11:38.097 --> 11:40.300
ABOUT SPACES AND ARBITRARY

11:40.300 --> 11:41.734
NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS, THINKING

11:41.734 --> 11:43.870
ABOUT THE EQUATIONS, VERY

11:43.870 --> 11:45.471
DIFFICULT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

11:45.471 --> 11:48.641
THAT ALSO GOVERN LARGE PARTS OF

11:48.641 --> 11:50.143
OUR WORLD.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.345
HE HAD, IN THAT SENSE, I THINK

11:52.345 --> 11:54.647
THAT THE RECOGNITION OF HIS

11:54.647 --> 11:56.349
ALMOST UNIVERSAL MATHEMATICAL

11:56.349 --> 11:59.886
TALENT CAME AT THIS MOMENT.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.054
HOWEVER, IT IS UNFORTUNATE HIS

12:01.054 --> 12:02.956
PASSING IS, I AM VERY HAPPY THAT

12:02.956 --> 12:05.291
HE GOT HIS RECOGNITION AS ONE OF

12:05.291 --> 12:07.060
THE GREAT ESTIMATE PETITIONS,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.561
MATHEMATICIANS OF OUR TIME.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.562
>> Sreenivasan: AND ALSO MERE

12:09.562 --> 12:11.230
THE END OF HIS LIFE HIS ADVOCACY

12:11.230 --> 12:13.633
ON BEHALF OF MENTAL ILLNESS,

12:13.633 --> 12:14.567
WHICH I THINK WILL BE PART OF

12:14.567 --> 12:15.401
HIS LEGACY.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.269
>> YES.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.137
AND SUCH AN UPLIFTING STORY.

12:18.137 --> 12:21.407
I MEAN, HERE, WE HAVE SEEN OF

12:21.407 --> 12:22.809
COURSE THROUGH MANY DECADES AND

12:22.809 --> 12:25.411
ALSO IN HIS DIFFICULT PERIODS

12:25.411 --> 12:27.046
AND HE WAS ALWAYS AROUND, AND

12:27.046 --> 12:29.248
THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY WHO CAN,

12:29.248 --> 12:31.017
KIND OF PUSHES HIS OWN INTELLECT

12:31.017 --> 12:34.020
SO FAR, MORE THAN ANYBODY COULD

12:34.020 --> 12:36.089
POSSIBLY GO, AND THEN KIND OF

12:36.089 --> 12:38.758
CLIMBS BACK AND RECOVERS, AND

12:38.758 --> 12:40.560
THOUGH IT IS REALLY KIND OF A

12:40.560 --> 12:43.630
GREAT A DRAMA, BUT IT IS ALSO A

12:43.630 --> 12:46.265
VERY UPLIFTING STORY AND I THINK

12:46.265 --> 12:48.801
THERE WERE, THE MENTAL HEALTH

12:48.801 --> 12:50.570
WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND WILL BE

12:50.570 --> 12:51.704
REMEMBERED AND A GREAT

12:51.704 --> 12:52.538
INSPIRATION TO MANY OF US.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.807
>> Sreenivasan: ROBBERT

12:58.277 --> 12:58.811
FOR JOINING US.

12:58.811 --> 13:05.084

13:09.288 --> 13:10.857
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.125
COLORADO HAS COLLECTED TENS OF

13:12.125 --> 13:14.594
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX

13:14.594 --> 13:16.629
REVENUES SINCE IT LEGALIZED

13:16.629 --> 13:17.864
MARIJUANA.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.599
TO MANY, THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS

13:19.599 --> 13:22.035
CLEAR.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.237
BUT IN SOME NEIGHBORING STATES,

13:24.237 --> 13:25.805
THE POT POLICY IS ACTUALLY

13:25.805 --> 13:27.040
COSTING THEM MONEY-- SO THEY'RE

13:27.040 --> 13:28.341
TAKING THEIR CASE TO COURT.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.676
THIS UPDATED STORY ORIGINALLY

13:29.676 --> 13:31.110
AIRED IN FEBRUARY.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.478
ALISON STEWART REPORTS FROM

13:32.478 --> 13:33.613
NEBRASKA.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.881

13:34.881 --> 13:36.215
SHERIFF OF DEUEL COUNTY,

13:36.215 --> 13:37.583

13:37.583 --> 13:38.685
STATE LINE WITH COLORADO.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.653
SHERIFF HAYWARD SAYS HIS WORK

13:40.653 --> 13:42.588
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE

13:42.588 --> 13:44.123
COLORADO LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL

13:44.123 --> 13:47.927
MARIJUANA.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.462
>> KEEP IT OVER THERE.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.997
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL HERE.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.931
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.466
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.734
>> Reporter: THE SHERIFF SAYS

13:54.734 --> 13:56.335
HE'S ARRESTED ALL SORTS OF

14:04.210 --> 14:05.578
WITH EACH ARREST THE SHERIFF

14:05.578 --> 14:07.513
COLLECTS MORE AND MORE

14:07.513 --> 14:08.715
MARIJUANA.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.982
IT IS CATALOGED AND THEN STORED

14:09.982 --> 14:12.885
IN THE DEUEL COUNTY JAIL CELL.

14:12.885 --> 14:13.886
>> NOW WE KEEP OUR EVIDENCE

14:13.886 --> 14:15.154
HERE.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.189
>> Reporter: WHICH YOU CAN

14:16.189 --> 14:17.657
SMELL.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.858
>> YES.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.359
>> Reporter: THE SHERIFF SAYS

14:20.359 --> 14:21.861
THAT BATCH OF POT CAME FROM A

14:21.861 --> 14:23.329
MARIJUANA GROWING FACILITY IN

14:23.329 --> 14:24.430
COLORADO.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.232
HE'S ALSO RECOVERED LOTS OF

14:26.232 --> 14:27.400
EDIBLE PRODUCTS IN CARS HE PULLS

14:27.400 --> 14:29.001
OVER ON I-76.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.536
THE NUMBER OF MARIJUANA CASES IS

14:30.536 --> 14:31.738
SOARING.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.239
IN 2011 WHEN COLORADO ONLY SOLD

14:33.239 --> 14:34.540
MEDICAL CANNABIS, THE SHERIFF

14:34.540 --> 14:36.309
STOPPED SOMEONE COMING BACK FROM

14:36.309 --> 14:37.677
COLORADO WITH POT LESS THAN ONCE

14:37.677 --> 14:38.978
A WEEK.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.580

14:40.580 --> 14:42.014
CANNABIS BECAME LEGAL, THE

14:42.014 --> 14:43.649

14:43.649 --> 14:45.084
ONE MARIJUANA CASE A WEEK.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.352
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THERE WERE AT

14:46.352 --> 14:47.854
LEAST FIVE CASES A WEEK.

14:47.854 --> 14:48.988
>> WE JUST GO OUT AND STOP CARS

14:48.988 --> 14:50.256
FOR NORMAL TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.791
AND IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE

14:51.791 --> 14:53.059
ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE

14:53.059 --> 14:54.994
GOING OVER TO GET THIS YOU JUST

14:54.994 --> 14:56.696
CAN'T HELP BUT RUN INTO IT JUST

14:56.696 --> 14:58.131
BY STOPPING A FEW CARS.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.499
>> Reporter: WHAT HASN'T CHANGED

14:59.499 --> 15:00.867
IS THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS

15:00.867 --> 15:02.702
WORKING IN DEUEL COUNTY: THREE

15:02.702 --> 15:04.003
FULL TIME AND TWO PART TIME

15:04.003 --> 15:05.438
OFFICERS.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.806
THE SHERIFF SAYS HIS COUNTY IS

15:06.806 --> 15:08.641
BEING STRETCHED THIN.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.176
>> WELL, WE'RE A SMALL

15:10.176 --> 15:11.577
DEPARTMENT.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.912
WE USUALLY HAVE ONE PERSON ON AT

15:12.912 --> 15:14.113
A TIME.

15:14.113 --> 15:15.414
SO IF THEY RUN ACROSS SOMETHING

15:15.414 --> 15:17.049
THEN THEY'RE HAVING TO CALL

15:17.049 --> 15:18.151
SOMEBODY OUT.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.619
WELL, THEN YOU'RE PAYING

15:19.619 --> 15:21.053
OVERTIME, AND WHERE WE'VE HAD

15:21.053 --> 15:22.388
MORE ARRESTS AND MORE PEOPLE IN

15:22.388 --> 15:24.090
JAIL, YOU KNOW, IT TAKES MORE

15:24.090 --> 15:24.957
TIME IN THE COURT.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.225
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING TO

15:26.225 --> 15:28.427
TRANSPORT PRISONERS BACK AND

15:28.427 --> 15:29.796
FORTH, HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE

15:29.796 --> 15:31.030
COURTROOM FOR SECURITY.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.265
SO IT TIES UP OUR TIME DEALING

15:32.265 --> 15:33.599
WITH THESE VERSUS, YOU KNOW, WE

15:33.599 --> 15:34.634
COULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.002
PATROLLING IN TOWN.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.103
>> Reporter: IT TAKES UP TIME

15:37.103 --> 15:38.871
AND MONEY.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.006
AFTER AN ARREST, REGARDLESS OF

15:40.006 --> 15:41.574
WHETHER THE PERSON IS FROM

15:41.574 --> 15:42.942
NEBRASKA, COLORADO OR ELSEWHERE,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.811
THE COUNTY PICKS UP THE BILL FOR

15:44.811 --> 15:46.445
HOUSING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT

15:46.445 --> 15:48.748
FOR THOSE IN CUSTODY, AS WELL AS

15:48.748 --> 15:50.082
THE COST OF HIRING A PUBLIC

15:50.082 --> 15:51.551
DEFENDER.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.552
SHERIFF HAYWARD SAYS HIS ANNUAL

15:52.552 --> 15:53.920
JAIL BUDGET HAS ALMOST TRIPLED-

15:53.920 --> 15:55.755
UP NEARLY $100,000 SINCE 2011.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.323
>> WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING JUMP

15:57.323 --> 15:59.025
UP $100,000, THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

15:59.025 --> 16:00.626
INCREASE FOR 2,000 PEOPLE TO

16:00.626 --> 16:02.728
COVER.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.096
>> Reporter: HOW ARE YOU CLOSING

16:04.096 --> 16:05.665
THAT GAP FINANCIALLY?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.200
>> BASICALLY OUT HERE, I MEAN,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.668
ALL THE TAX REVENUE IS GENERATED

16:08.668 --> 16:10.002
FROM PROPERTY TAXES.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.637
SO IF THE COUNTY NEEDS MORE

16:11.637 --> 16:13.005
MONEY THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE

16:13.005 --> 16:14.674
PROPERTY TAXES, AND, YOU KNOW,

16:14.674 --> 16:17.810
IT GOES BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
>> Reporter: NEBRASKA LAW ENDS

16:19.645 --> 16:21.380
HERE AT THE COLORADO BORDER.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.282
SO WHILE SHERIFF HAYWARD IS

16:23.282 --> 16:25.117
DOING HIS JOB JUST OVER THERE IN

16:25.117 --> 16:26.752
THE CORNHUSKER STATE, OVER HERE

16:26.752 --> 16:28.287
THE OWNER OF THE FIRST

16:32.491 --> 16:34.026
PEOPLE FULL TIME.

A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY IN

16:37.463 --> 16:40.933
SEDGWICK, COLORADO, A TOWN ABOUT

16:40.933 --> 16:42.368
SEVEN MILES FROM THE BORDER.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.070
HIS STORE, SEDGWICK ALTERNATIVE

16:45.738 --> 16:47.240

16:47.240 --> 16:48.608
NEWLY RENOVATED.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.276
IT STANDS OUT ALONG THIS MAIN

16:50.276 --> 16:51.777
STREET THAT HAS SEEN BETTER

16:51.777 --> 16:53.746
DAYS.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.381
IT HAS BECOME THE MAIN DRAW TO

16:55.381 --> 16:56.949
THIS QUIET TOWN OF 150 PEOPLE.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.050
>> THEY'RE PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT

16:58.050 --> 16:59.285
THE RENOVATIONS I'VE DONE, THE

16:59.285 --> 17:01.220
EMPLOYMENT I'VE BROUGHT, THE

17:01.220 --> 17:02.388
DOLLARS, THE TAX REVENUE DOLLARS

17:02.388 --> 17:03.990
ARE OUTSTANDING.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.524
>> OH MY GOODNESS.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.226
IT'S BEEN GOOD.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.427

17:10.129 --> 17:11.397
THE STREET.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.899
SHE SAYS THE TOWN HAS SEEN A

17:12.899 --> 17:14.767
HUGE FINANCIAL BOOST BECAUSE

17:14.767 --> 17:16.302
EACH TIME THERE'S A MARIJUANA

17:16.302 --> 17:18.237
SALE AT THE STORE, THE TOWN OF

17:18.237 --> 17:19.972
SEDGWICK GETS A FIVE DOLLAR

17:19.972 --> 17:21.540
TRANSACTION FEE.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.775
AND AS LONG AS THE DISPENSARY IS

17:22.775 --> 17:24.477
OPEN, THE CUSTOMERS KEEP COMING.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.378
>> IT'S BUSY, BUSY, BUSY OVER

17:25.378 --> 17:27.713
THERE AND BUSY, BUSY, BUSY HERE.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.115
>> Reporter: EMPLOYEES AT THE

17:29.115 --> 17:30.716

17:30.716 --> 17:32.018
FOR CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT BREAK

17:32.018 --> 17:33.519
THE LAW.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.087
THE DISPENSARY ALSO DISPLAYS

17:35.087 --> 17:36.522
SIGNS DETAILING THE MARIJUANA

17:36.522 --> 17:37.690
LAWS OF COLORADO AND NEIGHBORING

17:37.690 --> 17:39.091
STATES.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.426
YET THERE IS STILL AN INFLUX OF

17:40.426 --> 17:41.360
POT COMING INTO NEBRASKA AND

17:41.360 --> 17:42.695
OKLAHOMA.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.263
SO THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF BOTH

17:44.263 --> 17:46.032
STATES FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE

17:46.032 --> 17:47.800
U.S. SUPREME COURT IN DECEMBER,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.201
ALLEGING THAT THEY, "HAVE

17:49.201 --> 17:50.703
SUFFERED DIRECT AND SIGNIFICANT

17:50.703 --> 17:52.571
HARM ARISING FROM THE INCREASED

17:52.571 --> 17:53.906
PRESENCE OF COLORADO-SOURCED

17:53.906 --> 17:55.508
MARIJUANA."

17:55.508 --> 17:56.876
NEBRASKA AND OKLAHOMA ALSO

17:56.876 --> 17:58.177
CONTEND THAT COLORADO'S

17:58.177 --> 17:59.712
MARIJUANA LAW "DIRECTLY

17:59.712 --> 18:01.380
CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL LAW AND

18:01.380 --> 18:03.049
UNDERMINES THE AREA OF DRUG

18:03.049 --> 18:05.084
CONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT."

18:05.084 --> 18:06.652
AND SO BOTH STATES ARE ASKING

18:06.652 --> 18:08.487
THE SUPREME COURT TO DECLARE

18:08.487 --> 18:09.889
COLORADO'S MARIJUANA LAW

18:09.889 --> 18:11.557
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND IN DOING

18:11.557 --> 18:13.592
SO, UNDO COLORADO'S MARIJUANA

18:13.592 --> 18:15.895
REGULATORY SYSTEM.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.330
BUT THIS PAST MARCH, COLORADO

18:17.330 --> 18:18.764
ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO DROP

18:18.764 --> 18:21.133
THE LAWSUIT.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.369
WASHINGTON AND OREGON- STATES

18:23.369 --> 18:25.137
THAT ALSO LEGALIZED THE

18:25.137 --> 18:26.505
POSSESSION AND SALE OF

18:26.505 --> 18:27.773
MARIJUANA, IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT

18:27.773 --> 18:28.941
IN SUPPORT OF COLORADO'S

18:28.941 --> 18:30.209
REQUEST.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.444
THE SUPREME COURT HAS YET TO

18:31.444 --> 18:32.611
DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE UP THE

18:32.611 --> 18:33.779
CASE.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.880
BILL KELLY IS A REPORTER WITH

18:34.880 --> 18:39.919
NEBRASKA'S PUBLIC RADIO STATION

18:39.919 --> 18:41.187
N.E.T. WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE

18:41.187 --> 18:42.221
ISSUE.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.389
WE VIDEO CHATTED WITH HIM

18:43.389 --> 18:44.790
BECAUSE HE'S BASED IN THE

18:44.790 --> 18:45.958
STATE'S CAPITOL LINCOLN, OVER

18:45.958 --> 18:47.293
300 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE WE

18:47.293 --> 18:48.427
WERE REPORTING AT THE

18:48.427 --> 18:52.498
NEBRASKA/COLORADO BORDER.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.833
MEDICAL MARIJUANA, OBVIOUSLY,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.201
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME

18:55.201 --> 18:56.736
IN COLORADO, AND EVERYONE SAW

18:56.736 --> 18:59.605
THAT RECREATIONAL WAS COMING

18:59.605 --> 19:00.906
DOWN THE PIPELINE.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.141
WHY DIDN'T NEBRASKA LEGISLATORS

19:02.141 --> 19:03.342
GET MORE INVOLVED IN DEALING

19:03.342 --> 19:04.710
WITH THIS POROUS BORDER ISSUE

19:04.710 --> 19:05.811
EARLIER?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.246
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN NEBRASKA

19:07.246 --> 19:08.914
POLICY MAKERS WERE REALLY

19:08.914 --> 19:10.549
PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO

19:10.549 --> 19:11.917
HAPPEN.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.185
YOU WERE STARTING TO SEE MORE

19:13.185 --> 19:14.720
POSSESSION CASES, YOU WERE

19:14.720 --> 19:16.489
STARTING TO SEE MORE DRIVING

19:16.489 --> 19:18.090
UNDER THE INFLUENCE CASES.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.725
BUT THERE WAS, I THINK, A LITTLE

19:19.725 --> 19:21.360
BIT OF THE DEER-IN-THE-

19:21.360 --> 19:22.695
HEADLIGHTS FEELING THAT WE DON'T

19:22.695 --> 19:24.530
KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

19:24.530 --> 19:26.699
RESPONSE IS.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.867
>> Reporter: SOME NEBRASKAN

19:27.867 --> 19:29.402
LAWMAKERS BELIEVE THAT THE

19:29.402 --> 19:31.170
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS TO

19:31.170 --> 19:32.171
CHANGE THE STATE'S MARIJUANA

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
LAWS.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.408
BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

19:35.408 --> 19:36.942
IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO DO: ONE

19:36.942 --> 19:38.711
WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE MEDICAL

19:38.711 --> 19:41.714
CANNABIS WHILE ANOTHER WOULD

19:41.714 --> 19:43.315
INCREASE THE FINES FOR EDIBLE

19:43.315 --> 19:45.251
MARIJUANA PRODUCTS.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.519
THE PENALTIES IN NEBRASKA DEPEND

19:46.519 --> 19:48.220
ON HOW MUCH POT IS IN YOUR

19:48.220 --> 19:49.321
POSSESSION.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.123
A FIRST TIME OFFENSE, UNDER AN

19:51.123 --> 19:52.558
OUNCE, IS A $300 FINE.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.627
MORE THAN AN OUNCE BUT LESS THAN

19:54.627 --> 19:56.062
A POUND IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH

19:56.062 --> 19:57.563
POSSIBLE JAIL TIME AND A FINE.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.098
BUT MORE THAN A POUND IS A

19:59.098 --> 20:00.533
FELONY WITH A MAXIMUM FIVE YEARS

20:00.533 --> 20:02.068
IN PRISON AND OR A $10,000 FINE.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.502
WHILE NEBRASKA DELIBERATES

20:03.502 --> 20:05.104
WHETHER TO ALLOW MARIJUANA OR

20:05.104 --> 20:06.672
KEEP IT OUT OF THE STATE, SOME

20:06.672 --> 20:08.174
RESIDENTS LIKE JEREMY CRARY FIND

20:08.174 --> 20:10.142
THEMSELVES CAUGHT BETWEEN THE

20:10.142 --> 20:12.511
LAWS OF NEBRASKA AND COLORADO.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.146
NINE YEARS AGO CRARY ACCIDENTLY

20:14.146 --> 20:15.648
SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD WHILE

20:15.648 --> 20:17.416
PLAYING WITH A GUN.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.218
AFTER PAINFUL SURGERIES AND

20:19.218 --> 20:20.986
PHYSICAL THERAPY, HE SPENT YEARS

20:20.986 --> 20:22.254
ON MORE THAN A DOZEN MEDICATIONS

20:22.254 --> 20:24.490

20:24.490 --> 20:26.592
BOTOX FOR SEVERE MUSCLE SPASMS,

20:26.592 --> 20:28.194
BUT RECENTLY HE STARTED TAKING

20:28.194 --> 20:29.929
MEDICAL CANNABIS INSTEAD.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.330
HE SAYS IT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE

20:31.330 --> 20:32.565
IN RELIEVING HIS PAIN AND

20:32.565 --> 20:34.667
SPASMS.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.768

PAIN PILLS THEY PRESCRIBED ME

20:36.735 --> 20:38.838

SEVERAL TRIPS ACROSS THE BORDER

20:41.307 --> 20:44.276
TO MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.711
HE SAYS THE STRAINS OF MARIJUANA

20:45.711 --> 20:47.246
HE CAN LEGALLY PURCHASE IN

20:47.246 --> 20:48.747
COLORADO ARE BETTER FOR HIS PAIN

20:48.747 --> 20:49.949
THAN WHAT HE CAN GET ILLEGALLY

20:49.949 --> 20:51.650
IN HIS AREA.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.085
WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU TO

KNOWINGLY BREAK THE LAW WHEN

20:54.987 --> 20:56.422
YOU'RE DRIVING BACK FROM

21:00.226 --> 21:01.060
LIKE A CRIMINAL.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.161
I HATE IT.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.596
I NEVER KNOW WHETHER THE NEXT

COP'S GONNA BE SO I'M ALWAYS

21:04.563 --> 21:06.232
LOOKING AROUND.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.366

21:07.366 --> 21:08.534
SHERIFF OF DEUEL COUNTY WHICH IS

21:08.534 --> 21:10.503
ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES YOU HAVE

TO DRIVE THROUGH TO GET BACK

21:12.004 --> 21:12.838
THIS WAY.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.039
ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT

21:14.039 --> 21:15.641
BEING PART OF THAT GROUP THAT'S

21:15.641 --> 21:16.842
BREAKING THE LAW OR THAT'S

21:16.842 --> 21:18.110
CAUSING HIM AND TAXPAYERS IN

21:18.110 --> 21:19.245
THAT TOWN A PROBLEM?

21:19.245 --> 21:20.412
