02:21.900 --> 02:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

02:23.400 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIED IN A SINGLE YEAR, BECAUSE

HIS 2012 FILM "CHASING ICE"

04:13.900 --> 04:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRONICLED THE MELTING OF THE

04:15.533 --> 04:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD'S GLACIERS, AND WON AN

04:17.400 --> 04:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMMY AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING

04:18.833 --> 04:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURE PROGRAMMING.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CHASE

04:22.833 --> 04:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE AND DOCUMENT WHAT'S

04:24.166 --> 04:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING IN THE GLACIERS OR TO

04:25.700 --> 04:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHASE THE CORALS AND DOCUMENT

04:26.533 --> 04:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE OCEANS?

04:28.666 --> 04:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WORKING IN THE ARCTIC IS

04:29.833 --> 04:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFINITELY COLDER, BUT NOT

04:31.433 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY HARDER.

04:32.933 --> 04:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES.

04:35.466 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN MANY WAYS, CHASING CORAL

04:37.300 --> 04:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS EVEN MORE OF A STRUGGLE FOR

04:39.666 --> 04:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ME PERSONALLY.

04:40.633 --> 04:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MORE OF A STRUGGLE TO

04:41.533 --> 04:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPTURE.

04:42.666 --> 04:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLACIERS RIGHT NOW ARE CHANGING

04:43.666 --> 04:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CONSISTENTLY.

04:45.366 --> 04:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTERESTING THING THAT WE

04:46.900 --> 04:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALIZED WITH CHASING CORAL WAS

04:51.766 --> 04:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE CORAL REEFS- THEY CAN

04:52.566 --> 04:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO FROM LIVING TO DEAD IN TWO

04:53.266 --> 04:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF YOU'RE NOT THERE AT THE

04:55.166 --> 04:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT TIME TO CAPTURE THAT

04:56.333 --> 04:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE AND AFTER, YOU JUST SHOW

04:57.500 --> 04:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP AND IT'S A DEAD REEF.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT WAS A CHALLENGE TO BE AT

05:00.433 --> 05:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT

05:01.333 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THIS ISN'T A

05:03.100 --> 05:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL FILM, BUT IT'S COMING

05:04.333 --> 05:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT IN A TIME WHEN CLIMATE

05:05.533 --> 05:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE IS HIGHLY POLITICIZED.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THAT CHALLENGE IN TERMS

05:09.700 --> 05:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MAKING PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS

05:11.300 --> 05:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NOT GETTING SUCKED INTO THAT

05:12.233 --> 05:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE?

05:14.200 --> 05:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IT IS MASSIVELY

05:16.133 --> 05:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATE FOR HUMAN

05:18.000 --> 05:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIZATION THAT THIS ISSUE HAS

05:19.733 --> 05:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOME POLITICIZED.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO WORK ON

05:24.533 --> 05:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT OUR TEAM IS TRYING TO

05:25.533 --> 05:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK ON IS HOW DO WE DE-

05:26.400 --> 05:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIZE IT.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE

05:29.133 --> 05:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY JUST ACKNOWLEDGES,

05:30.533 --> 05:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKAY, THERE ARE CHALLENGES, AND

05:32.166 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THERE ARE SOLUTIONS, AND

05:33.633 --> 05:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE

05:34.633 --> 05:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLUTIONS ARE.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENYING THE PROBLEM JUST

05:38.533 --> 05:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROLONGS THE PROBLEM.
