JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
A State Department watchdog
criticizes Hillary

00:12.179 --> 00:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's use of a private
e-mail server and
finds longstanding
cyber-security weakness

00:17.985 --> 00:20.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dating back to prior secretaries
of state.

00:20.287 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
tough words by senator Elizabeth
Warren and

00:24.758 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests against presumptive
Republican nominee
Donald Trump, as candidates push
forward in

00:29.763 --> 00:31.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Western states.

00:31.598 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, the nearly
70-year-long
study of survivors of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki,

00:36.470 --> 00:41.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as scientists try to understand
the lasting
effects of the atomic bomb.

00:41.074 --> 00:46.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN DOUPLE, Radiation Effects
Research Foundation:
The Manhattan Project focused so
much on physics,

00:46.313 --> 00:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really didn't know very much
about the
biological effects and health
effects in particular.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more, on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.589 --> 01:00.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.060 --> 01:12.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The debate
over Hillary
Clinton's e-mail practices as
secretary of

01:12.839 --> 01:16.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state is back on the boil. It
moved there
today with a leaked report from
the department's

01:16.910 --> 01:18.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inspector general.

01:18.779 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report found that Clinton
ignored clear
directives about using a private
e-mail server.

01:23.417 --> 01:28.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she never received approval
to use it
for government business. It says
previous

01:28.221 --> 01:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretaries were lax about
e-mail security
as well, but the rules were
tougher when Clinton

01:33.427 --> 01:35.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
took office.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: The
policies, the regulations
regarding the use

01:38.265 --> 01:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of private e-mail have only
really been clarified
in the past several years. Up
until that point,

01:51.678 --> 01:57.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, understanding that it
wasn't encouraged
to use personal e-mail, but it
wasn't prohibited.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton has
acknowledged
that, in retrospect, it was a
mistake to use

02:00.754 --> 02:04.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a private e-mail server. We will
get deeper
into the inspector general's
report after

02:04.391 --> 02:06.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Eleven
states have filed suit over a
federal directive

02:09.529 --> 02:16.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on public school bathrooms. The
Obama administration
has said states must let
transgender students

02:16.269 --> 02:22.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use bathrooms according to their
gender identity
or risk losing federal funding.
Texas and

02:22.442 --> 02:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 other states argue the
directive amounts
to a -- quote -- "massive social
experiment"

02:27.748 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that flouts the democratic
process.

02:29.750 --> 02:34.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The man in
charge of airport
security nationwide pledged
today to do something

02:34.721 --> 02:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about lines that are getting
longer and longer.
Peter Neffenger is head of the
Transportation

02:39.393 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Administration. He told
a House hearing
that the TSA expects to add
nearly 800 more

02:44.564 --> 02:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screeners by mid-June, but he
warned that
still won't be enough.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NEFFENGER, TSA
Administrator: I do think
that we are at a lower staffing
level than

02:51.705 --> 02:56.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to be to meet peak
demands at peak
periods, and we're working the
staffing models

02:56.810 --> 02:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now aggressively with the
airlines to determine
the right number.

02:59.579 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This week,
Neffenger ousted
the official in charge of
day-to-day security

03:03.483 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
operations at the TSA.

03:05.318 --> 03:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
Taliban leaders
announced they have chosen their
top Islamic

03:10.057 --> 03:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scholar as leader. Mullah
Haibatullah Akhundzada
is expected to continue a hard
line against

03:17.230 --> 03:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace talks. He had been a
deputy to Mullah
Akhtar Mansour, who was killed
in a U.S. drone

03:23.270 --> 03:29.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strike last week. Today's
announcement came
as a Taliban suicide bomber
struck a minibus

03:29.209 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Afghan capital, Kabul.
The blast left
at least 11 Afghan court
employees dead.

03:35.449 --> 03:39.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The government
of Israel
tilted further right today, as
Prime Minister

03:39.252 --> 03:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Benjamin Netanyahu named a fiery
ultra-nationalist
to be defense minister. Avigdor
Lieberman

03:44.458 --> 03:47.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is one of Israel's most
polarizing figures.

03:47.327 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a ceremony today, Lieberman
tried to strike
a softer tone, while Netanyahu
insisted he

03:51.565 --> 03:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still committed to a peace
process.

03:53.800 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: France faced a
growing crisis
today, as protesting workers
blocked fuel

03:59.072 --> 04:05.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depots. It stems from a showdown
over legislation
to make the work week longer and
layoffs easier.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neil Connery of Independent
Television News
reports from Calais.

04:09.983 --> 04:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL CONNERY: In Paris and
across many parts
of France, the fuel blockades
are having a

04:16.690 --> 04:23.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing impact on forecourts.
Drivers' frustrations
are boiling over, as petrol and
diesel stocks

04:23.530 --> 04:30.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run low. The French government
insists there's
no need to panic-buy, but many
motorists aren't

04:30.103 --> 04:31.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taking any chances.

04:31.905 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): From
last night
until 1:00 in the morning, I
searched with

04:38.178 --> 04:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my wife for a petrol station.
This morning,
both of our two cars were on the
minimum level

04:42.883 --> 04:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of petrol. And we needed to
drive our children
to school and to go to work.

04:47.487 --> 04:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL CONNERY: The trade union
blockades over
proposed labor law changes have
become a test

04:54.161 --> 04:59.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of wills with the French
government. Oil refineries
are being targeted, and the
disruption is

04:59.633 --> 05:02.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being felt far and wide.

05:02.135 --> 05:07.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has been forced
to delve into
emergency petrol reserves for
the past two

05:07.407 --> 05:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days. This was the scene in
Normandy, as one
main route to the ferry port of
Le Havre was

05:13.446 --> 05:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
blocked by protesting workers.

05:15.248 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ships carrying oil have been
blocked at sea
off the coast of Marseille, as
the protests

05:21.354 --> 05:23.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spread.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And to Asia,
where President
Obama wrapped up his visit to
Vietnam today

05:25.992 --> 05:30.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and headed to Japan. He
concluded with a town
hall meeting in Ho Chi Minh
City, urging young

05:30.363 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to tackle climate change,
and press
for greater freedoms.

05:34.134 --> 05:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, crowds lined the streets
as he left
for the airport and a flight to
Shima. There,

05:38.371 --> 05:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he appeared with Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe,
and reflected on his planned
visit to Hiroshima.

05:42.609 --> 05:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
War involves suffering. And we
should always

05:49.482 --> 05:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do what we can to prevent it.
But I am the
president of a nation that at
times is threatened

05:58.058 --> 06:05.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by very real risks, not
imaginary risks. And
it's important for us to act on
occasion in

06:05.732 --> 06:09.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order to make sure that the
American people
are protected.

06:09.102 --> 06:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: No U.S.
president has ever
visited Hiroshima, where the
U.S. dropped

06:13.673 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first atomic bomb in 1945.
Prime Minister
Abe said today he has no plans
to visit Pearl

06:18.912 --> 06:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Harbor in Hawaii, where Japan
launched a surprise
attack in 1941.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, there's
word federal agencies are
wasting billions

06:27.787 --> 06:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars on maintaining
computer systems
that date back 50 years in some
cases. The

06:34.094 --> 06:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government Accountability Office
reports it's
eating up three-fourths of the
federal technology

06:38.965 --> 06:46.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budget. Examples include a
network for nuclear
forces that still uses floppy
disks, and agencies

06:46.139 --> 06:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that rely on a Microsoft Windows
version from
1992.

06:49.809 --> 06:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Wall
Street rallied
again, on hopes the global
economy might be

06:54.281 --> 06:59.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stabilizing. The Dow Jones
industrial average
gained 145 points to close at
17851. The Nasdaq

06:59.953 --> 07:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rose more than 33 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 14.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
why Hillary
Clinton's e-mail issues are
being deemed more

07:08.028 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious than her predecessors;
backlash against
the VA secretary for comparing
hospital wait

07:13.733 --> 07:20.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times to Disneyland; what we
know about radiation
70 years after Hiroshima and
Nagasaki; plus,

07:20.707 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

07:23.977 --> 07:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a closer
look now at
the State Department's inspector
general report

07:34.387 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Hillary Clinton's use of a
private e-mail
server.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosalind Helderman of The
Washington Post
has been covering this ongoing
story.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the program, Roz
Helderman.

07:44.264 --> 07:48.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first, tell us, what would
you say the
main findings of this report
are?

07:48.301 --> 07:52.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN, The
Washington Post: So,
this was a report that looked at
e-mail use

07:52.706 --> 07:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the past five secretaries of
state, and
it concluded that there have
been systemic

07:57.644 --> 08:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems in how the State
Department has gone
about preserving public records
over the course

08:03.350 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the tenures of multiple
secretaries of
state.

08:06.519 --> 08:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, it was particularly
critical of Hillary
Clinton and her use of private
e-mail. It

08:11.725 --> 08:16.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, for instance, that, that
use did, in
fact, violate department
policies that were

08:16.496 --> 08:22.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
put in place to ensure
compliance with the
Federal Records Act, public
records laws.

08:22.102 --> 08:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And does it say
that the rules,
the guidelines were clear,
should have been

08:27.107 --> 08:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear to Secretary Clinton and
the people
around her?

08:30.076 --> 08:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: One of the
big takeaways
of the report was that the
guidelines had

08:34.080 --> 08:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been not as clear as they should
be going
back over a number of years, and
that in fact

08:39.018 --> 08:43.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the guidelines and training on
those guidelines
have not kept up with the way
that e-mail

08:43.990 --> 08:46.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has changed the way that we
communicate.

08:46.426 --> 08:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, the report does
specifically say
that the warnings about the
risks of using

08:52.098 --> 08:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private e-mail for public
business and the
discouragement from doing so
have become much

08:57.303 --> 09:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more numerous and pointed and
descriptive
while Secretary Clinton was in
office.

09:02.475 --> 09:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, whereas her predecessor,
Secretary
Colin Powell was also criticized
by the report

09:09.582 --> 09:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for using private e-mail, the
dangers of doing
so might, perhaps, have been
more clear to

09:14.220 --> 09:15.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I guess
what I'm what
I'm trying to get at is, is
there any doubt

09:19.826 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the people around Secretary
Clinton -- and
I guess there's no way to know
what she knew

09:24.431 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but is there any doubt that
the people
around her knew that they were
in violation

09:29.602 --> 09:31.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a set of guidelines?

09:31.438 --> 09:34.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: They have
said that they
didn't know that they were in
violation.

09:34.841 --> 09:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one interesting thing is,
she and her
aides have said that she wants
to cooperate

09:39.612 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with all these inquiries, but,
in fact, she
didn't sit with an interview
with the State

09:44.117 --> 09:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department's inspector general,
and a number
of the top aides didn't respond
to questionnaires,

09:48.721 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which makes it harder a little
bit to know
what they had in their minds
while they were

09:52.692 --> 09:54.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing this.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it known why
they didn't
cooperate? I guess the report
says she's the

09:57.330 --> 10:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
only one of the former
secretaries of state
who didn't.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: That's
right.

10:02.001 --> 10:06.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The other four or five,
including current
Secretary John Kerry, did sit
for interviews.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report doesn't provide a
reason why she
didn't.

10:09.709 --> 10:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roz Helderman,
how does this
contrast with what Hillary
Clinton herself

10:15.081 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has said about this whole
business?

10:16.950 --> 10:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: Well, in
some ways, it
fits with what she has said,
although it takes

10:23.056 --> 10:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a much more critical view of
those things.

10:24.858 --> 10:30.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For instance, she has
acknowledged that she
didn't seek approval. The report
criticizes

10:30.363 --> 10:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her for doing that, saying that
she should
have sought legal review and had
other people

10:35.168 --> 10:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weigh in on the security of the
system.

10:37.337 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one other, I
think, question
on everybody's mind is, what
about the security

10:43.710 --> 10:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaches? Does the report get
into what security
was put at risk or security --
what information

10:49.849 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was put at risk because of the
fact she used
this private server?

10:53.820 --> 10:58.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: The main
point of the
report was to look at
record-keeping and the

10:58.324 --> 11:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal records law. And so it
specifically
says that it wasn't intended to
look at the

11:03.897 --> 11:05.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security of the system.

11:05.632 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, it does say two
interesting things
about security. One is that it
just notes

11:10.837 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she didn't provide a full
briefing to
cyber-security officials within
the department

11:15.608 --> 11:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what kind of encryption
and other safeguards
were in place on the system, and
it's critical

11:21.281 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

11:23.082 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the other is that it
notes that there
were several times where people
expressed

11:27.720 --> 11:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fears that the system might have
been hacked,
not necessarily that it was
hacked, and her

11:31.658 --> 11:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people have said that it wasn't.
But they
expressed fear that it might
have been hacked

11:35.395 --> 11:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that those potential
breaches were not
reported to cyber-security
officials, which

11:40.567 --> 11:42.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is another violation of
department policy.

11:42.769 --> 11:47.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roz Helderman,
just quickly,
am I right that the report says
that Hillary

11:47.407 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, the people around her
took her e-mails
with them when she left office,
didn't provide

11:52.545 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a copy of them until a delayed
period of time?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: Yes, that's
right.

11:57.617 --> 12:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's quite critical of that,
noting that she
could have -- even though she
was using private

12:02.689 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail, which is discouraged,
she could have
ensured that the record was kept
by either

12:07.293 --> 12:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
printing e-mails at the time of
her sending
them and saving them, obviously
having staff

12:11.764 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do that, or leaving behind all
of her work-related
e-mails when she left the
department in February

12:17.070 --> 12:18.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2013.

12:18.905 --> 12:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, that process was not
completed until
almost two years later, December
2014, after

12:24.644 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the State Department
specifically requested
them.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Roz, any connection
between this report and what we
know is an

12:31.985 --> 12:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ongoing FBI investigation?

12:33.987 --> 12:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: There is not
a connection.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, they're looking at
two different
things. This report looked at
record-keeping

12:40.293 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Federal Records Act. The
FBI investigation,
from what we know, is looking at
whether classified

12:46.766 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
material was mishandled, sort of
the security
of the system. That is ongoing.
The FBI director

12:53.406 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said that he feels no
external pressure
to wrap that up, although he
does know that

12:57.977 --> 12:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are anxious for its
results.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roz Helderman
with The Washington
Post, we thank you.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: Thank you.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And beyond the
details of the
report, there is, of course, the
politics

13:10.223 --> 13:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Clinton's -- of Secretary
Clinton's e-mails.
And while the issue has followed
her throughout

13:14.727 --> 13:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign on the Republican
side, new protests,
some of them violent, have
swarmed around

13:20.667 --> 13:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the GOP's presumptive nominee.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang reports on the latest
twists and
turns on the campaign trail.

13:26.973 --> 13:34.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: At a rally in
Anaheim, California,
Donald Trump pounced on the
State Department

13:34.080 --> 13:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report on Hillary Clinton's
e-mail practices.

13:36.182 --> 13:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
As I say, crooked Hillary
crooked Hillary,

13:40.286 --> 13:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's as crooked as they come.
She had a little
bad news today, as you know,
from -- some

13:48.828 --> 13:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports came down that weren't
so good. Not
so good. The inspector general's
report, not

13:55.968 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good. But I want to run against
Hillary.

13:59.706 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A Clinton spokesman
claimed the
audit shows her e-mail use was
consistent

14:04.243 --> 14:07.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with past State Department
practices.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidate didn't mention the
report in
an appearance this afternoon,
keeping her

14:12.151 --> 14:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fire trained on Trump and
remarks he made
in 2007, at the beginning of the
housing meltdown.

14:17.824 --> 14:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump actually rooted for
the housing

14:22.562 --> 14:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crash that cost five million
families their
homes. I'm not making this up.
We called him

14:30.436 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on it yesterday using his
own words. And
you know what he said in
response? Well, he

14:39.245 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bragged about what he did. He
said -- and
I'm quoting now -- "That's the
kind of thinking

14:44.784 --> 14:46.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our country needs."

14:46.586 --> 14:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth
Warren, neutral in the battle
between Clinton

14:51.023 --> 14:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders, picked up
the theme as
she emerges as one of Trump's
fiercest critics.

14:55.995 --> 14:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts:
But Donald Trump was drooling
over the idea

14:59.899 --> 15:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a housing meltdown, because
it meant he
could buy up a bunch more
property on the

15:05.071 --> 15:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cheap. What kind of a man does
that? A small,
insecure money-grubber who
doesn't care who

15:14.847 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gets hurt, so long as he makes a
profit off
it.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:20.153 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At his own event last
night in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, Trump
laced into

15:24.290 --> 15:26.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I see this
lowlife, she puts
on an ad, did you know that
Donald Trump was

15:29.428 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rooting against housing, because
he wanted
housing to go down, because he
wanted to buy?

15:34.467 --> 15:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have got some clip of
me from many
years ago where I'm saying, yes,
if it goes

15:38.004 --> 15:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down, I'm going to buy. I'm a
businessman.
That's what I'm supposed to do.
That's what

15:41.741 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm supposed to do.

15:43.643 --> 15:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But his rally's
message was overshadowed
by violent protests outside.
Demonstrators

15:51.517 --> 15:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threw burning Trump T-shirts,
rocks and other
objects at officers.

15:57.089 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police say they responded with
pepper spray
and smoke bombs. They said
several officers

16:01.794 --> 16:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were hurt, and at least one
person was arrested.
Inside the hall, Trump faced
near constant

16:08.401 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interruptions.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You can get him
out. Get him
out.

16:12.104 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: "NewsHour" special
correspondent
Kathleen McCleery was there.

16:15.441 --> 16:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: That was a
woman who was
literally dragged down the
stairs. There was

16:19.846 --> 16:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man who ripped his shirt off,
and they dragged
him away. And, of course, one
that really

16:24.283 --> 16:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got everybody's attention was a
young boy.
He didn't look like he was more
than 10 or

16:28.120 --> 16:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
12 years old, and he stood up
and said something.

16:31.057 --> 16:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't hear what he had to
say, but, of
course, I heard what Donald
Trump said, and

16:34.894 --> 16:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he said was that that's the
youngest
protester he's had at any of his
rallies.

16:38.197 --> 16:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How old is this
kid? How old
is this? Get out of here. Get
out of here.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Still wearing diapers.

16:49.041 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And again today at
Trump's event
in Anaheim, police and
protesters were out

16:53.579 --> 16:55.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in force.

16:55.381 --> 17:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidate also came under
new scrutiny
on a different front. In
January, he skipped

17:00.052 --> 17:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Republican debate and held an
event to raise
money for veterans' groups.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I didn't know we
were going
to raise $5 million. We actually
raised closed

17:06.359 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to six, to be totally honest.
Donald Trump
gave $1 million, OK?

17:11.163 --> 17:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It turns out Trump
never actually
made good on that donation,
until now. The

17:17.470 --> 17:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Post reports that,
earlier this
week, the New York billionaire
took steps

17:22.108 --> 17:28.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to send $1 million to a
foundation that aids
families of fallen Marines and
federal law

17:28.047 --> 17:29.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enforcement officers.

17:29.882 --> 17:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the meantime, Trump added
more delegates
in Tuesday's Washington state
primary. He's

17:34.854 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now just 41 short of clinching
the Republican
nomination.

17:39.525 --> 17:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

17:42.662 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With more on this
whirlwind
day in politics, we turn to
Susan Page, Washington

17:48.834 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bureau chief for USA Today, and
Reid Wilson,
chief political correspondent
for The Morning

17:54.807 --> 17:55.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Consult.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

17:57.543 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start, Susan, with
this State Department
inspector general report on
Hillary Clinton's

18:01.514 --> 18:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use of a private e-mail server.
How much political
damage is this likely to do?

18:06.052 --> 18:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
You know, I don't think it's
hugely explosive.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who like Hillary Clinton
will still
like her.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think it's helpful,
and it lays
the groundwork for the bigger
report to come,

18:14.660 --> 18:18.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the FBI report. That
investigation into her
exclusive use of an e-mail
server is still

18:18.798 --> 18:19.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
There are two
sides of the same coin here.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, it's a lot
better for the
Clinton campaign that this came
out in May,

18:25.871 --> 18:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rather than October. It is -- on
the other
hand, though, it reinforces one
of the sort

18:30.943 --> 18:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fundamental problems that
Hillary Clinton
faces and has faced in her --
most of her

18:35.815 --> 18:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political career, which is
people don't believe
that she is honest and
trustworthy. People

18:39.952 --> 18:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't believe that she plays by
the same rules.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is a real problem when
it come comes
to swing voters. Are the
Clintons throwing

18:46.559 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight? They have just handed
Republicans
and Donald Trump all the
ammunition they want

18:50.196 --> 18:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make that charge over and
over.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it looks like
the Republicans
are going to keep talking about
it.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, I guarantee
that they will,
because this is an issue that
goes to that

18:57.636 --> 19:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fundamental issue of honesty and
trustworthiness.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to be something
we're going to
hear about over and over again
over the next

19:03.042 --> 19:04.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
six months.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let's talk
about Donald
Trump.

19:05.945 --> 19:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reid, as we were just reporting,
this rally
he had last night in
Albuquerque, there were

19:11.350 --> 19:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some protesters on the inside,
but protesters
on the outside were throwing --
setting shirts

19:15.488 --> 19:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on fire and throwing them,
throwing bottles.
We have now seen this at several
Trump rallies.

19:21.027 --> 19:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of thing that
could hurt
him, or do people just say, oh,
that just

19:25.598 --> 19:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comes with the territory?

19:26.732 --> 19:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: I think it could
certainly hurt
him.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sort of ironic that
Clinton is giving
Trump and the Republicans all
the ammunition

19:31.937 --> 19:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they need, and Trump is giving
Clinton and
the Democrats all the ammunition
that they

19:35.041 --> 19:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need. We have heard Hillary
Clinton call Trump
dangerous and unprepared to be
president,

19:40.079 --> 19:41.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unfit for office.

19:41.881 --> 19:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what these scenes of
mayhem and violence
look like. We heard from Trump's
campaign

19:46.919 --> 19:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manager a few -- well, campaign
chairman -- a
few weeks ago that he was going
to act more

19:51.390 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential. I assumed that
meant fewer of
these big, boisterous, raucous
rallies, where

19:55.895 --> 19:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's kicking protesters out.
Apparently, that's
not the case.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I have heard
some people
say, Susan, though, that this
kind of plays

20:01.233 --> 20:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the tough guy that Trump
presents himself
as, and really doesn't -- his
followers don't

20:07.006 --> 20:08.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind it.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, I don't think
his core supporters
are put off by this at all.

20:10.576 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I think there is some
risk for Democrats
if you have protests that turn
violent against

20:15.748 --> 20:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump. You know, you think about
the anti-war
rallies of the 1960s. Those
often rebounded

20:20.186 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against anti-war candidates,
anti-war presidential
candidates like Hubert Humphrey.

20:24.957 --> 20:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans have a big tolerance
for protests
that are peaceful. They have a
low tolerance

20:30.329 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for protests that turn violent.
Slight risk,
I think, also for the Democrats
here.

20:33.866 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about another
other aspect about what's going
on, on the

20:38.471 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic side, and it involves
Donald Trump.

20:41.240 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Reid, it's a new voice
among the Democrats,
and that's Senator Elizabeth
Warren of Massachusetts.

20:47.713 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's been tweeting a lot about
Donald Trump,
but, yesterday, she was out
making a public

20:52.885 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speech, and she was really tough
on him.

20:55.087 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could she become, you know, a --
sort of an
attack dog for Hillary Clinton?

21:00.392 --> 21:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Elizabeth Warren is
a hugely
important voice within the
Democratic Party.

21:04.530 --> 21:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is probably one other
person who speaks
for liberals as loudly as
Elizabeth Warren,

21:08.901 --> 21:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's Bernie Sanders.

21:10.669 --> 21:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if and when Warren is to
come over to
Hillary Clinton's side, her
endorsement will

21:14.507 --> 21:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean a great deal in terms of
healing the
party. I think this is the --
sort of the

21:18.077 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning steps of getting
towards an endorsement
of Hillary Clinton, the
extremely likely eventual

21:24.683 --> 21:26.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going after Donald Trump Sets up
a contrast.
No matter what a liberal voter
thinks about

21:29.755 --> 21:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie
Sanders, Hillary
Clinton's a lot better for that
voter than

21:33.893 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump would be.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the role she
plays?

21:36.929 --> 21:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: She's a great --
this is an example
of how Donald Trump can do what
Hillary Clinton

21:39.798 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't done so far, which is
unite the Democratic
Party. Elizabeth Warren has not
yet endorsed

21:44.737 --> 21:45.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: The two of them
aren't really
close. She's the only woman
senator who has

21:49.542 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not endorsed Hillary Clinton
yet. We assume
she will eventually.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is an example of how
she can be a
really effective advocate for
Hillary Clinton

21:56.415 --> 21:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without even mentioning Hillary
Clinton's
name, because Elizabeth Warren
has figured

21:59.385 --> 22:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out how to get under Donald
Trump's skin.
You can tell from his responses
that he is

22:04.490 --> 22:07.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
disturbed by some of the
criticism that she
has made.

22:07.626 --> 22:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, he came back
and called
her Pocahontas, making fun of
the fact that,

22:11.630 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at one point, she talked about
her distant
and I guess tiny Native American
heritage,

22:17.937 --> 22:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reid. But Trump doesn't -- isn't
one to let
any criticism lie, is he?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: Yes, although Susan
brings up
an important point here.

22:25.878 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a few things -- sure,
he will fire
back at anybody over anything,
but there are

22:30.182 --> 22:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few things that really bug him.
Elizabeth
Warren's criticism is one.
Questions about

22:34.720 --> 22:39.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump University have been
another. Questions
about his net worth, especially,
tend to get

22:39.458 --> 22:41.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under his skin.

22:41.227 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Republicans never
figured out how
to effectively go after Trump
and undercut

22:45.497 --> 22:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him with his core supporters.
You know, Democrats
only get one shot. They don't
get a whole

22:49.602 --> 22:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bunch of primaries. They only
get the one
shot in November. So they need
to sort of

22:54.473 --> 22:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start experimenting, figuring
out the right
way to undercut his support
among as many

22:59.912 --> 23:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his core voters as they can,
raise his
unfavorable ratings, make him
unpalatable

23:05.718 --> 23:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to swing voters, and finally to
get under
his skin and make him look
unpresidential.

23:09.521 --> 23:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk,
Susan, quickly
the contest that is still out
there for Hillary

23:13.392 --> 23:15.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, Bernie Sanders
still very much
competing, the two of them
spending a whole

23:17.296 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lot of time this week in
California. They're
going to be voting on June 7.
What does California

23:23.369 --> 23:25.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
look like?

23:25.104 --> 23:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, we think
Hillary Clinton
has a lead there, a significant
lead, not

23:27.473 --> 23:29.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an overwhelming one.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's her kind of state, in that
it's racially
a very diverse state. That's
been good for

23:32.244 --> 23:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her. We think she will win in
California.
In fact, she's almost guaranteed
to go over

23:36.081 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the top, to just clinch,
numerically clinch
her nomination with the June 7
primary.

23:40.719 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, even if she loses
in California,
she will clinch her nomination
in the California

23:45.591 --> 23:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary, given proportional
allocation of
delegates. But I think it looks
like she's

23:49.595 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to win. And that will be
important kind
of psychologically, to not have
that last,

23:54.166 --> 23:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biggest primary be one in which
Bernie Sanders
comes on strong and defeats her.

23:58.203 --> 24:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The optics could
be bad for
her if she were to lose. But
it's your sense

24:02.608 --> 24:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's looking pretty good
for her?

24:04.877 --> 24:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: That's what the
public polling
has shown. Bernie Sanders sort
of needs an

24:10.015 --> 24:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off-ramp. He needs a reason to
get out of
this race. And losing California
is that off-ramp.

24:15.354 --> 24:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be really tough
for Bernie Sanders
to say, all right, I'm quitting
after he just

24:19.591 --> 24:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won a bunch of states. There are
four other
states up. At least one of them,
Montana,

24:24.063 --> 24:27.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Dakota, those are probably
states that
are going to be better for
Sanders than they

24:27.132 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be for Clinton.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
watching it all,
Reid Wilson, Susan Page, thank
you.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

24:33.405 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: Yes.

24:39.244 --> 24:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Department
of Veterans
Affairs is back in the
crosshairs with its

24:47.152 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary, Robert McDonald,
making some controversial
comments.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had planned to interview the
secretary
today, but his office called
last night to

24:53.659 --> 24:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say his schedule was now full.
We hope to
have an interview with him in
the near future.

24:58.497 --> 25:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we take a look now at the
recent controversy
and the persistent problems of
delivering

25:03.535 --> 25:06.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vets proper care.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the head of the
Department of
Veterans Affairs posted the
closest thing

25:09.441 --> 25:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to an apology: "If my comments
Monday led
any veterans to believe that I
or the dedicated

25:14.780 --> 25:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work force I am privileged to
lead don't take
that noble mission seriously, I
deeply regret

25:20.352 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. Nothing could be further
from the truth."

25:22.755 --> 25:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The comments Secretary Bob
McDonald is referring
to came Monday morning at a
breakfast with

25:28.093 --> 25:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporters, where he downplayed
the importance
of measuring wait times for
medical appointments.

25:32.865 --> 25:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MCDONALD, U.S. Veterans
Affairs Secretary:
What really counts is, how does
the veteran

25:37.202 --> 25:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel about their encounter with
the VA? When
you go to Disney, do they
measure the number

25:42.141 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hours you wait in line or the
number -- you
know, what is important? What's
important

25:45.811 --> 25:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, what is your satisfaction
with the experience?

25:48.981 --> 25:53.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Reaction was
swift. A visibly-angry
speaker of the House, Paul Ryan:

25:53.152 --> 25:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
When the VA's secretary compared
the lines

25:56.622 --> 26:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at his agency to lines at an
amusement park,
we were dumbfounded. This is not
make-believe;

26:05.431 --> 26:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is not Disneyland, or
Wonderland, for
that matter. Veterans have died
waiting in

26:12.571 --> 26:15.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line for their care.

26:15.207 --> 26:21.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clearly, the secretary's
comments were not
worthy of the veterans that he
serves. But

26:21.513 --> 26:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're also indicative of a
culture of indifference
at the VA.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republican
Conference Chairwoman
Cathy McMorris Rodgers:

26:28.220 --> 26:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R),
Washington:
When you go to Disneyland, you
aren't wondering

26:32.257 --> 26:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are going to live long
enough to make
it to Space Mountain. Clearly,
the VA is not

26:39.097 --> 26:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the happiest place on earth, and
veterans
have died waiting in these
lines; 18 percent

26:46.538 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of appointment cancellations go
unfilled.
We can do better.

26:50.409 --> 26:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: However,
veterans groups
who have been vocal about
problems at the

26:54.313 --> 26:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VA offered a more nuanced
reaction.

26:56.381 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PORTER, Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans
of America: His statements were
certainly

26:58.684 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poorly wondered. I don't think
they were they
were meant to do any harm to
veterans, certainly.

27:04.289 --> 27:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that he's got a big job
to do, and
we need him to stick in that job
and keep

27:09.228 --> 27:11.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moving forward with his
department to serve
veterans better.

27:11.763 --> 27:15.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thomas Porter
served in
Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf
and is the

27:15.968 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legislative director for Iraq
and Afghanistan
Veterans of America.

27:20.172 --> 27:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PORTER: He's certainly
changed the
way that the VA is looking at
the problem.

27:26.078 --> 27:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been very transparent. He's
been open
with the VSOs, the veterans
service organizations.

27:31.216 --> 27:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's making a genuine effort
to address
the problem.

27:35.287 --> 27:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We understand that the wait
lines have been
reduced dramatically since this
scandal first

27:41.059 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started coming to light. We want
to keep the
VA going in that direction.

27:45.531 --> 27:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wait times for
vets to see
a doctor is a sensitive, and
explosive, issue.

27:50.869 --> 27:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The delays and a cover-up cost
the last VA
secretary, retired Army General
Eric Shinseki,

27:55.841 --> 27:58.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the job in 2014.

27:58.176 --> 28:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a VA doctor blew the
whistle at a Phoenix
facility, an inspector general
investigation

28:03.415 --> 28:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found that Phoenix-area veterans
seeking care
had to wait an average of 115
days, almost

28:10.188 --> 28:16.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
four months, for a first
appointment; 1,700
veterans were kept off any
official waiting

28:16.161 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
list, and were at risk of being
lost or forgotten.

28:19.531 --> 28:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other investigations found this
type of problem
existed at many VA hospitals
throughout the

28:24.036 --> 28:29.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. More recently, the
Government Accountability
Office reported that the VA's
system for tracking

28:29.274 --> 28:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how long veterans have to wait
for an appointment
was flawed, making it hard to
identify and

28:34.780 --> 28:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remedy scheduling problems.

28:37.449 --> 28:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The VA's network of hospitals
and clinics
is one of the largest health
care systems

28:41.219 --> 28:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S., with hundreds of
thousands of
veterans in need of care.

28:49.027 --> 28:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:58.236 --> 29:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Should the U.S.
soldiers involved in the Afghan
hospital attack

29:03.809 --> 29:06.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be court-martialed?
Japan

29:06.345 --> 29:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But first what
science is still
learning from the survivors of
the Hiroshima

29:14.186 --> 29:16.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Nagasaki bombings.

29:16.221 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, President Obama
becomes the first
sitting president to visit
Hiroshima.

29:21.493 --> 29:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien looks at how much
of what we
know about the impact of
radiation comes from

29:26.898 --> 29:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a study about the long-term
effects there.
It's part of our weekly series
on the Leading

29:32.371 --> 29:33.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Edge of science.

29:33.972 --> 29:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And warning: Some images might
be disturbing
to some viewers.

29:37.542 --> 29:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The scientists
who designed
the first atomic weapons didn't
spend much

29:42.447 --> 29:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time researching the long-term
health consequences
of their devastating creation.

29:47.285 --> 29:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN DOUPLE, Radiation Effects
Research Foundation:
The Manhattan Project focused so
much on physics,

29:52.124 --> 29:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really didn't know very much
about the
biological effects and health
effects in particular.

29:58.764 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When I met him in
2012, radiation
biophysicist Evan Douple was the
associate

30:04.369 --> 30:10.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chief of research at the
Radiation Effects
Research Foundation. The joint
Japanese and

30:10.275 --> 30:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. study has been following
the survivors
of the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

30:16.548 --> 30:18.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for nearly 70 years.

30:18.183 --> 30:22.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EVAN DOUPLE: There isn't
anything comparable
to this kind of study.

30:22.254 --> 30:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The work began
almost immediately
after the war, when President
Truman ordered

30:27.325 --> 30:31.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the creation the Atomic Bomb
Casualty Commission
in 1946.

30:31.530 --> 30:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN DOUPLE: The scientists have
recreated
through interviews and
questionnaires the

30:39.037 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
locations of where each
individual survivor
was exposed, and so they could
reconstruct

30:45.644 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by line of sight what the
radiation quantities
would be at different distances.

30:51.550 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ninety-four
thousand irradiated
bomb survivors volunteered to
become subjects.

30:57.589 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another 26,000 who lived in
other Japanese
cities during the bombings, but
were not exposed

31:02.794 --> 31:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to radiation, were included as a
comparison
or control group.

31:07.733 --> 31:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, about a third of the
exposed and comparison
subjects are still alive, many
making routine

31:14.706 --> 31:21.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pilgrimages up a hill
overlooking the once
devastated city of Hiroshima to
undergo medical

31:21.146 --> 31:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exams. Their blood is routinely
analyzed,
researchers on the lookout for
damaged chromosomes

31:27.219 --> 31:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and other signs of disease.

31:29.855 --> 31:33.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, they have frozen
thousands
of blood and tissue samples.

31:33.959 --> 31:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN DOUPLE: If that survivor
comes down with
a cancer or a health effect
today, one can

31:41.633 --> 31:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go back into the freezer and
perhaps find
what changed in that individual
that eventually

31:48.507 --> 31:51.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ended up resulting in a cancer.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Researchers here
have published
hundreds of papers documenting
the links between

31:55.881 --> 32:01.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radiation and its ill health
effects, primarily
cancer. They have written the
book that is

32:01.219 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the basis for the standards for
acceptable
radiation exposure.

32:05.791 --> 32:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the findings over the
years: Thyroid
cancer and leukemia are the
first to strike.

32:11.129 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Solid cancers come 10 to 30
years later. Young
people are more susceptible to
developing

32:16.868 --> 32:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer than adults, and women
are more susceptible
than men. Perhaps the most
important, a single

32:23.475 --> 32:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exposure increases cancer risk
for life.

32:27.212 --> 32:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bottom line? Of 94,000
survivors studied
over 70 years, about 1,000
additional cases

32:34.252 --> 32:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of cancer can be attributed to
radiation from
the bombs.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BOICE, National Council on
Radiation
Protection and Measurements: So,
the atomic

32:39.524 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomb survivors study, which is a
remarkable
study -- it's the gold standard
in terms of

32:44.229 --> 32:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radiation epidemiology -- it has
limitations,
and one of the limitations is,
the dose was

32:48.333 --> 32:50.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
given all at once.

32:50.135 --> 32:54.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Radiation
epidemiologist John
Boice is hoping to address that
limitation.

32:54.806 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is spearheading a study of
workers from
the Manhattan Project, atomic
veterans who

33:01.713 --> 33:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witnessed atmospheric bomb
tests, utility
employees at nuclear power
plants, and medical

33:07.886 --> 33:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
professionals, one million in
all.

33:11.389 --> 33:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Radiation exposure data captured
by the dosimeters
routinely worn by these workers
over the years

33:16.962 --> 33:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is compared with their health
history and
cause of death.

33:20.298 --> 33:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BOICE: So, when we complete
this study,
that we will be able to say what
the risks

33:25.103 --> 33:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are from these various levels of
radiation.
Are they the same as Hiroshima
and Nagasaki?

33:31.142 --> 33:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are they lower? Are they higher?

33:33.011 --> 33:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Some studies
suggest our bodies
can fight back and repair damage
caused by

33:37.916 --> 33:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
low-level, yet chronic, exposure
to radiation.
But no one is sure.

33:45.423 --> 33:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biophysicist David Brenner is
also hoping
to fill in some of this
uncharted territory.

33:51.096 --> 33:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is director of the Center for
Radiological
Research at Columbia University
Medical Center.

33:55.967 --> 33:58.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BRENNER, Columbia
University Medical
Center: Any level of radiation
can produce

33:58.503 --> 34:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DNA damage, which ultimately can
produce a
cancer.

34:01.973 --> 34:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But when the
doses get very
low, scientists are hard-pressed
to quantify

34:07.345 --> 34:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the link between radiation and
cancer. There
is just too much cancer out
there already.

34:12.651 --> 34:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four in 10 Americans will
eventually battle
the disease anyway.

34:16.755 --> 34:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRENNER: So how do you
detect a very
small increase in that 40
percent? And if

34:21.593 --> 34:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was an increase from 40
percent to 40.1
percent, how would we ever
detect that? And

34:28.233 --> 34:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's really our problem.

34:29.634 --> 34:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So could there be
a line below
which there is no risk?

34:33.271 --> 34:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRENNER: But what we're
trying to do
is to figure out, what is the
best way to

34:39.177 --> 34:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extrapolate the risks that we
know from high
doses to low doses? In order to
do that, we

34:45.583 --> 34:51.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really want to know the
mechanism on how exactly
does radiation produce cancer.

MILES O'BRIEN: Brenner employs a
particle
accelerator to try and find some
answers.

In experiments, he aims

35:00.966 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRENNER: What we want to
do is to be
able to expose a cell to
radiation, but not

35:06.104 --> 35:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expose all the neighbor cells to
radiation,
because that's actually what --
the real-life

35:11.443 --> 35:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation at very, very low
doses.

35:13.578 --> 35:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This isn't just
an academic
pursuit. The atomic bomb
survivors study is

35:18.350 --> 35:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the basis of risk estimates for
everything
from doses in medical care, to
work rules

35:23.488 --> 35:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for radiation workers, to
evacuation orders
in the wake of a nuclear power
plant meltdown.

35:29.127 --> 35:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these rules, which can
affect so many
lives in so many devastating
ways, are based

35:34.666 --> 35:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solely on educated guesswork. In
January 2015,
the U.S. House passed the
low-dose radiation

35:42.140 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill which would provide funds
to begin a
large study. But the bill
stalled in the Senate,

35:47.812 --> 35:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustrating scientists who
believe the nation
that unleashed the nuclear age
is obligated

35:53.051 --> 35:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to never stop trying to fully
comprehend its
long-term impact.

HARI SREENIVASAN: In October
2015 an American
AC-130 gunship pummeled the
Doctors Without

36:21.579 --> 36:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Borders hospital in Kunduz,
Afghanistan, hitting
what the crew believed to be a
Taliban fighting

36:27.085 --> 36:28.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane rained artillery and
other fire
on the facility, killing 42
people, despite

36:32.590 --> 36:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frantic calls from the group,
known by its
French acronym, MSF, to stop the
attack.

36:38.063 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last month, an Army
investigation found there
was no intent by the Americans
to destroy

36:42.901 --> 36:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hospital, either by the air
crew or the
American special forces on the
ground who

36:48.673 --> 36:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were calling in for fire. The
probe found
that it was a targeting error
born of confusion

36:54.779 --> 36:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and miscommunication in the fog
of war.

36:57.882 --> 37:02.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Sixteen soldiers were
reprimanded, but no
criminal charges were filed.

37:02.554 --> 37:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a new report in "The New
York Times" magazine
by Matthieu Aikins of the Nation
Institute

37:07.158 --> 37:13.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
casts doubt on the motivations
of the Afghan
troops who told the Americans
that the hospital

37:13.665 --> 37:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was a Taliban stronghold.

37:15.366 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with Aikins yesterday
and with two
former military attorneys.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking the reporter
what may have
motivated this attack.

37:23.641 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS, The Nation
Institute: From
the extensive reporting that we
did starting

37:27.178 --> 37:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from November, as well as
documents that are
buried in the military's
redacted report,

37:33.218 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's evidence that Afghan
forces may have
provided an exact description
that matched

37:38.756 --> 37:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hospital as a target,
meaning that they
intentionally targeted the
hospital, leading

37:44.629 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to U.S. forces perhaps
unintentionally striking
the hospital as a result of that
description.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, why would
Afghan forces
want to strike a hospital?

37:52.470 --> 37:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: There's been a
long-simmering
tension between MSF and the
Afghan government,

37:58.743 --> 38:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically a collision between
two different
world views, MSF, which sees
itself as a neutral

38:03.381 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
humanitarian medical
organization that treats
all sides to a conflict,
regardless of who

38:08.186 --> 38:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are, and Afghan forces that
have resented
MSF treating what it views as
its enemy.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So is there a
widespread
mistrust?

38:16.294 --> 38:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: What we found,
you know,
when I went to Kunduz, was a
resentment and

38:21.533 --> 38:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a mistrust of MSF on the part of
the Afghan
forces. They told me they
thought that MSF

38:26.271 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was supporting the Taliban.

38:28.173 --> 38:32.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this, you know, later led to
what turned
out to be false beliefs that MSF
actually

38:32.777 --> 38:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been taken over and there
were Taliban
leadership inside the hospital
at the time

38:36.014 --> 38:37.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it was struck.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have read
the official
military account. You have done
your own reporting.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are there discrepancies?

38:43.555 --> 38:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: I think that
what's unexplained
in the military's report, what
they elide

38:47.358 --> 38:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the report is that the
AC-130, the gunship
that struck the hospital, after
its navigation

38:53.298 --> 38:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systems failed, it then relied
on a visual
description of the target that
was given by

38:59.571 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the special forces ground
commander.

39:01.606 --> 39:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that description, as the
military admits,
came from the Afghan forces. The
military

39:06.811 --> 39:09.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically asked the Afghan
forces what they
wanted to hit.

39:09.614 --> 39:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while the coordinates for
the other target,
you know, the intelligence
headquarters, were

39:15.386 --> 39:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed on, those were correct
coordinates,
they were passed on much earlier
in the evening,

39:20.258 --> 39:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around 6:00 p.m., according to
the military,
so that 1:00 a.m., an hour
before the strike,

39:22.393 --> 39:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the military goes back, and
there is
some confusion because of this
failure of

39:26.197 --> 39:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the navigation system, and they
ask the Afghan
forces, what should we be
hitting here, the

39:29.801 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Afghan forces pass up a
description that distinctly
resembled the MSF hospital and
in no way resembled

39:36.741 --> 39:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the intelligence headquarters.

39:38.643 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, according
to the MSF,
they call it -- they describe it
as an uncontrolled

39:43.781 --> 39:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operation in a crowded area. Is
there evidence
of that?

39:47.552 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: Yes, I think
this is a very
crowded city. It's Afghanistan's
fifth largest

39:51.890 --> 39:53.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

39:53.725 --> 39:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that they're
blindly striking
essentially a target in a
crowded area raises

39:58.296 --> 40:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions of recklessness and
negligence.
But we actually go further than
that and suggest

40:02.867 --> 40:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Afghan forces may have
intended to
deliberately target the
hospital.

40:06.571 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You also cite
different
correspondences that members of
the military

40:10.508 --> 40:14.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who were involved in the
operation had with
members of Congress or others.
What was their

40:14.679 --> 40:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
view on what was happening at
the time, and
did that change after the fact?

40:19.183 --> 40:20.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: Well,
absolutely.

40:20.952 --> 40:24.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were provided with an e-mail
from one of
the special forces troopers on
the ground

40:25.023 --> 40:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who said that, you know, there
were Taliban
inside. They had kidnapped the
doctors, and

40:30.595 --> 40:34.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they had taken it over,
basically suggesting
that the American forces on the
ground had

40:34.932 --> 40:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come to believe the false
reports that, you
know, Afghan forces told me they
believed,

40:39.170 --> 40:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they provided to American
forces, that
the hospital had been taken over
by the Taliban,

40:43.308 --> 40:45.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is very troubling.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, it's something that
is not really
contained within the military's
report or

40:48.079 --> 40:49.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
addressed by their
investigation.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
members of the
MSF told you at the end of your
story about

40:53.017 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the possibility of ever working
in a place
where so many U.N. Security
Council members

40:58.456 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are involved in active
conflicts.

41:00.425 --> 41:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: Well, you know,
this has
been a trend around the world.
You have had

41:04.128 --> 41:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strikes against MSF facilities
in Syria, in
Yemen, in Sudan, and in other
areas.

41:11.002 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that MSF is being
targeted is an
extremely worrying development
and one that,

41:16.307 --> 41:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, has been taken to the
Security Council.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matthieu
Aikins joining
us from Athens, thanks so much.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHIEU AIKINS: My pleasure.

41:22.647 --> 41:26.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We take a
deeper look at
the U.S. military's
investigation of the attack

41:26.551 --> 41:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Doctors Without Borders
hospital in
Kunduz and whether the probe
should have gone

41:30.855 --> 41:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
further with retired Marine
Corps Lieutenant
Colonel Gary Solis. He served as
a company

41:35.059 --> 41:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commander in Vietnam and later
as a judge
advocate and military judge
during his 26-year

41:40.498 --> 41:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career. He now teaches the law
of armed conflict
at Georgetown University.

41:45.069 --> 41:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And retired Lieutenant Colonel
Jeffrey Addicott
spent 20 years as judge advocate
in the Army

41:49.707 --> 41:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, for part of that time,
served as a senior
legal adviser to special forces.
He is the

41:55.179 --> 41:59.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director of the Center for
Terrorism Law at
St. Mary's University School of
Law in San

41:59.917 --> 42:00.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Antonio.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gary Solis, I want to start with
you.

42:02.520 --> 42:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military admits a series of
cascading
errors that led to this tragedy.
What was

42:07.458 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the most egregious to you?

42:09.327 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
To me, the most egregious was
that the pilot

42:11.629 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was unsure of his target for an
hour as he
circled overhead, and that he
later fired,

42:19.003 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despite not -- apparently not
being all that
sure of his target.

42:24.308 --> 42:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even two minutes after he
initiated the first
volley, he radioed JTAC on the
ground asking

42:31.215 --> 42:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for confirmation that he had hit
the target.
He still was unsure that he had
hit the correct

42:35.553 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
target, and, to me, that's the
most egregious
of a series of errors that were
made.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Addicott, your response?

42:41.292 --> 42:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT (RET).
U.S. Army:
It's 2:00 in the morning, the
fog of war.

42:45.396 --> 42:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, the report found that
there was no
intentional conduct on the part
of the American

42:51.869 --> 42:57.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces. So, yes, it was a
tragedy. It's a
horrible tragedy, and it
shouldn't have happened,

42:57.341 --> 42:59.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it did happen.

42:59.143 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our toolbox is not Anglo-Saxon
criminal law.
It's the law of war that we look
at when we

43:03.014 --> 43:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judge these types of things.

43:04.849 --> 43:07.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Addicott, staying
with you for a second, there
seems to be a

43:07.752 --> 43:14.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distinction between intent and
negligence.
Just because you are not
intending to do something,

43:14.292 --> 43:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does that let you off the hook
from being
negligent in trying to do your
best not to

43:18.329 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get something wrong?

43:20.131 --> 43:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: Well,
it doesn't
let you off the hook, but we're
talking about

43:22.166 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether there's a grave breach
of the law
of war, which has a different
set of requirement

43:25.837 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
than, for example, other
breaches of the law
of war, simple breaches.

43:29.841 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't see a gray breach of the
law of war,
primarily because, yes, mistakes
were made,

43:34.879 --> 43:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communication breakdown. And if
it's true
that we had faulty intelligence
from the Afghans,

43:39.350 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the investigation should be
reopened.
But that still wouldn't, you
know, alleviate

43:45.790 --> 43:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the report here that we have
indicating no
intent on the part of the
Americans to target

43:51.863 --> 43:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this particular facility.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gary Solis, I
saw you shaking
your head a couple of times
there. If you

43:55.800 --> 43:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were prosecuting this, how would
you do it?

43:57.535 --> 44:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS: There is
negligence,
and then there is culpable
negligence.

44:01.038 --> 44:07.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In other words, if the
negligence is so significant
that it becomes more than mere
simple negligence,

44:07.545 --> 44:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you have a prosecutable
case. But, to
my mind, the fact that he fired
anyway, despite

44:13.451 --> 44:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that he had lost his
guidance system,
that his aircraft navigation
system had previously

44:17.755 --> 44:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gone down, that his video
antenna was gone,
that he was unsure of the
target, those things

44:22.360 --> 44:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
combined, to me, raise a
colorable case of
culpable negligence, which in my
mind should

44:29.033 --> 44:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been decided by a military
jury.

44:31.569 --> 44:35.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Jeffrey
Addicott, why
not a military jury? Why not a
courts-martial,

44:35.439 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instead of the legal process
that took place?

44:37.208 --> 44:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: I
don't think it's
necessary.

44:39.176 --> 44:45.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had three generals from
outside the theater
come in. We had interviews by 65
witnesses,

44:45.683 --> 44:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
3,000 pages of investigation.
Lots of judge
advocates higher in rank than
Gary and myself

44:50.521 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looked this thing over, mulled
it over. And
I think they came up with the
right conclusion,

44:54.158 --> 44:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no intent and, therefore, you
know they decided
to handle it at a lower level,
which is in

44:59.964 --> 45:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
accordance with the law of war.

45:00.831 --> 45:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not going to second-guess
them.

45:02.900 --> 45:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gary Solis,
did this investigation
do the best that it could? The
MSF says, listen,

45:07.805 --> 45:11.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we wanted an outside
investigation. It doesn't
make sense for the very people
who committed

45:11.776 --> 45:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the crime to be investigating
it.

45:13.644 --> 45:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS: I don't
argue that it
didn't do the best -- the
investigator didn't

45:18.049 --> 45:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do the best that he could.

45:19.784 --> 45:26.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I simply disagree with his
conclusion. And
that is that, in this situation,
given the

45:26.123 --> 45:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances of which the
aircraft commander
and his sensor operator were
aware, they went

45:32.029 --> 45:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead and fired on a target of
which they
were not sure.

45:36.801 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Addicott, why not?
Why not have a jury take a look
at this?

45:41.606 --> 45:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: The
moment of absolute
certainty in combat never
arises.

45:45.009 --> 45:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're going to wait and hold
that standard
to soldiers, we're just going to
sit in a

45:48.479 --> 45:52.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foxhole and never shoot, because
I'm not quite
sure that I have got the right
thing. The

45:52.183 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law of war doesn't require that.
And if it
did, we might as well just pack
our bags and

45:55.920 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leave now.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gary Solis,
what about that
idea, that, basically, that,
unfortunately,

46:00.458 --> 46:02.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can't have a judge authorize
every bullet
fired?

46:02.593 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS: I have been
in combat.
I have called in supporting
fires from AC-130s.

46:07.732 --> 46:13.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're never positive, but
the law doesn't
require that you be positive.
And it does

46:13.571 --> 46:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allow for negligence, in which
case, if it
was simple negligence, I would
agree. But

46:18.042 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I simply believe that, given the
series of
mechanical failures in the
aircraft, and the

46:25.249 --> 46:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indecision of the pilot even
before, even
after he fired indicate culpable
negligence.

46:33.190 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: I
would agree if
the building was marked, but the
building

46:35.826 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't marked. These people
didn't mark that
facility, and we can't expect
these people

46:40.498 --> 46:44.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do the Monday-morning
quarterback, look
over their shoulder, be
hypersensitive about

46:44.635 --> 46:46.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

46:46.370 --> 46:48.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their obligation was to mark the
building.
I'm using my military language,
but there

46:48.606 --> 46:53.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was no marks, no red crescent on
there. We
can't hold our soldiers to this
supercilious

46:53.978 --> 46:55.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standard.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Addicott, the MSF
is going to say, listen, or they
have said,

46:57.948 --> 47:02.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we gave you, the military, the
GPS coordinates.
We gave it to you a few days
before. We gave

47:02.253 --> 47:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to you just a couple of days
before. What
else could we possibly do? And
we were actually

47:07.091 --> 47:08.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flying a flag?

47:08.826 --> 47:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, it was 2:00 in the morning.
And we're
the only ones with the lights on
in a city

47:11.062 --> 47:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has no power. What else
could the MSF
have done to protect themselves
in this case?

47:16.667 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: Have
a reflective
device that's on the roof that
has the red

47:20.037 --> 47:22.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crescent onto it. I mean, they
could do that.
They didn't do it.

47:22.373 --> 47:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Gary
Solis, what about
the idea that we heard from the
reporter that

47:25.509 --> 47:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there might be ape different
motive behind
this, that the Afghan forces
that were there

47:29.747 --> 47:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this kind of mistrust, and
they might
think that, hey, you know what,
this is a

47:33.084 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place where they actually are
harboring Taliban
leadership, and this should be a
fair place

47:37.288 --> 47:38.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for us to go after?

47:38.956 --> 47:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS: I think the
report by
Matthieu Aikins, if it proves to
be true,

47:43.894 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could provide evidence that
shows that the
indecision was mere negligence.
In other words,

47:50.601 --> 47:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was excusable, given the
circumstances.

47:52.737 --> 47:59.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, so far, what we know is
what he did and
what he reported -- that he, the
pilot, reported

47:59.410 --> 48:03.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the investigation, which, of
course, I
have not read; 3,000-pages long,
I don't know

48:03.080 --> 48:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if it's even been released in
full to the
public.

48:06.183 --> 48:13.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, I think that that
report could provide
evidence on behalf of the pilot
and the sensor

48:13.591 --> 48:14.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
operator on the plane.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Addicott, what about
that?

48:16.727 --> 48:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT:
Real-time information
on the ground that this is the
target, I mean,

48:20.064 --> 48:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously, the person that is
providing that
false information needs to be
prosecuted.

48:24.301 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that overrides. Then the
pilot could say,
well, I have certain information
from the

48:29.573 --> 48:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground, and I'm assuming that
they're our
allies, and I'm assuming it's
correct information.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm going to go ahead and
target and fire.

48:35.646 --> 48:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jeffrey Addicott,
Gary Solis, thank you, both.

48:41.118 --> 48:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LT. COL. JEFFREY ADDICOTT: Thank
you.

48:45.422 --> 48:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LT. COL. GARY SOLIS: Thank you.

48:49.693 --> 48:53.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, a
"NewsHour" Essay.

48:53.998 --> 49:00.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biologist Sheila Patek has faced
criticism
for her research on mantis
shrimp and trap-jaw

49:00.704 --> 49:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ants. In recent months, members
of Congress
have called her studies a waste
of taxpayer

49:06.210 --> 49:08.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

49:08.045 --> 49:12.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she explains how
dismissing her work
misses the aim of scientific
research and

49:12.950 --> 49:14.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discovery.

49:14.718 --> 49:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEILA PATEK, Biologist: Some
years ago, I
presented my lab's discoveries
to a group

49:17.521 --> 49:20.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of leading thinkers and public
figures.

49:20.291 --> 49:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We discovered that mantis shrimp
use hammers
equivalent to the mass of two
toothpicks and

49:24.862 --> 49:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move them with the acceleration
of a bullet
to pulverize thick snail shells.
We discovered

49:30.100 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that tiny trap-jaw ants close
their jaws with
100,000 times the acceleration
of a sprinting

49:35.573 --> 49:37.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cheetah.

49:37.341 --> 49:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I expressed the wonder of these
discoveries,
as well as their fundamental
significance

49:41.278 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to physics, evolution, and the
limits of current
engineering capabilities.

49:45.916 --> 49:49.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A prominent lawyer from Nigeria
who was in
the audience that day approached
me a few

49:50.020 --> 49:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days later. Her first words to
me were, "Your
research disgusted me with such
waste, studying

49:57.928 --> 50:00.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trivial and useless problems."

50:00.698 --> 50:05.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that moment, she had voiced
my most vulnerable
thoughts: that the science to
which I would

50:05.769 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dedicated much of my life was
actually pointless.

50:08.606 --> 50:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she added, "I realized
something important,
that science is about discovery,
not just

50:14.745 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about solving human problems."

50:17.281 --> 50:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She then spoke a phrase that has
stuck with
me over the years. She said, "I
want what

50:22.887 --> 50:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you have for my country."

50:25.923 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her country, Nigeria, there
was simply
no infrastructure for this type
of discovery-based

50:30.661 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
research. In fact, many
solutions to humans'
problems began in a scientist's
laboratory.

50:37.034 --> 50:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you know that some of the
most significant
medical breakthroughs for the
human brain

50:41.772 --> 50:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began with research on sea
slugs?

50:45.309 --> 50:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The value of my work came under
attack again
when Republican Senator Jeff
Flake featured

50:50.681 --> 50:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it in a Wastebook. That's a
partisan report
that highlights what some in
Congress see

50:55.786 --> 51:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as wasteful government spending.
They ridiculed
a research project in my lab
that showed how

51:02.026 --> 51:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mantis shrimp use their lethal
weapons to
resolve conflicts without
killing each other.

51:07.998 --> 51:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you think about it, this
is a fundamental
question for any animal or human
system that

51:13.103 --> 51:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has lethal capabilities. In
response to the
Wastebook attack, I was invited
to present

51:18.342 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my research on Capitol Hill.

51:20.778 --> 51:26.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Flake came to the event,
and I spoke
to him one on one. I told him
the story of

51:26.116 --> 51:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the many unanticipated
paths from my
lab's discoveries to human
applications. I

51:32.356 --> 51:37.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
explained how the
extraordinarily intense
impacts of mantis shrimp hammers
inspired

51:37.127 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
engineers to make new materials.

51:39.063 --> 51:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, this might result in
lightweight,
impact-resistant sports helmets
and military

51:45.002 --> 51:52.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
armor. He actually seemed
engaged. So, I asked
him, "Did any of my research
seem worthwhile?"

51:52.876 --> 51:58.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Flake said yes. He was
especially
interested in the novel
engineering products.

These fundamental discoveries
and their potential
for translation are why my
research program

52:02.953 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is funded by the Department of
Defense and
the National Science Foundation.
However,

52:08.425 --> 52:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engineering-related applications
are not the
primary reason we do this
research.

52:12.596 --> 52:18.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nature of discovery is that
it is impossible
to anticipate what you will
find. That is

52:18.936 --> 52:24.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovery. Discovery-based
research is most
fruitful when new knowledge is
sought for

52:24.575 --> 52:29.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its own sake.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: New clues to the Earth's
early atmosphere

52:42.159 --> 52:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may be trapped in fossilized
bubbles in ancient
lava. And scientists say the
findings could

52:48.632 --> 52:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
redefine our search for life
beyond Earth.
