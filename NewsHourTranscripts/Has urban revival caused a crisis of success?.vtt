sword of urban revival even
if some cities are becoming

00:06.800 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever more popular and
desirable they're also becoming
places where the middle

economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the story it's
part of his weekly series

00:18.866 --> 00:21.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
making sense

00:23.500 --> 00:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking down on
Manhattan's old meatpacking
district the High Line a

00:26.466 --> 00:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mecca for more than 7
million eager tourists a
year astride a once derelict

00:33.433 --> 00:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spur of the New York Central
this was an old broken-down
abandoned rail line

00:36.733 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elevated rail line a rail
line shrouding the buildings
beneath as a result rents

00:43.700 --> 00:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were cheap in the cutting
edge marginalized moved
in much of this area

00:46.066 --> 00:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Chelsea was historically
a gay neighborhood and
they were gay men and

00:49.800 --> 00:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wanted to do something
which celebrated the the
history of the old gay

00:56.633 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
neighborhood noted urban
ologist Richard Florida there's
one of the old buildings

00:59.700 --> 01:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still with the rainbow
flag a remnant of the past
that proved a harbinger of

01:06.666 --> 01:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gentrification to come
once they built the park it
became a draw not us people

01:09.533 --> 01:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but for real estate
developers and they never
anticipated that no one

01:12.766 --> 01:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anticipated the High Line
would be a place that
luxury towers would grow up

01:19.733 --> 01:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around but have they ever
for nearly a mile and a half
the elevated walkway now

01:24.833 --> 01:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winds through towers full
of luxury condos over
the top testimony to the

01:30.066 --> 01:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urban revitalization that
Florida famously championed
in his 2002 book the

01:35.733 --> 01:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creative class we're
going through I think one
of the greatest economic

01:37.966 --> 01:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transformations in history
from an old industrial ii
corporate based vertical

01:42.300 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy to a new knowledge
economy but the twist i
try to add is it's also

01:46.100 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urban its its city based
its clustered in cities
florida's twist became gospel

01:53.066 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attract members of the
creative class and they in
turn will create jobs which

01:58.400 --> 02:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will in turn renew and
rebuild and it happened just
look at the High Line but

02:03.933 --> 02:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Florida now sees is the
double edge of the advice
he gave and that so many

02:09.666 --> 02:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed a bigger denser
city in general increases
the rate of innovation

02:12.166 --> 02:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
increases the rate
of star increases the
rate of productivity at

02:16.333 --> 02:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same time the bigger the
denser the more knowledge
intensive increases the

02:19.800 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate of inequality increases
the rate of economic
segregation makes housing less

02:23.633 --> 02:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable so it's a two
sided monster those unintended
consequences of urban

02:28.066 --> 02:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revival are the real world
twist Florida wrestles with
in his latest book the new

02:34.966 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urban crisis people want
to park money in real
estate artists the best art

02:37.733 --> 02:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
galleries in the world
commercial companies real
estate development firms

02:41.866 --> 02:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
financial headquarters
heck companies startups and
companies like Google so

02:46.366 --> 02:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the second dimension is I
kind of call it a crisis
of success these places now

02:50.766 --> 02:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
become terribly unaffordable
for anyone who's not either
a knowledge worker or a

02:57.666 --> 03:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
techie or a member of the
super rich as a result
pressure on most of the city's

03:03.233 --> 03:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
residents now facing apartment
rents and prices soaring
as high as the buildings

03:08.600 --> 03:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that house them many actually
unoccupied because they
are assets for foreigners

03:13.766 --> 03:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parking their money as
Florida puts it in real estate
you stop stocks you stop

03:17.033 --> 03:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bonds now owning real
estate in a superstar city
becomes another class of

03:21.500 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asset rents in this building
roughly thirty five hundred
dollars a month for

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a one-room studio apartment
forty-seven hundred for a
one-bedroom seven thousand

03:32.933 --> 03:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for two bedrooms I could not
live in a decent Manhattan
apartment by myself I

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be able to live in
Queens or maybe outer skirts
of Brooklyn these days

03:43.866 --> 03:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it's gotten very
expensive there to sarah
hawk rad a 31 year old speech

03:46.633 --> 03:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therapist who works nearby
lives across town with
roommates was hoping to move

03:51.600 --> 03:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somewhere close with her
boyfriend how much money
would you and he have to earn

03:55.933 --> 04:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just to get to be able to
afford a $4,700 a month
apartment maybe 150 170

04:03.100 --> 04:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like and that's to really
cut down into the bare bones
of what how you live at

04:07.833 --> 04:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year
it was testimony like

04:12.333 --> 04:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this that triggered Florida's
aha moment the gradual
displacement of all but the

04:19.300 --> 04:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most successful types
he long urged cities to
attract we did an analysis

04:22.566 --> 04:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which looked at the amount
of money these three
groups the knowledge

04:25.666 --> 04:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creative class but working
blue-collar class and the

04:28.866 --> 04:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service workers had left
over after paying for
housing the creatives had

04:32.366 --> 04:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like 80 or 90 grand left
over the blue collars had
30 and the service workers

04:36.366 --> 04:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had like 15 I realized
that this urbanism
winner-take-all urbanism it was

04:43.266 --> 04:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefiting one group much
more disproportionately
than the other two

04:45.266 --> 04:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and with ballooning rents
low-income workers are
being squeezed out entirely

04:51.900 --> 04:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banished to the once desirable
suburbs it's a crisis
that's metastasizing of

04:57.066 --> 04:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poverty concentrated
poverty economic distress
in our suburbs it's been

04:59.500 --> 05:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening for decades
of course the inexorable
pinching of America's middle

05:04.066 --> 05:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class the move towards
what's been called an
hourglass economy with the

05:11.033 --> 05:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosperous in the top
half the less well-off in
the bottom and fewer and

05:14.433 --> 05:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fewer Americans in between
if the old urban crisis
was about the middle class

05:18.666 --> 05:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flight from the city to the
suburbs yes the new urban
crisis is about really the

05:23.166 --> 05:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disappearance of
middle-class neighborhoods
from our society what

05:26.433 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tragic about that is the
middle-class neighborhoods
were really our launch

05:29.733 --> 05:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pads for upward mobility
in the American dream thus
Florida's first epiphany the

05:34.200 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing divide within cities
between the rich and the
rest who are being forced

05:39.200 --> 05:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of town though we
also had a second insight
that divide between cities

05:46.233 --> 05:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winner-take-all urbanism
the winners San Francisco
New York the losers cities

05:51.733 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Detroit Milwaukee
Memphis and even in these
stressed cities creative class

05:58.300 --> 06:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clustering is beginning to
segregate the rich from the
rest but wait a second the

06:04.166 --> 06:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winning cities simply
followed Florida's own advice
suggesting a pointed question

06:09.400 --> 06:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what he calls the new
urban crisis did he help
caused it I think I really

06:14.733 --> 06:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to help cities
understand that urban revival
but that urban revival you

06:17.533 --> 06:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know according to the
data we now have it's 2002
now where that the urban

06:24.500 --> 06:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revival goes into full bore
and I think I was not only
surprised shocked by the

06:29.733 --> 06:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speed of it and and shocked
by the way it put pressure
on cities but then what

06:35.900 --> 06:39.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
if anything can
to close the gap

06:44.633 --> 06:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well one answer building
public transit to connect
the lagging outskirts to jobs

06:51.633 --> 06:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the booming urban core
and hey the 34th Street
and Hudson Yards subway

06:55.033 --> 06:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
station just opened in 2015 it's
spectacular

06:58.866 --> 07:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but if you look at most
of the subway stops and
transit hubs Penn Station

07:02.800 --> 07:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're falling apart Penn
Station New York's key
commuter hub is evermore

07:09.766 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
haunted by delays and
cancellations the result of
aging infrastructure but if

07:15.200 --> 07:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you really modernize a
city's transit system
you run back into the

07:18.266 --> 07:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
double-edged sword of
Florida's advice the better
the transit the denser and

07:25.200 --> 07:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more productive the city the
less its lower end workers
will be able to afford

07:30.966 --> 07:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to live in it the more of
a rich Enclave it becomes
well yes that may be true

07:35.933 --> 07:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Florida acknowledges and so
he says that today's cities
have to start insisting

07:42.100 --> 07:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you want to build a tower
like that if you want to
get the rights to create

07:45.366 --> 07:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
height and density we're
going to make a trade

07:48.600 --> 07:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a trade we're going
to make and what are you
for you to go up like that

07:51.533 --> 07:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're going to make
affordable housing affordable
housing the only real way to

07:56.433 --> 08:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to close the gap says
Florida so why not muscle
developers to offer workers

08:03.300 --> 08:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their projects cheap
rents good wages why not
have your tenants be the ones

08:09.133 --> 08:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are creating better
higher-paying service jobs
that are creating a family

08:11.100 --> 08:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
supporting job so we
can have an inclusionary
prosperity in cities can

08:14.833 --> 08:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say we'll trade density for
good things that developers
will do in order to get

08:19.833 --> 08:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the density they want the
height they want they've
got to build affordable

08:22.533 --> 08:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing and they've got
to build a more inclusive
community but if they don't

08:26.566 --> 08:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're left with the two
faces of Florida's present
creative class advice

08:31.500 --> 08:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's the great contradiction
of today's urbanized
capitalism you know if

08:35.866 --> 08:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we want to have a productive
city and innovative city
a country that innovates

08:39.500 --> 08:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and creates good jobs we
need them but at the same
time that the very thing

08:43.633 --> 08:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is driving our
economy forward is creating
these divides for the PBS
