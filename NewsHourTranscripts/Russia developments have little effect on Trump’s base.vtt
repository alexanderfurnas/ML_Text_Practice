NEWS POLL SHOWS 60% OF

00:05.333 --> 00:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS BELIEVE RUSSIA TRIED

TRUMP CAMPAIGN INTENTIONALLY

00:11.933 --> 00:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIDED THOSE EFFORTS.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLL ALSO SHOWS PRESIDENT

00:15.100 --> 00:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING HAS

00:15.933 --> 00:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DROPPED TO 36%.

00:17.666 --> 00:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

00:22.333 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DISCUSS THAT AND MORE,

"NEWSHOUR WEEKEND"'S JEFF

00:24.666 --> 00:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREENFIELD IS HERE IN THE

00:25.666 --> 00:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDIO.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF, THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:28.233 --> 00:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HAPPENED SINCE WE HAD THIS

00:31.166 --> 00:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVELATION, DONALD TRUMP JR.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPOSING HIS OWN EMAILS SAYING,

00:33.666 --> 00:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"HERE'S THE MEETING," ETC.,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ETC., HOW DOES THAT PLAY WITH

00:36.166 --> 00:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S BASE?

00:37.600 --> 00:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S AS IF IT DIDN'T MATTER.

00:39.433 --> 00:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS A CONSTANT.

00:40.733 --> 00:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:41.900 --> 00:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST LIKE... IT FEELS LIKE

00:42.766 --> 00:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

00:44.433 --> 00:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT POLL, FEWER THAN ONE IN

00:47.533 --> 00:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEN REPUBLICANS THINK THERE WAS

00:48.866 --> 00:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING BOTHERSOME ABOUT THE

00:50.233 --> 00:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA-TRUMP FAMILY CONNECTIONS.

00:53.266 --> 00:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THAT TELLS YOU IS THAT THEY

00:56.466 --> 00:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ACCEPTED TRUMP'S

00:57.766 --> 00:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU

00:59.233 --> 01:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE OR READ SOMETHING ABOUT ME

01:00.933 --> 01:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGATIVE ABOUT RUSSIA, IT'S FAKE

01:02.666 --> 01:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY DEFINITION.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS

01:06.500 --> 01:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS THE PRESS HAS MOVED FURTHER

01:08.166 --> 01:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FURTHER TO SAY, "THERE'S

01:09.500 --> 01:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING HERE," WHAT YOU SEE IS

01:11.133 --> 01:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME CONSERVATIVE COLUMNISTS,

01:12.633 --> 01:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SAYING

01:15.133 --> 01:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YEAH, THIS IS SERIOUS."

01:16.500 --> 01:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY NEVER WERE FOR TRUMP

01:17.633 --> 01:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT HANNITY, "FOX

01:20.000 --> 01:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FRIENDS," AND BREITBART,

01:21.600 --> 01:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT POLL NUMBER, WHAT

01:24.066 --> 01:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE IS AMONG TRUMP'S REAL

01:25.600 --> 01:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS, THEY JUST AREN'T

01:26.633 --> 01:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUYING THAT ANYTHING HAPPENED

01:27.900 --> 01:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: CAN ANYTHING

01:30.100 --> 01:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THAT?

01:31.566 --> 01:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, IN A NORMAL WORLD,

01:32.733 --> 01:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A NORMAL POLITICAL WORLD I'D

01:34.033 --> 01:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE KIND OF CONFIDENT SAYING,

01:35.300 --> 01:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YEAH, IF THE REPUBLICANS IN

01:37.300 --> 01:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS BEGIN TO REALLY GET

01:38.533 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUGH ON TRUMP, SAY, "WHAT'S

01:39.866 --> 01:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON HERE?

01:40.666 --> 01:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE REALLY BOTHERED BY THIS.

01:41.900 --> 01:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A HOSTILE FOREIGN

01:42.900 --> 01:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER, WHAT'S GOING ON?"

01:44.133 --> 01:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT

01:45.333 --> 01:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG THE BASE.

01:46.466 --> 01:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONE OF THE CURIOUS THINGS

01:47.800 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT AMONG

01:49.633 --> 01:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, THEY'RE NOT

01:51.266 --> 01:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THAT HAPPY WITH THE

01:52.466 --> 01:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ANYWAY.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE DECLINING POLL NUMBERS

01:57.233 --> 01:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT REPUBLICANS THINK OF

01:58.600 --> 02:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

02:00.200 --> 02:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERS, YOU'VE SEEN SOME

02:01.700 --> 02:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY SHARP ATTACKS ON THE

02:03.000 --> 02:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF BREITBART AND SOME OF

02:04.266 --> 02:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RADIO PERSONALITIES LIKE

02:06.066 --> 02:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSH LIMBAUGH AND SEAN HANNITY,

02:07.366 --> 02:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING, "YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS

02:09.000 --> 02:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T FIGHTING HARD ENOUGH, YOU

02:10.766 --> 02:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT BE RAISING TAXES ON US,"

02:12.633 --> 02:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE NOT BLAMING TRUMP.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF THE REPUBLICANS BEGIN TO

02:17.233 --> 02:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY IN CONGRESS, "THIS RUSSIA

02:18.633 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING IS BOTHERING US," I'M NOT

02:20.533 --> 02:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE THAT TRUMP PEOPLE ARE GOING

02:22.100 --> 02:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TAKE THAT AS AN OCCASION TO

02:23.433 --> 02:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE THE RESERVATION.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S TALK A

02:26.766 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HEALTH CARE,

02:27.900 --> 02:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS IN THE NEWS TODAY.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE

02:30.233 --> 02:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSTPONED AT LEAST ANOTHER

02:31.266 --> 02:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF IT DOESN'T COME UP FOR A

VOTE, OR IF IT COMES UP FOR A

02:35.166 --> 02:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE AND DOESN'T PASS, ANY

02:36.266 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PRESIDENT?

02:37.500 --> 02:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FOR TRUMP?

02:38.933 --> 02:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE PREVIOUS ANSWER.

02:41.033 --> 02:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE NON-TRUMP UNIVERSE, IF

02:42.833 --> 02:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PRESIDENT RUNS ON A KEY

02:44.633 --> 02:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMISE-- "I'M GOING TO REPEAL

02:45.700 --> 02:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REPLACE THIS TERRIBLE LAW"

02:47.566 --> 02:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT FAILS, IT WOULD CLOBBER

02:50.333 --> 02:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM.

02:51.466 --> 02:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO CLINTON.

02:52.766 --> 02:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HIS HEALTH CARE PLAN

02:53.933 --> 02:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAILED, A YEAR LATER THEY LOST

02:55.333 --> 02:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONGRESS, THE DEMOCRATS.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONCE AGAIN, AND THIS ONE, I

02:58.566 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, IS REALLY SOMETHING WE'VE

03:00.266 --> 03:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE

03:02.500 --> 03:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT SEEN AS A

03:04.100 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVE MASTER, NOT KEEN ON

03:06.933 --> 03:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DETAILS, IN FACT WE'VE HAD

03:08.266 --> 03:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS IN MEDIA KIND OF

03:10.500 --> 03:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITE IN SAYING HE DOESN'T

03:11.800 --> 03:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW MUCH OR CARE MUCH WHAT'S

03:13.566 --> 03:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE BILL.

03:14.666 --> 03:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS SAID GIVE ME SOMETHING

03:15.733 --> 03:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'LL SIGN IT.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF IT WERE TO FAIL, WHO DO

03:18.833 --> 03:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP FOLKS BLAME?

03:20.866 --> 03:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT OR DO THEY BLAME

03:22.100 --> 03:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP?

03:23.533 --> 03:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE FALLOUT

03:24.700 --> 03:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL HAPPEN.

03:25.833 --> 03:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: JEFF

03:26.733 --> 03:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREENFIELD, THANKS SO MUCH.

03:27.466 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OKAY.
