JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

00:02.966 --> 00:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

00:04.933 --> 00:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from legendary
talk show host Dick Cavett,
whose in-depth discussions

00:07.433 --> 00:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept American television
audiences entertained and
intellectually engaged
for more than five

00:07.966 --> 00:10.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His latest book is "Brief
Encounters: Conversations, Magic
Moments, and Assorted Hijinks."

DICK CAVETT, Author, "Brief
Encounters: Conversations,
Magic Moments, and
Assorted Hijinks": Somebody

00:14.600 --> 00:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said once, what's the secret
of doing a successful, what's
the Brits call a chat show?

00:16.266 --> 00:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If there is a secret,
it was enunciated by
the great Jack Paar.

00:17.466 --> 00:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said, "Kid, don't
do interviews."

00:19.000 --> 00:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, "Well, what do
I do Jack, read to them?"

00:20.233 --> 00:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said, "Make it
a conversation."

00:22.266 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People ask me, what kind of
show did you decide to do or how
would you describe your show?

00:30.900 --> 00:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have never been able
to come up with an answer for
that, because of the fact that

00:35.000 --> 00:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never had any plan.

00:37.633 --> 00:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I knew was I was being
thrown into and responsible for
90 minutes of live television.

00:44.666 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I had the advantage of
having seen great examples of
what I would be doing by Jack

00:50.966 --> 00:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paar, Merv Griffin, Johnny
Carson, all of whom I wrote for.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY CARSON, "The Tonight
Show": Would you welcome,
please, Mr. Dick Cavett?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:06.100 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK CAVETT: With Johnny, of
course, you could turn him on
in your head, how he will word

01:07.200 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, how many
syllables he will use.

01:09.266 --> 01:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of that comes together to
make you able to write a line
that they can come out and

01:12.200 --> 01:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say and sound like themselves.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will you welcome, please,
Mr. Marlon Brando?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19.100 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DICK CAVETT: I was just
slap-happy delirious to
have Marlon Brando on

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my director admitted later
that he said, when Brando
threw that million-dollar grin

01:28.400 --> 01:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a close-up shot,
I couldn't cut away.

01:33.933 --> 01:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My wife's favorite line from
that show is when I said:

01:35.833 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you happy with the way
"The Godfather" came out?

01:38.966 --> 01:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARLON BRANDO, Actor: I would
rather not talk about movies.

01:42.166 --> 01:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think they're...

01:43.433 --> 01:45.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:45.466 --> 01:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK CAVETT: I had the luck
of meeting and sitting with
Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis,

01:51.333 --> 01:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orson Welles, Fred Astaire,
Groucho Marx, Alfred Hitchcock,
Robert Mitchum, oh, and

01:57.100 --> 01:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the great John Huston.

01:59.600 --> 02:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody semi-humorously warned
me, "You're becoming the poster
boy for depression," because

02:06.600 --> 02:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would -- chose to talk about
it, because I found that,
when I did, it helped people.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did shows with it, a thing
that is an ungodly task, as you
stand there sing merrily with

02:19.300 --> 02:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ethel Merman, and you
feel like roadkill.

02:22.466 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And people will say to
Robin Williams, you have

02:32.133 --> 02:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the thrill of going out
on stage and getting
an audience screaming
with happiness in their

02:37.633 --> 02:39.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, incidentally, I saw Robin
come off one night after doing
that and saying: "I could

02:42.700 --> 02:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make those people happy.

02:44.066 --> 02:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why can't I make
myself that happy?"

02:47.566 --> 02:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's central to the problem.

02:50.433 --> 02:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people ask me, who's doing
what you did, or is there a
show that is similar to what

02:57.500 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you were doing, I don't think
there's anything exactly like
it, partly because it's just

03:03.000 --> 03:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - the medium
has changed a lot.

03:05.066 --> 03:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I might be more like parts
of Jon Stewart and certainly
parts of Stephen Colbert.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But people tell me
nothing is quite like it.

03:14.333 --> 03:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wish somebody would tell
me exactly what they mean.

03:18.466 --> 03:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Dick Cavett, and
this is my, how shall I say,
Brief But Spectacular take on

03:28.500 --> 03:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my life and
conversation, I guess.

03:32.300 --> 03:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a life
and a walk down memory lane.
