00:11.511 --> 00:13.247
FOR SATURDAY, JULY 11:

00:13.247 --> 00:14.648
MORE AUSTERITY IN GREECE'S

00:14.648 --> 00:15.682
FUTURE.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.551
A STOCK MARKET CRASH IN CHINA.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.286
TO PUERTO RICO'S SEVERE DEBT

00:19.286 --> 00:21.088
PROBLEM: EXAMINING THREE

00:21.088 --> 00:23.190
CRITICAL FINANCIAL CRISES.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.092
AND, HARPER LEE TAKES THE

00:25.092 --> 00:27.427
LITERARY WORLD BY STORM AGAIN.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.395
A LOOK AT "TO KILL A

00:28.395 --> 00:29.863
MOCKINGBIRD," AND THE SURPRISES

00:29.863 --> 00:31.298
CONTAINED IN "GO SET A

00:31.298 --> 00:32.232
WATCHMAN."

00:32.232 --> 00:33.867
>> I ASKED HER, "DID YOU EVER

00:33.867 --> 00:35.135
THINK YOU WOULD SEE THIS

00:35.135 --> 00:36.403
PUBLISHED?"

00:36.403 --> 00:38.138
AND SHE SAID, "DON'T BE SILLY,

00:38.138 --> 00:39.539
OF COURSE I DID."

00:39.539 --> 00:40.574
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:40.574 --> 00:41.975
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.044
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:44.044 --> 00:45.779
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:45.779 --> 00:47.547
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.415
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:48.415 --> 00:49.316
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.484
WE'RE FOLLOWING THREE SERIOUS,

00:50.484 --> 00:51.952
BUT SEPARATE ECONOMIC CRISES

00:51.952 --> 00:52.953
TONIGHT.

00:52.953 --> 00:53.987
WE START IN GREECE, WHERE

00:53.987 --> 00:55.155
PARLIAMENT HELD A LATE NIGHT

00:55.155 --> 00:56.723
SESSION TO PUT TOGETHER A SERIES

00:56.723 --> 00:58.625
OF BUDGET CUTS IN THE AIMS OF

00:58.625 --> 01:00.193
CONVINCING EUROPEAN LEADERS FOR

01:00.193 --> 01:03.297
53.5 BILLION EUROS IN BAILOUT

01:03.297 --> 01:04.064
FUNDS.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.198
PRIME MINISTER ALEXIS TSIPRAS

01:05.198 --> 01:06.433
NEEDS TO PERSUADE EUROZONE

01:06.433 --> 01:07.768
FINANCE MINISTERS MEETING IN

01:07.768 --> 01:09.169
BRUSSELS TODAY THAT HIS

01:09.169 --> 01:10.637
AUSTERITY PLAN IS WORTHY OF

01:10.637 --> 01:11.772
FURTHER CONSIDERATION BY

01:11.772 --> 01:13.640
EUROPEAN LEADERS TOMORROW.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.042
TSIPRAS IS PROMISING BUDGET CUTS

01:15.042 --> 01:16.810
AND TAX HIKES IN EXCHANGE FOR A

01:16.810 --> 01:18.645
THREE-YEAR LOAN TO KEEP GREECE'S

01:18.645 --> 01:20.547
BANKS FROM COLLAPSING AND KEEP

01:20.547 --> 01:22.716
THE EURO AS ITS COMMON CURRENCY.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.884
LATE TODAY, THE GERMAN FINANCE

01:23.884 --> 01:25.419
MINISTER SUGGESTED GREECE BE

01:25.419 --> 01:26.920
TAKEN OFF THE EURO FOR FIVE

01:26.920 --> 01:29.222
YEARS AND GET HUMANITARIAN AID

01:29.222 --> 01:30.891
INSTEAD OF DEBT RELIEF.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.125
ONE NEGOTIATOR CALLED TODAY'S

01:32.125 --> 01:33.794
MEETING DIFFICULT.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.763
>> WE ARE NOT THERE YET, BOTH ON

01:36.763 --> 01:38.098
SUBSTANCE.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.166
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

01:39.166 --> 01:41.101
CRITICISM ON THE PROPOSALS, ON

01:41.101 --> 01:42.369
THE REFORM SIDE, ON THE FISCAL

01:42.369 --> 01:44.838
SIDE AND THERE IS OF COURSE A

01:44.838 --> 01:46.907
MAJOR ISSUE OF TRUST.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.775
CAN THE GREEK GOVERNMENT BE

01:48.775 --> 01:51.311
TRUSTED TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT THEY

01:51.311 --> 01:52.846
ARE PROMISING, TO ACTUALLY

01:52.846 --> 01:54.481
IMPLEMENT IN THE COMING WEEKS,

01:54.481 --> 01:55.882
MONTHS, YEARS?

01:55.882 --> 01:57.651
>> AFTER ALL, WE ARE DISCUSSING

01:57.651 --> 01:58.986
A PROPOSAL FROM THE GREEK

01:58.986 --> 02:00.721
GOVERNMENT THAT WAS FIERCELY

02:00.721 --> 02:02.789
REJECTED LESS THAN A WEEK AGO,

02:02.789 --> 02:04.224
AND THAT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.258
>> Sreenivasan: DESPITE BACK-TO-

02:05.258 --> 02:06.493
BACK MEETINGS THIS WEEKEND,

02:06.493 --> 02:07.894
NEGOTIATORS DON'T EXPECT TO MAKE

02:07.894 --> 02:09.730
A FINAL DEAL BEFORE MONDAY.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.431
AND IN CHINA, THE GOVERNMENT

02:11.431 --> 02:13.133
MIGHT HAVE STOPPED OR SLOWED-

02:13.133 --> 02:14.868
DOWN THE MASS SELL-OFF THAT

02:14.868 --> 02:16.136
CRASHED IT'S STOCK MARKET THIS

02:16.136 --> 02:16.937
WEEK.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.405
SHARES THERE HAVE FALLEN BY

02:18.405 --> 02:20.073
NEARLY A THIRD IN LESS THAN A

02:20.073 --> 02:21.608
MONTH-- WIPING OUT ALMOST

02:21.608 --> 02:23.844
$4 TRILLION IN WEALTH.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.679
AFTER SERIOUS LOSSES EARLY THIS

02:25.679 --> 02:26.947
WEEK, STOCKS ACTUALLY RALLIED

02:26.947 --> 02:29.383
YESTERDAY AND THURSDAY, POSSIBLY

02:29.383 --> 02:31.485
BECAUSE BEIJING RELEASED

02:31.485 --> 02:33.920
$19 BILLION TO THE COUNTRY'S

02:33.920 --> 02:35.689
BIGGEST BROKERAGE FIRMS.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.391
THE FIRMS ARE USING THE MONEY TO

02:37.391 --> 02:39.026
BUY STOCKS AND SLOW DOWN THE

02:39.026 --> 02:40.127
SELL-OFFS.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.361
SO HOW CONCERNED SHOULD WE BE

02:41.361 --> 02:42.662
ABOUT CHINA'S STOCK CRASH AND

02:42.662 --> 02:44.431
ARE THERE OTHER LOOMING ISSUES

02:44.431 --> 02:46.233
BEYOND THE STOCK MARKET?

02:46.233 --> 02:47.067
JOINING US FROM BOSTON IS

02:47.067 --> 02:48.135
ORVILLE SCHELL, WHO HEADS THE

02:48.135 --> 02:49.970
CENTER ON U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS

02:49.970 --> 02:51.371
AT THE ASIA SOCIETY.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.572
SO ORVILLE, JUST TO KEEP IN

02:52.572 --> 02:53.974
PERSPECTIVE, I WAS LOOKING BACK

02:53.974 --> 02:55.208
AT THE CHARGE, THE TWO MAJOR

02:55.208 --> 02:57.344
INDEXES THERE HAVE DOUBLED, MORE

02:57.344 --> 02:58.812
THAN A HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE

02:58.812 --> 03:00.180
PAST 12 MONTHS.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.149
THAT STILL LEAVES THEM UP 60 OR

03:02.149 --> 03:04.785
70% AND THAT'S A FIGURE MOST OF

03:04.785 --> 03:07.120
US CAN'T WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.922
>> SO THIS WAS REALLY A VERY

03:08.922 --> 03:11.191
OBVIOUS BUBBLE IN THE MAKING.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.994
I THINK IT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR

03:13.994 --> 03:17.364
EVERYBODY TO SEE THIS SPECIFIC

03:17.364 --> 03:18.165
BUBBLE.

03:18.165 --> 03:22.002
WE ARE QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO

03:22.002 --> 03:24.004
FINDING THE ANOMALOUS, THE

03:24.004 --> 03:26.673
EXCEPTIONAL THE UNUSUAL IN

03:26.673 --> 03:28.642
CHINESE ECONOMY AND THESE ARE

03:28.642 --> 03:29.643
CHINESE EXPERIMENTS.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.511
WE NEVER KNOW WHETHER THIS IS

03:31.511 --> 03:34.014
PART OF THE NEW EXTRAORDINARY

03:34.014 --> 03:36.383
INEXPLICABLE CHINESE MODEL,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.318
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING HEADING

03:38.318 --> 03:39.653
FOR THE ABYSS.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.088
IN THIS CASE IT'S HEADED FOR AN

03:41.088 --> 03:42.389
ABYSS.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.657
>> A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THINK

03:43.657 --> 03:45.358
OF THE ECONOMY AND THE STOCK

03:45.358 --> 03:47.394
MARKET IN SYNONYMOUS TERMS BUT

03:47.394 --> 03:48.495
IN CHINA IT'S NOT QUITE THE

03:48.495 --> 03:49.196
CASE.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.163
WHEN IT GOT TOO HOT THE

03:50.163 --> 03:51.164
GOVERNMENT JUMPED IN TO COOL IT

03:51.164 --> 03:52.833
DOWN AND NOW THEY JUMPED IN FOR

03:52.833 --> 03:54.868
THE SELL OFF.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.305
>> AS HUGE AS THE MARKET IS IN

03:58.305 --> 04:00.040
CHINA, IN HONG KONG IT'S THE

04:00.040 --> 04:02.175
SECOND LARGEST STOCK MARKET IN

04:02.175 --> 04:03.944
THE WORLD, STILL IT IS

04:03.944 --> 04:05.812
RELATIVELY DISCRETE IN TERMS OF

04:05.812 --> 04:09.282
ITS CONNECTION TO THE ECONOMY AS

04:09.282 --> 04:10.283
A WHOLE.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.319
I THINK FINALLY ACTUALLY, IT

04:12.319 --> 04:13.587
WILL CERTAINLY HAVE SOME EFFECT

04:13.587 --> 04:15.288
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A DO OR

04:15.288 --> 04:19.459
DIE MATTER FOR CHINA'S ECONOMY

04:19.459 --> 04:20.760
IN GENERAL.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.529
SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.697
I THINK ACTUALLY THE

04:23.697 --> 04:27.200
CONSEQUENCES AS SERIOUS AS THEY

04:27.200 --> 04:29.736
COULD BE IN WAYS FOR THE ECONOMY

04:29.736 --> 04:32.172
WILL BE EVEN GREATER IN THE

04:32.172 --> 04:33.940
POLITICAL SOCIAL REALM.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.810
AND PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO

04:36.810 --> 04:39.379
THE LEADERSHIP SORT OF ABILITY

04:39.379 --> 04:41.114
TO CONTINUE TO EVOKE THE SENSE

04:41.114 --> 04:43.884
OF OMNIPOTENCE.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.752
>> WHAT SORT OF RIPPLE EFFECTS

04:45.752 --> 04:46.720
DO YOU SEE HERE.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.022
IF THERE'S LESS WEALTH IN THE

04:49.022 --> 04:50.657
MARKET OR IN THE COUNTRY, THEN

04:50.657 --> 04:53.126
DOES THAT MEAN THE DEMAND DRIES

04:53.126 --> 04:54.961
UP AND CHINA BUYS LESS IN THE

04:54.961 --> 04:56.663
WORLD OR DOES THEIR COMMODITY

04:56.663 --> 04:58.064
PRICES DECREASE AND DOES THAT

04:58.064 --> 04:59.332
MEAN THINGS ARE CHEAPER FOR THE

04:59.332 --> 05:01.868
WORLD TO BUY.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.403
>> I THIRTY THERE WERE A LOT OF

05:03.403 --> 05:04.804
PEOPLE STAMPEDING INTO THE

05:04.804 --> 05:07.207
MARKET, UNSOPHISTICATED BUYERS.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.542
CLEARLY THIS IS GOING TO HAMPER

05:08.542 --> 05:12.679
THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO BE

05:12.679 --> 05:14.314
REALLY ARDENT CONSUMER.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.650
WE'VE SEEN CAR SALES ARE DOWN,

05:16.650 --> 05:19.920
HOUSING IS A BIG PROBLEM.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.655
SOME PEOPLE WERE ON MARGIN.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.657
HUGE AMOUNTS OF BORROWED MONEY

05:23.657 --> 05:25.492
TO GO INTO THE STOCK MARKET.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.128
IN SOME CASES PUTTING HOUSES UP

05:28.128 --> 05:29.162
AS COLLATERAL.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.330
SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE

05:30.330 --> 05:31.998
CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO BE RIPPLE

05:31.998 --> 05:32.799
EFFECTS.

05:32.799 --> 05:33.833
>> DOES THE GOVERNMENT IN CHINA

05:33.833 --> 05:35.368
HAVE A CHOICE IN NOT STEPPING

05:35.368 --> 05:36.169
IN?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.038
I MEAN IF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

05:38.038 --> 05:39.406
RETAIL CONSUMERS WHO JUMPED INTO

05:39.406 --> 05:41.541
THE MARKET LATE SAW HUGE LOSSES.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.610
I MEAN, IS THERE THE THREAT OF

05:43.610 --> 05:45.478
POLITICAL INSTABILITY OF PEOPLE

05:45.478 --> 05:46.646
BEING FRUSTRATED WITH THE

05:46.646 --> 05:48.114
GOVERNMENT THAT RALLIED THEM ON

05:48.114 --> 05:49.416
TO BUY.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.284
>> WELL CLEARLY THE PARTY AND

05:51.284 --> 05:52.919
THE STATE FELT THAT THEY WERE

05:52.919 --> 05:54.221
UNDER THREAT IF THE MARKET

05:54.221 --> 05:55.855
CONTINUED TO TANK.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.758
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS AGAIN THIS

05:58.758 --> 06:01.928
ANOMALY SITUATION IT'S SORT OF

06:01.928 --> 06:03.930
THE POTTERY BARN, YOU BREAK IT

06:03.930 --> 06:05.765
YOU OWN IT.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.534
I THINK THE PARTY IN A SENSE

06:07.534 --> 06:09.336
TOOK OWNERSHIP OF THE MARKET

06:09.336 --> 06:10.971
WHEREAS IN MOST COUNTRIES, STOCK

06:10.971 --> 06:14.007
MARKETS ARE NOT CONSIDERED THE

06:14.007 --> 06:16.810
PROVIDENCE OF THE STATE OR THE

06:16.810 --> 06:18.311
GOVERNMENT.

06:18.311 --> 06:18.278
>> ALL RIGHT.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.512
ORVILLE SCHELL OF THE ASIAN

06:19.512 --> 06:21.248
SOCIETY JOINING US TODAY.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.717
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.884
>> Sreenivasan: NOW TO FINANCIAL

06:24.884 --> 06:26.119
TROUBLE IN PUERTO RICO, WHERE

06:26.119 --> 06:27.354
LEADERS WANT TO DECLARE

06:27.354 --> 06:29.055
BANKRUPTCY, BUT CANNOT UNLESS

06:29.055 --> 06:30.490
THE U.S. CONGRESS CHANGES THE

06:30.490 --> 06:31.524
LAW.

06:31.524 --> 06:32.892
PUERTO RICO ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH

06:32.892 --> 06:34.995
IT SIMPLY CANNOT PAY $72 BILLION

06:34.995 --> 06:36.596
IN DEBT.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.098
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO

06:38.098 --> 06:39.966
ALLOW LIMITED BANKRUPTCY RELIEF,

06:39.966 --> 06:41.701
BUT REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S NOT

06:41.701 --> 06:43.236
ENOUGH AND THAT LEADERS NEED TO

06:43.236 --> 06:44.504
ADDRESS THE TERRITORY'S

06:44.504 --> 06:46.606
UNDERLYING BUDGET ISSUES.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.907
IRONICALLY, A NEW REPORT IN THE

06:47.907 --> 06:49.376
"WASHINGTON POST" SAYS CONGRESS

06:49.376 --> 06:50.477
HAS ACTUALLY PLAYED A

06:50.477 --> 06:51.845
CONTRIBUTING ROLE IN THE FISCAL

06:51.845 --> 06:52.979
TROUBLE OF THE U.S.

06:52.979 --> 06:53.980
COMMONWEALTH.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.482
JOINING US NOW WITH THE DETAILS

06:55.482 --> 06:56.616
FROM BALTIMORE IS MICHAEL

06:56.616 --> 06:57.350
FLETCHER WHO HAS BEEN COVERING

06:57.350 --> 06:58.118
THE STORY.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.052
>> YOU WERE JUST DOWN THERE A

06:59.052 --> 07:00.120
FEW WEEKS AGO.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.254
WHAT'S THE U.S. RESPONSIBILITY

07:01.254 --> 07:03.857
IN THIS CRISES?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.091
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.594
THE POLITICAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN

07:07.594 --> 07:10.063
EXECUTED FOR YEARS BY U.S. TAX

07:10.063 --> 07:11.231
PURPOSES ESSENTIALLY.

07:11.231 --> 07:14.100
IN MANY WAYS OR DECADES AGO THAT

07:14.100 --> 07:17.237
LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS

07:17.237 --> 07:23.176
A VERY GENEROUS TAX BREAK.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.179
IT KIND OF SHIFTED TO MORE

07:26.179 --> 07:28.181
INTENSIVE LIKE PHARMACEUTICAL

07:28.181 --> 07:30.050
MANUFACTURING.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.785
THAT MADE PUERTO RICO ONE OF THE

07:31.785 --> 07:35.255
TOP MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD.

07:35.255 --> 07:34.554
THE TOP 20 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

07:34.554 --> 07:39.793
ARE ACTUALLY MADE IN PUERTO

07:39.793 --> 07:41.995
RICO.

07:41.995 --> 07:46.433
THAT DEVELOPMENT TOOK AWAY FROM

07:46.433 --> 07:47.801
OTHER THINGS I MIGHT HAVE DONE

07:47.801 --> 07:49.169
NATURALLY LIKE DEVELOP MORE,

07:49.169 --> 07:52.272
WHAT HAVE YOU.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.840
THE TAX BREAK LASTED BUT THEN IN

07:53.840 --> 07:56.309
1996 CONGRESS DID AWAY, BEGAN TO

07:56.309 --> 07:59.546
TAKE UP THE TAX BREAK AND IN

07:59.546 --> 08:01.614
2006, SINCE THEN PUERTO RICO'S

08:01.614 --> 08:02.916
BEEN IN RECESSION.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.617
>> THEY CAN'T DECLARE BANKRUPTCY

08:04.617 --> 08:07.721
LIKE DETROIT CAN.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.688
>> THEY CAN'T.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.323
THEY'RE TREATED JUST LIKE STATES

08:10.323 --> 08:12.392
ARE UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.394
MUNICIPALITIES AND HOSPITAL

08:14.394 --> 08:15.528
DISTRICTS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.864
THEY CAN DECLARE BANKRUPTCY

08:17.864 --> 08:19.599
WHICH GIVES THEM BREATHING ROOM

08:19.599 --> 08:21.034
TO REORGANIZE THEIR DEBTS.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.769
AND PUERTO RICO CANNOT DO THAT.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.004
FOR THE LAST NINE, TEN, 12

08:25.004 --> 08:26.272
YEARS, PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN

08:26.272 --> 08:28.241
STUCK IN THE CYCLE OF FOLLOWING

08:28.241 --> 08:30.710
MORE MONEY BASICALLY TO PAY FOR

08:30.710 --> 08:32.445
ITS ONGOING OPERATION.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.747
RIGHT NOW CLOSE TO HALF OF THE

08:33.747 --> 08:35.382
BUDGET'S GOES TO DEBT SERVICE

08:35.382 --> 08:36.316
AND THIS IS JUST AN

08:36.316 --> 08:37.784
UNSUSTAINABLE SITUATION.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.186
SO NOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

08:40.186 --> 08:41.888
LIMITED CHAPTER 9 RELIEF.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.157
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

08:44.157 --> 08:47.927
COURSE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY,

08:47.927 --> 08:49.896
SEWER AND HIGHWAYS, THEY WANT

08:49.896 --> 08:51.364
THE ABILITY FOR THOSE

08:51.364 --> 08:53.166
CORPORATIONS AT LEAST TO GO TO

08:53.166 --> 08:54.901
BANKRUPTCY SO THEY COULD WORK

08:54.901 --> 08:56.436
OUT SOMETHING WITH CREDITORS.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.871
AND REALLY THE THREAT FROM

08:57.871 --> 08:59.272
PUERTO RICO IS IF THERE'S NO

08:59.272 --> 09:00.807
CHAPTER 9, THERE WILL BE

09:00.807 --> 09:02.175
BANKRUPTCY BY ANOTHER NAME.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.743
THEY WILL DEFAULT, CREDITORS

09:03.743 --> 09:04.911
WILL HAVE TO SUE AND IT'S A

09:04.911 --> 09:08.148
DRAGGED OUT AND IT'S REALLY BAD

09:08.148 --> 09:09.315
FOR THE ISLAND AS WELL.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.751
>> THERE'S A POLITICAL TENSION.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.987
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, EVEN

09:13.987 --> 09:15.321
THE WHITE HOUSE IS BEHIND THIS

09:15.321 --> 09:17.657
CHAPTER 9 POSSIBLE SOLUTION

09:17.657 --> 09:18.958
WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH BUT

09:18.958 --> 09:20.226
THERE'S SOME TENSION INSIDE THE

09:20.226 --> 09:21.961
REPUBLICAN PARTY SOME FOLKS WHO

09:21.961 --> 09:23.396
MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

09:23.396 --> 09:25.198
VOTES, VERSUS CONCERNED ABOUT

09:25.198 --> 09:27.801
THE HEDGE FUND MANAGERS.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.802
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.237
IT'S KIND OF TIED TO THE

09:31.237 --> 09:32.539
CREDITORS SAYING THEY DON'T WANT

09:32.539 --> 09:33.907
PUERTO RICO TO HAVE THIS

09:33.907 --> 09:36.743
BANKRUPTCY OPTION BECAUSE THAT'S

09:36.743 --> 09:38.611
THE REASON THEY EXTENDED CREDIT.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.313
THEY NEEDED AND COULDN'T GO TO

09:40.313 --> 09:42.982
BANKRUPTCY AND IT'S ANOTHER

09:42.982 --> 09:44.717
LAYER OF PROTECTION THEY DON'T

09:44.717 --> 09:46.252
HAVE TO GO THAT MUCH FARTHER TO

09:46.252 --> 09:47.220
PAY THOSE DEBTS.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.422
THERE'S THAT BUT ALSO YOU LOOK

09:49.422 --> 09:51.024
AT STATES LIKE FLORIDA WHERE WE

09:51.024 --> 09:51.958
HAVE INCREASING PUERTO RICAN

09:51.958 --> 09:53.560
POPULATION.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.463
THERE'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND A

09:56.463 --> 09:57.397
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

09:57.397 --> 09:59.365
CENTRAL FLORIDA, NEW YORK OF

09:59.365 --> 10:00.934
COURSE OR PHILADELPHIA.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.101
BUT THAT CREATES THIS KIND OF

10:02.101 --> 10:03.369
POLITICAL PRESSURE TO DO

10:03.369 --> 10:04.304
SOMETHING.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.438
I THINK BOTH DEMOCRATS AND

10:05.438 --> 10:06.806
REPUBLICANS FEEL THAT.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.974
REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE

10:07.974 --> 10:09.943
BANKRUPTCY.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.312
IT'S LIKE A BAILOUT, I DON'T SEE

10:12.312 --> 10:13.680
HOW IT'S A GOVERNMENT BAILOUT

10:13.680 --> 10:16.749
BUT NEVERTHELESS PUERTO RICO HAS

10:16.749 --> 10:18.852
TO SOMEHOW PAY THIS DEBT.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.553
GIVEN THE WAY CYCLE WORKS IT'S

10:20.553 --> 10:24.524
UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE

10:24.524 --> 10:25.792
AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.428
>> THANK YOU, JOINING US FROM

10:28.428 --> 10:29.195

8,000 MUSLIMS, MOSTLY MEN AND

10:50.884 --> 10:52.285

10:52.285 --> 10:54.087
EXECUTED, THEIR BODIES SCATTERED

11:01.961 --> 11:03.596
FOR A MASS BURIAL.

11:03.596 --> 11:04.964
BUT AT ONE POINT, PEOPLE IN THE

CROWD STARTED SHOUTING, BOOING,

11:06.966 --> 11:09.068
AND THROWING BOTTLES AT VUCIC.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.570
HE WAS HIT WITH A ROCK AND

11:10.570 --> 11:12.505
CHASED OUT OF THE CEMETERY.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.274
VUCIC WAS A HARDLINE ANTI-MUSLIM

NATIONALIST DURING THE CONFLICTS

IN THE 1990'S.

YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD SEE

15:18.985 --> 15:20.753
OF COURSE I DID.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.621
>> Reporter: AND WHAT DID THAT

15:21.621 --> 15:22.722
TELL YOU ABOUT WHO HARPER LEE

15:22.722 --> 15:23.856
IS, I MEAN EVEN JUST THAT LITTLE

15:23.856 --> 15:24.791
SLIVER?

15:24.791 --> 15:25.925
>> I THINK IT TELLS YOU THAT

15:25.925 --> 15:27.226
HARPER LEE ACTUALLY REALLY

15:27.226 --> 15:28.261
DOESN'T LIKE BEING ASKED

15:28.261 --> 15:30.563
QUESTIONS.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.564
>> Reporter: WHILE THE ATTICUS

15:31.564 --> 15:33.266
FINCH IN THE NEW BOOK, "GO SET A

15:33.266 --> 15:35.601
WATCHMAN," HOLDS RACIST VIEWS

15:35.601 --> 15:44.544
AND DENOUNCES INTEGRATION, THE

15:44.544 --> 15:46.846
ATTICUS OF TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD

15:46.846 --> 15:48.614
HAS LONG BEEN HELD UP AS AN

15:48.614 --> 15:50.449
EXAMPLE OF COURAGE.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.984
IN MURPHY'S FILM, "HARPER LEE:

15:51.984 --> 15:54.187
AMERICAN MASTERS," CELEBRITIES

15:54.187 --> 15:56.255
AND AUTHORS DISCUSS THE IMPACT

15:56.255 --> 15:57.690
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD HAD ON

15:57.690 --> 15:58.958
THEIR LIVES.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.692
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

15:59.692 --> 16:01.427
BOOKS I WANTED TO ENCOURAGE

16:01.427 --> 16:02.528
OTHER PEOPLE TO READ.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.796
YOU KNOW, READ THIS BOOK, READ

16:03.796 --> 16:05.565
THIS BOOK, READ THIS BOOK!

16:05.565 --> 16:06.899
>> SCOUT, SIMPLY BY THE NATURE

16:06.899 --> 16:08.534
OF THE WORK, EVERY LAWYER GETS

16:08.534 --> 16:09.702
AT LEAST ONE CASE IN HIS

16:09.702 --> 16:11.237
LIFETIME THAT AFFECTS HIM

16:11.237 --> 16:12.405
PERSONALLY.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.107
THE SMALL TOWN, THE PERSONAL

16:15.107 --> 16:17.009
RELATIONSHIPS, THE PLACE OF A

16:17.009 --> 16:18.878
LAWYER, THE PLACE OF RACE IN THE

16:18.878 --> 16:20.379
SOUTH, IT'S ALL ENCAPSULATED IN

16:20.379 --> 16:23.316
THAT AND AGAIN HE WASN'T

16:23.316 --> 16:25.751
MOUNTING SOME ALTAR TO GIVE HER

16:25.751 --> 16:27.286
A SERMON.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.287
>> Reporter: AND IN MURPHY'S

16:28.287 --> 16:29.755
FILM, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER ANDREW

16:29.755 --> 16:31.591
YOUNG SAYS THE ATTICUS OF

16:31.591 --> 16:33.626
"MOCKINGBIRD" REPRESENTS A

16:33.626 --> 16:35.561
GENERATION OF LAWYERS WHO HELPED

16:35.561 --> 16:36.829
BRING ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS

16:36.829 --> 16:37.864
MOVEMENT.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.399
>> FOR ME, HE REPRESENTS A

16:40.399 --> 16:45.504
GENERATION OF INTELLIGENT WHITE

16:45.504 --> 16:49.675
LAWYERS, WHO EVENTUALLY IN THE

16:49.675 --> 16:52.712
'50s AND '60s BECAME THE FEDERAL

16:52.712 --> 16:54.847
JUDGES THAT CHANGED THE SOUTH.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.781
>> Reporter: SO THIS BOOK IS

16:55.781 --> 16:57.116
COMING OUT AT A TIME WHEN ALL

16:57.116 --> 16:58.885
THESE RACIAL TENSIONS ARE IN THE

16:58.885 --> 17:00.486
HEADLINES EVERY DAY.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.888
DOES THAT MAKE THIS PUBLICATION

17:01.888 --> 17:03.456
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN

17:03.456 --> 17:05.625
IMPACT RIGHT NOW?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.993
>> I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS GOING

17:06.993 --> 17:08.461
TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.963
AND I THINK AS LONG AS THERE'S

17:10.963 --> 17:13.799
ANY KIND OF RACIAL TENSION AND

17:13.799 --> 17:16.168
INJUSTICE AND INTOLERANCE,

17:16.168 --> 17:18.571
ANYTHING HARPER LEE HAS TO SAY

17:18.571 --> 17:19.672
IS GOING TO RESONATE.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.541
AND I THINK "GO SET A WATCHMAN"

17:22.541 --> 17:24.610
IS A PIECE OF SOCIAL HISTORY IN

17:24.610 --> 17:25.444
A WAY.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.413
IT LOOKS BACK AT ALABAMA IN THE

17:27.413 --> 17:29.849
MID-'50s WHEN A LOT OF THINGS

17:29.849 --> 17:32.051
THAT ARE AT ISSUE TODAY WERE

17:32.051 --> 17:33.519
FERMENTING.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.687
>> Reporter: IS THERE PRESSURE

17:34.687 --> 17:36.822
HERE FOR THIS BOOK TO BE AS

17:36.822 --> 17:38.958
MEANINGFUL, AS IMPORTANT TO SO

17:38.958 --> 17:40.359
MANY PEOPLE AS "TO KILL A

17:40.359 --> 17:41.761
MOCKINGBIRD" WAS?

17:41.761 --> 17:45.331
>> I THINK THAT EVERYBODY'S

17:45.331 --> 17:49.201
EXPECTATION IS HIGH, AND YOU

17:49.201 --> 17:50.569
KNOW ANYONE WHO LOVED HARPER

17:50.569 --> 17:52.338
LEE'S VOICE THE FIRST TIME IS

17:52.338 --> 17:55.308
GOING TO WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.943
AS HARPER LEE HERSELF SAID ABOUT

17:56.943 --> 17:58.511
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD," I HAVE

17:58.511 --> 18:00.212
NOWHERE TO GO BUT DOWN.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.848
I MEAN IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT

18:02.848 --> 18:04.317
HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING

18:04.317 --> 18:06.252
THAT'S THAT ENORMOUS AND THAT

18:06.252 --> 18:08.554
POWERFUL AND THAT ENDURING.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.489
SO I'M SURE EXPECTATIONS ARE

18:10.489 --> 18:14.593
HIGH AND I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE

18:14.593 --> 18:16.562
WILL THINK THEY'RE MET AND SOME

18:16.562 --> 18:17.630
PEOPLE WON'T.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.998
I'M NOT A BOOK CRITIC, SO I'LL

18:18.998 --> 18:20.766
LEAVE THAT TO THEM.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.667
>> Sreenivasan: JOINING US NOW

18:21.667 --> 18:23.069
TO DISCUSS "GO SET A WATCHMAN"

18:23.069 --> 18:24.203
IS SAM SACKS, WHO REVIEWED IT

18:24.203 --> 18:25.838
FOR THE FICTION CHRONICLE OF THE

18:25.838 --> 18:27.173
"WEEKEND JOURNAL."

18:27.173 --> 18:29.542
SO, I'M THINKING GREGORY PECK IN

18:29.542 --> 18:31.077
MY HEAD.

18:31.077 --> 18:31.877
IT'S ATTICUS FINCH THE

18:31.877 --> 18:32.979
CHARACTER.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.947
AND IN THIS BOOK, YOU SAY IT'S

18:34.947 --> 18:36.449
DISTRESSING WHAT'S HAPPENED TO

18:36.449 --> 18:37.216
HIM.

18:37.216 --> 18:38.217
>> YES.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.152
ATTICUS FINCH IS REVEALED TO BE

18:40.152 --> 18:41.687
A SEGREGATIONIST.

18:41.687 --> 18:42.989
SOMEONE WHO JOINS AN

18:42.989 --> 18:44.957
ORGANIZATION TO RESIST THE

18:44.957 --> 18:46.192
INTEGRATION MOVEMENT THAT

18:46.192 --> 18:47.326
HAPPENED AFTER BROWN VERSUS

18:47.326 --> 18:48.627
BOARD OF EDUCATION.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.062
>> AND THIS WAS A BOOK THAT

18:50.062 --> 18:52.264
HARPER LEE WROTE BEFORE TO KILL

18:52.264 --> 18:53.299
A MOCKINGBIRD, SO IT'S NOT

18:53.299 --> 18:55.167
SEQUENTIALLY A SEQUEL.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.469
>> EXACTLY.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.670
SHE WROTE IT AS A DRAFT.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.771
IT WAS THE FIRST THING SHE

18:58.771 --> 19:00.306
SUBMITTED TO HER EDITOR.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.875
HER EDITOR SAID WELL, WHY DON'T

19:02.875 --> 19:05.945
YOU DO IT WHEN SCOUT IS A CHILD

19:05.945 --> 19:08.147
INSTEAD OF A 26 YEAR OLD.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.349
YOU SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR HOW

19:10.349 --> 19:11.050
SIGNIFICANT TO KILL A

19:11.050 --> 19:12.151
MOCKINGBIRD CAME.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819
THAT'S A BOOK WE ALL PICK UP IN

19:13.819 --> 19:14.954
ELEMENTARY OR MIDDLE SCHOOL.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.089
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

19:17.089 --> 19:18.391
PIECES OF LITERATURE IN AMERICA

19:18.391 --> 19:20.526
THAT AT LEAST GIVES AN IMMIGRANT

19:20.526 --> 19:21.494
AN INSIGHT TO WHAT THIS COUNTRY

19:21.494 --> 19:23.229
IS ABOUT.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.530
HOW ARE READERS LIKELY TO

19:24.530 --> 19:27.299
RECEIVE WHAT THEY THINK OF AS

19:27.299 --> 19:29.869
REAL RESHAPING OF ONE OF THE

19:29.869 --> 19:31.103
BIGGEST CHARACTERS IN AMERICAN

19:31.103 --> 19:32.405
LITERATURE.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.205
>> IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

19:33.205 --> 19:34.006
INTERESTING.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.874
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

19:34.874 --> 19:36.008
EXTREMELY SHOCKED AND UPSET

19:36.008 --> 19:37.276
FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE OF THEIR

19:37.276 --> 19:41.914
IS A SYMBOL, AN ICON, MORAL

19:41.914 --> 19:44.383
CONSCIOUS OF THE UNITED STATES.

19:44.383 --> 19:48.821
YOU HAVE A MORE COMPLEX AND

19:48.821 --> 19:50.689
COMPLICATED MAJOR OF THIS

19:50.689 --> 19:53.092
CHARACTER NOW.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.395
>> EVEN THE READER YOU POINT OUT

19:56.395 --> 19:58.264
THERE'S A QUOTE IN THERE FROM

19:58.264 --> 20:00.399
SCOUT, THE OLDER SCOUT NEVER

20:00.399 --> 20:02.168
BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY TO ME

20:02.168 --> 20:03.836
AGAIN I DESPISE YOU AND

20:03.836 --> 20:05.871
EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.672
>> IT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT

20:06.672 --> 20:08.674
BECAUSE SCOUT HAS THE SAME

20:08.674 --> 20:10.109
REACTION TO THE DISCOVERY SHE

20:10.109 --> 20:11.477
MAKES ABOUT HER FATHER THAT THE

20:11.477 --> 20:12.511
READER IS GOING TO HAVE.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.013
SHE'S LET DOWN AND JUST AS

20:14.013 --> 20:15.514
DISAPPOINTED.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.283
AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT WELL CAN

20:17.283 --> 20:19.351
SHE EMPATHIZE WITH HIM ANYWAY.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.488
>> IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY FOR

20:22.488 --> 20:24.623
THIS BOOK TO BECOME AS

20:24.623 --> 20:26.492
SIGNIFICANT OR DOES THIS CHANGE

20:26.492 --> 20:28.761
WHETHER MIDDLE SCHOOLS HAND OUT

20:28.761 --> 20:29.995
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.831
>> IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.332
IT ABSOLUTELY COMPLICATES TO

20:33.332 --> 20:34.533
KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.

20:34.533 --> 20:38.237
YOU CAN'T PRETEND THIS BOOK

20:38.237 --> 20:40.339
DOESN'T EXIST.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.674
YOU HAVE TO SAY OKAY THIS IS

20:41.674 --> 20:43.709
ONE PICTURE OF ATTICUS FINCH AND

20:43.709 --> 20:48.013
GIVES US A COMPLICATED PICTURE

20:48.013 --> 20:50.316
OF THE SOUTH AND RACE RELATIONS

20:50.316 --> 20:51.851
IN THE U.S.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.620
IT'S LESS IDEALISTIC AND LESS

20:54.620 --> 20:56.822
FLATTERING BUT MAYBE IT'S MORE

20:56.822 --> 20:58.357
INTERESTING IN THE LONG RUN.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.493
>> THE EXACT THIS IS 50 YEARS

21:00.493 --> 21:02.094
LATER FROM THE SAME AUTHOR, I

21:02.094 --> 21:03.496
MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF TIMES IT'S

21:03.496 --> 21:04.930
HAPPENED BEFORE.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.631
>> I CAN'T THINK OF ANY

21:05.631 --> 21:06.732
PRECEDENT FOR IT.

21:06.732 --> 21:07.800
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER BOOKS THAT

21:07.800 --> 21:10.269
HAVE HAD SEQUELS, GONE WITH THE

21:10.269 --> 21:11.537
WIND HAD SEQUELS BUT THEY WERE

21:11.537 --> 21:13.139
WRITTEN BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS SO

21:13.139 --> 21:15.107
THEY EXIST IN A PROVISIONAL WAY.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.609
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING AT ALL.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.877
YOU CAN'T DISCOUNT THIS BOOK'S

21:17.877 --> 21:19.278
EXISTENCE NOW.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.713
IT LIVES WITH TO KILL A

21:20.713 --> 21:21.881
MOCKINGBIRD SIDE BY SIDE WITH

21:21.881 --> 21:22.715
IT.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.517
>> THIS IS BEING RELEASED AT THE

21:24.517 --> 21:26.752
TIME WHEN A CONVERSATION ABOUT

21:26.752 --> 21:29.388
RACE IN AMERICA HAS RESURFACED

21:29.388 --> 21:30.789
IN SEVERAL WAYS IN THE PAST SIX

21:30.789 --> 21:31.857
MONTHS.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.125
>> IT'S FASCINATING.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.426
IT REALLY SHOWS YOU THAT RACE IS

21:34.426 --> 21:35.895
SUCH A CENTRAL ISSUE IN THE

21:35.895 --> 21:37.296
UNITED STATES.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.364
THE ISSUE OF THE CONFEDERATE

21:38.364 --> 21:39.398
FLAG.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.266
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE THINKING

21:40.266 --> 21:41.967
OF THAT AS THEY READ THIS BOOK

21:41.967 --> 21:43.335
AND IT RESURFACED AGAIN.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.436
>> DID SHE TALK ABOUT WHY SHE

21:44.436 --> 21:45.971
WAITED SO LONG.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.573
>> WELL, IT WAS A DRAFT.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.641
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.376
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO HER

21:50.376 --> 21:53.712
OR HER THOUGHTS.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.882
IT WAS HER, THE EXECUTOR OF THE

21:56.882 --> 22:00.786
ESTATE, HER LAWYER IN ESSENCE.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.556
SHE FOUND THIS MANUSCRIPT AND

22:03.556 --> 22:04.857
PUT IT OUT TO THE WORLD.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.325
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE HISTORY

22:06.325 --> 22:07.593
OF IT OR WHAT SHE THINKS.

22:07.593 --> 22:08.894
