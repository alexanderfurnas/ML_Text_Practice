GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.406 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: back
on the trail.

00:09.877 --> 00:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidates continue their
attacks after
the debate, while Bernie Sanders
makes an

00:14.615 --> 00:16.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appeal to millennials to support
Clinton.

00:16.850 --> 00:22.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
Congress overrides President
Obama's veto

00:22.356 --> 00:28.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a bill which would permit
victims' families
to sue Saudi Arabia for
involvement in the

00:28.462 --> 00:29.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
9/11 attacks.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And our toxic
relationship with
lead.

00:32.966 --> 00:38.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien takes on the
science and America's
ongoing history with the
poisonous metal.

00:38.038 --> 00:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER, Harvard Medical
School: In
most places in the U.S., we use
the children

00:43.010 --> 00:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to tell us where the lead is.

00:44.978 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wait for a child to be
overexposed before
there's investigation into that
child's environment.

00:49.850 --> 00:57.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.724 --> 01:00.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.594 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The name of the game
in the presidential
race today, momentum from Monday
night's debate.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One candidate is hoping to keep
it going and
make new inroads.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The other is looking to recover.

01:17.611 --> 01:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The University of New Hampshire
was the backdrop
for Hillary Clinton's latest
effort to win

01:23.283 --> 01:25.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over young voters.

01:25.085 --> 01:30.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was joined by former rival
Bernie Sanders,
whose presidential campaign was
fueled in

01:30.390 --> 01:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
large part by millennials
burdened by student
debt.

01:33.860 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Going to college should be hard,
but paying

01:40.133 --> 01:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for college shouldn't be so hard
that it prevents
you from getting your education.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how we got to where
we are, but
we are going to fix it.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is wrong.

01:50.577 --> 01:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's wrong for students, it's
wrong for families,
and it's wrong for our country.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:56.016 --> 02:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: First lady Michelle
Obama made
a college swing of her own today
through Pennsylvania,

02:00.320 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigning for Clinton and
taking repeated
swings at Donald Trump.

02:04.091 --> 02:10.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: If a
candidate
regularly and flippantly makes
cruel and insulting

02:10.230 --> 02:19.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments about women, about how
we look, how
we act, well, sadly, that's who
that candidate

02:19.706 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really is.

02:21.575 --> 02:25.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump, campaigning
in the suburbs
of the Upper Midwest, rallied
his troops by

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stepping up his criticisms of
Clinton.

02:28.181 --> 02:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
She disgraced the office of
secretary of state

02:31.385 --> 02:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by putting it up to sale.

02:34.321 --> 02:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if she ever got the chance,
she would
put the Oval Office up for sale
too.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And nobody has any doubt about
it.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we can't let that happen.

02:45.165 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But the campaign is
shifting in
other ways, most of them helpful
to Clinton.

02:50.704 --> 02:55.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Virginia, former Senator John
Warner, a
Republican, appeared with
Clinton running

02:55.442 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mate Tim Kaine to endorse the
Democratic ticket.

02:58.912 --> 03:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And The Arizona Republic threw
its support
behind Clinton, endorsing a
Democrat for the

03:04.618 --> 03:08.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time in the newspaper's
126-year history.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was also more fallout from
Monday's
debate.

03:11.758 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when Clinton raised
Trump's criticism
of a former Miss Universe,
Alicia Machado,

03:17.330 --> 03:18.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her weight.

03:18.999 --> 03:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump defended himself Tuesday,
but Machado
called out Trump again today on
NBC.

03:23.236 --> 03:26.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA MACHADO, Former Miss
Universe (through
translator): That same person I
knew, I see

03:26.840 --> 03:28.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in each one of his speeches.

03:28.575 --> 03:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I see it getting worse, and
I see it even
more harmful and even more
damaging.

03:34.714 --> 03:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The campaign is now
between debates.

03:39.086 --> 03:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next top-of-the-ticket
face-off number
is set for October 9.

03:42.722 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Congress
averted a crisis over funding
the government

03:48.128 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past Friday.

03:49.930 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate easily approved a
bill to keep
things running into December,
and the House

03:54.234 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moved to follow suit.

03:56.203 --> 04:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stalemate ended after House
leaders compromised
on helping Flint, Michigan, with
its lead-tainted

04:01.775 --> 04:03.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The report is in on
the downing
of a Malaysia Airlines plane
over Eastern

04:06.847 --> 04:09.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ukraine two years ago.

04:09.182 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An international investigation,
led by the
Dutch, announced the findings
today.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television
News reports.

04:17.124 --> 04:22.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: Bodies and
baggage and wreckage
were scattered over 50 square
kilometers when

04:22.562 --> 04:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Malaysian 777-200, en route
from Amsterdam
to Kuala Lumpur, disintegrated
at 33,000 feet.

04:31.037 --> 04:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The answers as to the how, who
and why have
been fought over ever since.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we know the how for sure.

04:41.014 --> 04:47.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We have no doubt about the
correctness
of the conclusions that we
present today.

04:47.187 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the conclusion is that on
the 17th July
2014, flight MH17 was brought
down with a

04:54.694 --> 05:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BUK rocket that was launched
from farmland
at Pervomaisk and that the
missile system

05:00.300 --> 05:06.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
arrived from the Russian
Federation, and was
returned there afterwards.

05:06.206 --> 05:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: They presented
videos of
the missile system entering the
Russian-backed

05:11.211 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separatist region east of
Donetsk, four BUK
missiles on board.

05:16.149 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there was film of the
low-loader leaving,
heading back into Russia later
the same day

05:21.855 --> 05:30.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with only three missiles, the
journey reconstructed
with computer graphics.

05:30.730 --> 05:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, triangulated evidence from
photographs
of smoke trails taken by two
different witnesses,

05:38.205 --> 05:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pointing to this charred corner
of a field,
the launch site.

05:42.943 --> 05:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They translated and transcribed
mobile phone
intercepts in which rebel
fighters give the

05:48.848 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
convoy directions.

05:51.451 --> 06:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Russia fired back,
unleashing a barrage
of denials, the international
channel Russia

06:01.027 --> 06:06.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, widely seen as
pro-Kremlin, citing
doubts about most of the
findings, the Kremlin

06:06.333 --> 06:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insisting Ukraine is to blame.

06:08.301 --> 06:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
local officials
say a U.S. airstrike killed 13
civilians early

06:14.608 --> 06:15.642 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The target appeared to be
Islamic State loyalists.

06:18.445 --> 06:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attack struck a residential
building in
Nangarhar Province in the east.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military said it is
investigating
the report of civilian
casualties.

06:27.754 --> 06:34.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United States is
sending another
615 troops to Iraq, adding to
4,500 already

06:34.361 --> 06:36.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is part of an ongoing buildup
to battle
Islamic State forces and to
recapture the

06:39.566 --> 06:41.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
city of Mosul.

06:41.301 --> 06:45.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. units are officially in
a support
role and are not to take a
direct hand in

06:45.772 --> 06:47.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
combat, unless attacked.

06:47.641 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Protesters
gathered overnight
in El Cajon, California, after
the fatal police

06:52.646 --> 06:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shooting of a Ugandan man.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police said that he was behaving
erratically.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His sister said he is mentally
ill.

06:59.319 --> 07:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A cell phone image showed him by
a white truck,
apparently in a shooting stance,
and pointing

07:05.725 --> 07:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something, before he was shot.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turned out, later, though,
that he didn't
have a gun.

07:10.063 --> 07:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In economic news,
Federal Reserve
Chair Janet Yellen reaffirmed
there is no

07:15.502 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fixed timetable for raising
interest rates
again.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but she told a House hearing she
believes
the economy will be ready for a
rate hike

07:23.009 --> 07:24.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the year is out.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Many
of my colleagues indicated in
their recent

07:28.248 --> 07:34.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projections, the majority, that
they would
see it as appropriate to make a
move to take

07:34.821 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a step in that direction this
year if things
continue on the current path and
no significant

07:41.194 --> 07:42.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new risks arise.

07:43.029 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Fed's next
policy meeting
is in early November, just
before the election.

07:47.233 --> 07:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The oil cartel,
OPEC, has agreed
on cutting output for the first
time since

07:52.572 --> 07:54.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a bid to push up prices,
and member
states said today that they will
finalize

07:58.745 --> 08:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the details at a meeting in
November.

08:01.247 --> 08:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In response, prices jumped $2 a
barrel today.

08:04.617 --> 08:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That oil surge
helped energy stocks
in particular, and Wall Street
in general.

08:09.889 --> 08:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
111 points to close at 18339.

08:16.529 --> 08:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose almost 13
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 11.

08:22.302 --> 08:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a first veto
override for President Obama;
the legacy of

08:27.674 --> 08:35.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one of Israel's founding
fathers; how lead
became so pervasive in our
infrastructure;

08:35.315 --> 08:42.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

08:42.622 --> 08:52.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the votes
today on Capitol
Hill to override for the first
time the veto

08:52.632 --> 08:57.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a bill by President Obama --
the issue,
permitting lawsuits against
governments that

08:58.004 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support terrorist acts inside
the United States,
one government in particular.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The bill, on
reconsideration, is passed.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a rare
show of unity.

09:09.082 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators voted 97-1 to override
the president's
veto, with Minority Leader Harry
Reid the

09:15.822 --> 09:17.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lone holdout.

09:17.657 --> 09:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill permits families of
9/11 victims
to sue Saudi Arabia over its
alleged support

09:24.931 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the 19 hijackers, most of
whom were Saudis.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: How can
anyone look
at the families in the eye and
tell them that

09:32.405 --> 09:36.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they shouldn't have the
opportunity to seek
justice against a foreign
government responsible

09:36.943 --> 09:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the death of their loved
one?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLES SCHUMER (D), New York:
It's very simple.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Saudis were culpable,
they should be
held accountable.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they had nothing to do with
9/11, they
have nothing to fear.

09:48.521 --> 09:54.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack left
nearly 3,000
people dead, and the Saudis have
long rejected

09:54.961 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any claim they were involved.

09:57.297 --> 10:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their foreign minister spoke
this past July,
after Congress released a
long-classified

10:02.569 --> 10:06.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
section of the official U.S.
government report
on the 9/11 attacks.

10:06.506 --> 10:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADEL AL-JUBEIR, Saudi Arabian
Foreign Minister:
The CIA director, the director
of national

10:11.077 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence, came out and said
that there
was no involvement of the Saudi
government

10:14.447 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or Saudi officials in the events
of 9/11.

10:18.251 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Senate Intelligence
Committee did its
own investigation, came to the
same conclusion.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so the matter is now
finished.

10:25.425 --> 10:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Saudis also
strongly opposed
this lawsuit bill.

10:30.296 --> 10:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama warned it could
strain relations
with Riyadh and spur retaliation
against Americans

10:36.636 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elsewhere.

10:38.438 --> 10:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his veto message to Congress
on Friday,
the president said: "The bill
doesn't enhance

10:43.610 --> 10:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the safety of Americans from
terrorist attacks,
and undermines core U.S.
interests."

10:50.216 --> 10:55.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
also wrote to
Congress, predicting potentially
devastating

10:55.488 --> 10:59.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consequences for American troops
abroad.

10:59.325 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But supporters largely dismissed
those fears,
and the House joined the Senate
this afternoon

11:05.465 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overwhelmingly rejecting the
president's veto.

11:09.802 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama called the vote
a mistake
and warned that it sets a
dangerous precedent.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get two views now.

11:16.943 --> 11:22.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jack Quinn is a lawyer
representing more than
2,000 families who were impacted
by the attacks

11:22.482 --> 11:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on 9/11 and who are suing Saudi
Arabia.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was also White House counsel
during the
Bill Clinton administration.

11:29.789 --> 11:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael Mukasey, he was
attorney general
of the United States during the
George W.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bush administration.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jack Quinn, let me start with
you.

11:39.732 --> 11:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do these families believe
the government
of Saudi Arabia should be
subject to lawsuits?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACK QUINN, Attorney
Representing 9/11 Families:
Well, they think that any
government that

11:46.940 --> 11:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- with respect to which there
is credible
evidence of governmental
involvement in a

11:51.177 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorist attack should be held
accountable
in the United States.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all JASTA does.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It says...

11:57.116 --> 11:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's the name
of the bill.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACK QUINN: I'm sorry.

11:59.919 --> 12:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Against Sponsors of
Terrorism
Act says, quite simply, that if
a government,

12:04.991 --> 12:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sovereign government, aids and
abets a terrorist
attack inside the United States
that causes

12:10.630 --> 12:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death or injury in the United
States, then
the courts of this country have
jurisdiction

12:15.602 --> 12:18.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over that government.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if you ask most people
in the street,
should that be the law, they
would be shocked

12:21.741 --> 12:23.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that it's not.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And for a long time, frankly, it
was.

12:25.745 --> 12:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration which General
Mukasey served,
the Bush administration, went
into court and

12:31.351 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities
Act would allow suits for
terrorist attacks

12:36.322 --> 12:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the United States like 9/11.

12:38.124 --> 12:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Mukasey,
it sounds
like a reasonable request that
these families

12:42.395 --> 12:43.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are making.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY, Former U.S.
Attorney General:
Yes, it sounds reasonable.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if you look at it closely,
it isn't.

12:49.235 --> 12:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, I don't think
anybody disputes
that the families deserve not
only sympathy,

12:55.975 --> 13:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but recompense and compensation
to the extent
that these losses can be
compensated.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they can't.

13:02.081 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this bill doesn't do it,
doesn't do it,
for at least two reasons.

13:05.318 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, there have been not
one, not two,
not three, but at least four
investigations

13:10.289 --> 13:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by national security officials
in the United
States, by the CIA, the FBI, and
the 9/11

13:19.532 --> 13:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commission that found, directly
concluded
that there was no Saudi
government involvement

13:25.204 --> 13:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or involvement by high Saudi
officials in
9/11.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That has been investigated and
reinvestigated.

13:31.678 --> 13:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is simply no evidence
there to show
Saudi involvement.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just stop
you right
there.

13:39.118 --> 13:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: It's also
counterintuitive
that there would be, because
Osama bin Laden,

13:43.656 --> 13:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he was listing his reasons
for 9/11,
said that the presence of U.S.
troops in the

13:49.829 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Arabian Peninsula was a
principal reason.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were there at the
invitation of the United
States.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was trying to overthrow the
Saudi government.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
evidence...

13:57.904 --> 13:59.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: It's completely
counterintuitive
that they would participate.

13:59.806 --> 14:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jack Quinn, so,
what is the
evidence that the families, that
you are basing

14:03.676 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this on?

14:05.478 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK QUINN: Well, I want to
start by saying
what the judge just said is
flatly untrue.

14:09.882 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those investigations concluded
no such thing.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the 9/11 Commission
report itself,
in a very carefully constructed
sentence,

14:17.690 --> 14:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that -- said, although there was
not evidence
-- that it had not found
evidence of official

14:23.196 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi government involvement, it
conceded
that it was likely that there
was involvement

14:30.236 --> 14:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of people associated
with the government
and charities sponsored by the
governments

14:35.074 --> 14:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that had provided funds to the
terrorist organization
al-Qaida that was behind the
9/11 attack.

14:40.613 --> 14:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But why not sue
those individuals
or those charitable
organizations, rather

14:45.551 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than the government?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACK QUINN: They are sued.

14:48.454 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the government is
responsible because,
we allege, there were officials
of the government

14:57.296 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that participated in the
provision of those
finances to the hijackers.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The story is, frankly, quite
shocking.

15:07.607 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 9/11 commissioners former
Senator Bob
Kerrey, former Congressman Tim
Roemer, former

15:15.681 --> 15:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navy Secretary John Lehman
completely dispute
what the judge just said about
the import

15:21.621 --> 15:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the 9/11 Commission report.

15:23.923 --> 15:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, whether I'm right or
he's right,
the Congress has completely
rejected this

15:30.763 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument that the families
shouldn't have
their day in court.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is now the law of the land.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will have their day in
court.

15:39.639 --> 15:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Senator Schumer said, if
the Saudis
are completely innocent of any
responsibility

15:45.278 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here, they will do just fine.

15:47.747 --> 15:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Mukasey, what
about that
point, that if the Saudis -- if
there is not

15:54.420 --> 15:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- if it turns out that there is
no proof
that the Saudi government or
anyone associated

15:58.891 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Saudi government was
involved, why
not let this go forward?

16:02.695 --> 16:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: A couple
reasons.

16:05.565 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, as -- I don't know
whether you
know this or not, but all a
party has to do

16:11.971 --> 16:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to have a lawsuit go
forward is make
allegations, claims in a
complaint.

16:19.345 --> 16:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that survives a motion to
dismiss -- and
crafty lawyers can file a
complaint that will

16:24.984 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survive a motion to dismiss --
then they get
into what's called discovery,
meaning they

16:29.088 --> 16:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can riffle through the files, in
this case,
of the Saudi government, depose
witnesses

16:34.527 --> 16:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Saudi government, make
them disclose
national secrets.

16:37.563 --> 16:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no sovereign government
in the world
that would ever participate in
an exercise

16:41.300 --> 16:42.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

16:42.301 --> 16:43.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We certainly wouldn't.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's inconceivable that the
Saudis would.

16:47.340 --> 16:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, and, again, it's a situation
where essentially
they're blackmailed into writing
a check.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plenty of governments have
indicated that
-- go ahead.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:57.483 --> 16:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was going to
say, let Mr.
Quinn respond to that.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:59.752 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK QUINN: Yes, again, that was
entirely
incorrect.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge should know this, that
a foreign
government has an immunity to
protect its

17:06.259 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state secrets and sensitive

17:10.630 --> 17:12.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is a fact.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he describes as being
able to bring
a lawsuit by making allegations
and going

17:16.869 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to court, that's the American
system of justice,
and that's the system of justice
that's been

17:21.574 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
denied to the 9/11 families.

17:23.709 --> 17:28.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Congress has now
overwhelmingly said these
citizens deserve that justice.

17:28.748 --> 17:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Mukasey,
you and others
who oppose this are concerned
about the precedent.

17:34.353 --> 17:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the dangerous precedent
that you're
concerned about?

17:37.924 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: There have been
other countries
-- there have been parties in
other countries

17:42.795 --> 17:49.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who have tried to get at
government officials
and at soldiers in places as
diverse as Belgium

17:49.135 --> 17:50.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Italy.

17:50.569 --> 17:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was an attempt to get
Secretary Rumsfeld
charged in Belgium.

17:56.309 --> 18:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been attempts to get
U.S. soldiers
charged in Italy.

18:01.047 --> 18:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the sort of thing that
sovereign immunity
was meant to prevent.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are the most present nation
in the world.

18:08.020 --> 18:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have more people in more
countries in the
world than anybody else, more
soldiers, more

18:13.793 --> 18:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diplomats, more intelligence
gatherers.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every one of them is going to
have a target
on his back after this
legislation, because

18:19.932 --> 18:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people have been trying to
curtail our activities
by going after those people.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they will have a good
excuse for doing
it.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the notion that somehow --
the notion
that somehow they would simply
go after the

18:30.409 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. government is absurd.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This isn't going to be tit for
tat.

18:34.213 --> 18:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be a rat-a-tat-tat
for tat,
and we're going to be on the
wrong end of

18:37.516 --> 18:38.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
10 seconds,
response.

18:40.519 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK QUINN: You know, if a
driver from the
Saudi Embassy runs you over on
your way home

18:44.757 --> 18:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight, you are allowed to sue
that person.

18:48.394 --> 18:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why in heaven's name would
American justice
allow a lawsuit in that
circumstance, but

18:53.733 --> 18:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not to the families of 3,000
murdered Americans?

18:56.602 --> 18:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We thank you
both.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: You're not
talking about
suing a person.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're talking about suing
government.

19:01.607 --> 19:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK QUINN: Correct in both
cases.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Mukasey
-- Michael
Mukasey and Jack Quinn, we thank
you both.

19:06.879 --> 19:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACK QUINN: Thank you so much.

19:13.786 --> 19:23.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The rapid
deterioration of the
situation in Aleppo, Syria,
accelerated today.

19:23.829 --> 19:31.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The rapid
deterioration of the
situation in Aleppo, Syria,
accelerated today.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two hospitals were bombed, among
dozens of
other targets.

19:35.007 --> 19:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNICEF reports that nearly 100
children are
among the hundreds killed since
last Friday.

19:40.946 --> 19:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And harsh words resumed at the
United Nations,
as the U.S. threatened to cut
off all cooperation

19:45.785 --> 19:48.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Russia over Syria.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan reports.

19:49.722 --> 19:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Images in this
story may disturb
some viewers.

19:53.259 --> 19:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Blood mingled
with fresh
bread on the streets of East
Aleppo, the remains

19:58.631 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a bakery, and its customers,
struck this
morning amid the ongoing,
thunderous bombardment.

20:04.870 --> 20:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the terrible stillness after
the attack,
a medical worker told of the
carnage.

20:09.375 --> 20:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
Russian planes
started dropping missiles and
rockets.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who were coming to get
bread from the
bakery were martyred.

20:17.483 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number we cannot
reach due to
the number of shells that were
dropped.

20:21.520 --> 20:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, nearby,
two hospitals
referred to by code names M2 and
M10 to hide

20:27.126 --> 20:29.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their locations were also hit.

20:29.562 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are supported by the
Syrian-American
Medical Society, an NGO.

20:33.566 --> 20:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a social media chat group
monitored by
the "NewsHour," medical
personnel and activists

20:38.104 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said only six hospitals remain
operational.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those six hospitals serve a
quarter-of-a-million
people.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now just two of them can perform
surgery.

20:48.380 --> 20:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A worker at one hospital gave a
guided video
tour of the destruction.

20:52.218 --> 20:56.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): At
4:00 this morning,
the barrel bombs surprised us.

20:56.622 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is where they landed, a
total targeting,
major damage here.

21:01.560 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Activists say
that, in the
last eight days, there have been
1,700 airstrikes,

21:07.766 --> 21:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and at least 400 people killed.

21:10.169 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The onslaught triggered new
condemnation at
the U.N. Security Council today.

21:14.406 --> 21:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
leveled his
harshest judgment to date,
blaming Russia

21:18.577 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Assad regime in all but
name.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General:
They know they are committing
war crimes.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Imagine a slaughterhouse.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is worse.

21:28.687 --> 21:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even a slaughterhouse is more
humane.

21:32.324 --> 21:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Russia's
deputy envoy said
the scenes from Aleppo were the
work of rebel

21:37.329 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
propagandists.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVGENY ZAGAYNOV, Russian Deputy
Ambassador
to the United Nations (through
translator):

21:40.966 --> 21:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We call for a rejection of
provocative rhetoric
and to focus all of our
attention and forces

21:44.603 --> 21:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on bringing an end to conflict
in Syria.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have a very good basis
for this based
in Russian-American cooperation.

21:50.776 --> 21:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But that
cooperation, already
tenuous, may be ending.

21:55.548 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Secretary of State Kerry
told Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov in a
phone call that

21:59.818 --> 22:05.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. holds Russia
responsible, and will
cease cooperation with Moscow on
Syria if

22:05.491 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the bombing doesn't stop.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lavrov said it's the U.S. that
must do more.

22:10.663 --> 22:15.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The western government-
controlled sectors
of Aleppo, where more than a
million Syrians

22:15.367 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live, do come under attack from
rebels, but
nothing on the scale of what's
happening in

22:20.206 --> 22:21.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the east.

22:21.740 --> 22:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian army ground units have
now progressed
into the rebel-held sectors.

22:25.344 --> 22:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian state TV showed its
forces fighting
yesterday in a central area.

22:29.148 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
entered Farafrah
District and broke the first
defense line

22:34.153 --> 22:36.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the armed terrorist groups in
the area.

22:36.589 --> 22:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Breaking those
lines also
means breaking the people who
live there with

22:41.060 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strikes from above.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The vast majority are trapped
civilians.

22:45.564 --> 22:51.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This video, also filmed
yesterday, is of the
crushing aftermath of a bombing
and a father

22:51.370 --> 22:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
retrieving his lifeless son.

22:57.176 --> 23:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those screams echoed within the
sanctums of
the Vatican today, compelling
Pope Francis

23:01.313 --> 23:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to warn of a higher judgment
that awaits the
bombers of Aleppo.

23:04.717 --> 23:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): I make an appeal to
conscience

23:09.888 --> 23:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those who are responsible for
the bombings,
who will one day will have to
face the judgment

23:14.927 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of God.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That reckoning
is still
to come.

23:18.163 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for now, no more horrendous
sense of
the sheer despair can be found
than in the

23:23.369 --> 23:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
panicked cries of this man
filmed by the BBC.

23:27.439 --> 23:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His name is Mohammed Janidi, and
he calls
out for his son Husam lying in a
body bag

23:31.677 --> 23:33.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get up.

23:33.779 --> 23:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the body is taken away,
Mohammed is heard
to say: "His mother is going to
go crazy.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She will go crazy."

23:41.320 --> 23:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of Israel's
founding fathers
died last night.

23:58.270 --> 24:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shimon Peres was present at the
country's
very beginning, and served in
just about every

24:02.775 --> 24:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high-level office in the Jewish
state.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has this
remembrance.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We invite Shimon Peres to come
up.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Shimon Peres to come to the
rostrum to
receive the gold medal.

24:11.984 --> 24:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was a
moment of great
promise, Shimon Peres, then the
Israeli foreign

24:16.689 --> 24:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister, accepting the Nobel
Peace Prize
in 1994, along with Israeli
Prime Minister

24:21.960 --> 24:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian
leader Yasser
Arafat.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peres had helped negotiate the
so-called Oslo
Accords.

24:28.901 --> 24:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, accepting the award, he
spoke of his
hopes for a new Middle East.

24:32.638 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIMON PERES, Israeli Foreign
Minister: A
Middle East without wars,
without enemies,

24:38.277 --> 24:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without ballistic missiles,
without nuclear
warheads.

24:42.047 --> 24:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Born in
present-day Belarus,
Shimon Peres was a boy when his
family emigrated

24:47.252 --> 24:52.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Tel Aviv in 1934.

24:53.025 --> 24:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He joined the Jewish resistance
in the 1948
war of independence, and became
a protege

24:58.297 --> 25:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of David Ben-Gurion, Israel's
very first prime
minister.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went on to hold numerous top
defense jobs,
helping build the Jewish state's
military

25:06.905 --> 25:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and its top-secret nuclear
weapons program.

25:10.075 --> 25:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Ben-Gurion's backing, Peres
won a seat
in the Israeli Parliament in
1959, launching

25:14.947 --> 25:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a political career that extended
for over
five decades.

25:18.650 --> 25:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As defense minister under prime
minister Yitzhak
Rabin, he oversaw the dramatic
1976 rescue

25:24.690 --> 25:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Israeli hostages at Entebbe
Airport in
Uganda.

25:29.128 --> 25:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peres himself went on to serve
as prime minister,
first in 1977, and again as part
of a unity

25:34.800 --> 25:37.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government in 1984.

25:37.302 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took a conciliatory stance
toward the Palestinians,
and later, with Rabin back in
power, he conducted

25:43.242 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Oslo negotiations in secret.

25:45.978 --> 25:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The resulting deal, signed in
1993 in Washington,
aimed at establishing mutual
recognition between

25:51.850 --> 25:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel and the Palestinians and
setting them
on a path toward peace.

25:55.654 --> 26:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIMON PERES: From this green,
promising lawn
of the White House, let's say
together in

26:04.363 --> 26:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the language of our Bible,
peace, peace to
him that is far off, and to him
that is near.

26:14.640 --> 26:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just two years
later, Rabin
was assassinated by a Jewish
extremist, and

26:19.311 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peres again became acting prime
minister for
a time.

26:22.781 --> 26:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But amid renewed confrontation
with the Palestinians,
a harder-line Israeli government
took power,

26:28.253 --> 26:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
led by Benjamin Netanyahu.

26:31.123 --> 26:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conflict soon deepened, and
the second
Palestinian intifada, or
uprising, erupted.

26:37.262 --> 26:42.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In early 2002, as the fighting
began to peak,
Peres, who was again serving as
foreign minister,

26:43.001 --> 26:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sat for an interview with the
"NewsHour."

26:44.503 --> 26:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIMON PERES: It's very hard
upon us, and
even our eyes are full of tears.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Palestinians are killing
their political
existence.

26:53.912 --> 26:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still, Peres
continued advocating
for peace after his 2007
election as president,

26:59.985 --> 27:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which, in Israel, is a largely
ceremonial
role.

27:03.655 --> 27:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shimon Peres left Israeli
politics for good
in 2014.

27:07.559 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In recent weeks, he suffered a
stroke that
finally took his life.

27:11.663 --> 27:16.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prime Minister Netanyahu
reflected today on
their long, sometimes
contentious relationship.

27:16.602 --> 27:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister
(through translator): We had
disagreements,

27:21.039 --> 27:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, even in those cases, the
respect I had
for Shimon was never affected in
any way.

27:26.578 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Palestinian
President Mahmoud
Abbas called Peres a partner,
one who strived

27:31.450 --> 27:34.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to find a just peace.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Shimon Peres was 93 years old.

27:37.289 --> 27:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to help us
understand more
about Peres' life and the legacy
is a man

27:43.262 --> 27:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who knew him well, journalist
and New York
Times columnist Thomas Friedman.

27:46.431 --> 27:47.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN, The New York
Times: Thank
you.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You knew the
man.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You traveled with him.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was your friend.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us a little bit about the
man you knew.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I think
the thing that
stands out about Peres most from
other Middle

27:56.975 --> 28:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East leaders who I have covered
over the years
is that, at the end of his days,
as he grew

28:01.346 --> 28:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
older, he could stand in another
man's shoes,
another woman's shoes.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's very unusual in the
Middle East.

28:07.653 --> 28:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The iron rule of Middle East
politics, William,
is, I'm weak, how can I
compromise?

28:11.456 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm strong, why should I
compromise?

28:13.659 --> 28:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rarely do you get a leader who
actually said,
maybe we could actually find a
middle ground.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as he grew older as a
statesman, Peres
was that person.

28:21.333 --> 28:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Help me
understand what,
to my mind, seems something of a
contradiction.

28:25.671 --> 28:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man who spent the
early part of
his life building Israel
military, its weapons

28:30.943 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs, its settlements, its
defenses, and
then spends the last half of his
life trying

28:35.681 --> 28:39.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to promote peace and, in
essence, not have
to use those weapons.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that a contradiction, or is
that just progression?

28:41.520 --> 28:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I think
he came to
realize that, in that part of
the world, it's

28:45.657 --> 28:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so easy to keep letting the past
bury the
future.

28:48.860 --> 28:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, after doing that
for enough years
-- he was really in politics,
you know, for

28:54.566 --> 28:56.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
70 years of his life.

28:56.034 --> 28:59.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He saw the military solution on
both sides
fail and fail and fail.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He decided to see if he could
get the future
to bury the past.

29:02.741 --> 29:09.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We saw
Netanyahu and Abbas
both speak very movingly of him
after he died.

29:09.181 --> 29:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bitter truth is that we
are a very,
very long way from a two-state
solution or

29:13.518 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any peace process.

29:16.188 --> 29:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Palestinian point of
view, what does
his legacy look like to them?

29:19.591 --> 29:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, from the
Palestinian
point of view, Peres was a
defense minister.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He helped Israel win the 48 war.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He helped as a young man.

29:30.268 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But then, in '56, he was
actually part of
the British-French takeover of
the Sinai.

29:37.142 --> 29:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of the, frankly,
promoters early
of the settlement movement in
the West Bank,

29:42.180 --> 29:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and lost control of it, and
eventually turned
against it.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't a dove, from the
Palestinian point
of view.

29:48.387 --> 29:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Given all of
that, given
that he sort of created the germ
that, in

29:54.626 --> 29:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essence, is the irritant of the
peace process
now, how did he reconcile that
later in his

29:59.831 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, he was a
believer in
the right of the Jewish people
to stay in

30:03.869 --> 30:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their ancestral homeland.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wasn't a dove in that sense.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also understood that the
Jews would
never be at home, never be able
to take their

30:11.543 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shoes off unless Palestinians
could as well
in a two-state solution that
would grant them

30:17.449 --> 30:18.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a state as well.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's where he was at the
end of his
life.

30:20.919 --> 30:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, he spent the early
part of his life
building walls and really
believed that they

30:25.691 --> 30:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were essential to protect and
defend the enterprise
of the Jewish state.

30:29.995 --> 30:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end, I think he came
to realize
that it was only webs, only an
integration

30:35.467 --> 30:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Israel into the region that
was going to
ultimately make it secure.

30:39.471 --> 30:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Given that he
was one of
the founding fathers really of
-- for the

30:43.208 --> 30:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first century of Israel's
existence, he was
there.

30:46.812 --> 30:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does he fit, and where
does his legacy
fit into Israel today?

30:50.549 --> 30:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, you know,
there was
something about Peres and his
generation.

30:54.886 --> 30:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was something big about
all those people,
and, on the Palestinian side,
Arafat as well.

30:59.691 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what you feel today,
William, is that
there is just nobody that big
anymore, and,

31:04.596 --> 31:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there is nobody that big
anymore,
very hard for anyone to make big
compromises.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in the age of incremental
movement,
at best.

31:12.471 --> 31:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the titans that started this
conflict,
that pursued it, that fought
each other all

31:16.908 --> 31:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those years, they have now all
passed from
the scene.

31:19.845 --> 31:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, therefore, we're kind of
missing anyone
who could really call it quits.

31:23.782 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Thomas Friedman
of The New York Times, thank you
so much.

31:29.354 --> 31:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: My pleasure.

31:36.661 --> 31:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now the risks of
lead exposure,
particularly for children.

31:44.336 --> 31:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After some debate, Congress
appears poised
to provide special aid to Flint,
Michigan,

31:48.774 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and possibly other cities with
lead in their
water.

31:52.077 --> 31:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
looks at why lead was used for
so long in

31:57.182 --> 32:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many places, and the health
concerns, part
of our weekly series on the
Leading Edge of

32:03.021 --> 32:04.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
science and technology.

32:04.656 --> 32:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY, Plumber: My
great-grandfather
would be quite proud right now.

32:09.461 --> 32:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But he also might
be a little
worried, because
fourth-generation plumber

32:15.400 --> 32:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Trethewey is showing me
the technique
for molding, shaping and joining
pipe made

32:21.606 --> 32:23.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of lead.

32:23.475 --> 32:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met in the cellar of the
latest renovation
project for the venerable PBS
series "This

32:28.146 --> 32:29.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Old House."

32:29.447 --> 32:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a 1909 arts and crafts home
in Arlington,
Massachusetts.

32:33.218 --> 32:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Let's get started by
talking with Rich
Trethewey, the plumber.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come on in.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Trethewey has
been part of
this famous band of TV
renovators since the

32:40.792 --> 32:42.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
show debuted in 1979.

32:42.761 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: So, in 1909,
this was high
living, because you had a
basement laundry.

32:48.533 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He fired up a
burner and put
some lead in a pot to do some
plumbing the

32:53.805 --> 32:55.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
old-fashioned way.

32:55.674 --> 32:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: When this
house was plumbed,
that lead pot would've been
going all day

32:59.411 --> 33:01.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
long.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In those days,
pipes were not
mass-produced, but rather
custom-tailored

33:04.950 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the work site.

33:06.785 --> 33:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: So, you could
take sheets
of lead and you could shape it
into all sorts

33:09.254 --> 33:10.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of things you need.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could shape it into a round
pipe.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nice thing about it was, it
was a relatively
low melting point.

33:15.594 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lead melts at
about 620 degrees
Fahrenheit, and it holds heat,
so it's easy

33:22.500 --> 33:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to mold, a lead pipe cinch.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a work of art in a way.

33:27.772 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: I guess so.

33:28.807 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I guess so.

33:29.808 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will kill you, but it's a
work of art.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:31.810 --> 33:32.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is that little detail.

33:34.446 --> 33:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our love/hate relationship with
the element
lead is as old as history
itself.

33:38.083 --> 33:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Romans used lead pipes to
carry water
from the aqueducts into their
homes.

33:42.821 --> 33:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, the word plumbing comes
from the
Latin word for lead, plumbum.

33:48.093 --> 33:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even then, the Romans knew high
exposure to
lead was dangerous.

33:52.364 --> 33:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The ancient physician
Dioscorides once wrote:
"Lead makes the mind give way."

33:57.702 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for centuries, no one knew
the consequences
of low doses of lead.

34:03.541 --> 34:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That changed in the 1970s,
thanks to this
man.

34:07.412 --> 34:12.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pediatrician and child
psychiatrist Herbert
Needleman conducted a series of
studies measuring

34:12.851 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lead in children's teeth.

34:15.453 --> 34:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He published the first evidence
that even
relatively low lead exposure can
reduce I.Q.s,

34:20.759 --> 34:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shorten attention spans, delay
language proficiency
and cause behavioral problems.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HERBERT NEEDLEMAN, Pediatrician:
There is
a broad consensus on the part of
everybody,

34:30.368 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
except the lead industry and its
spokesmen,
that lead is extremely toxic at
extremely

34:34.306 --> 34:36.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
low doses.

34:36.207 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Up until the
mid-20th century,
lead was mined and manufactured
for all kinds

34:40.445 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of things besides plumbing.

34:42.814 --> 34:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most notably, it was used for
decades as an
additive to gasoline and paint.

34:47.619 --> 34:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the bad old days, the average
lead level
in American children was high.

34:51.990 --> 34:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1976, it was 15 micrograms
per deciliter.

34:57.162 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as lead was banned in
consumer products,
that number dropped
precipitously.

35:01.199 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is now about one microgram
per deciliter,
a decrease of more than 90
percent.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER, Harvard Medical
School: It's
remarkable.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a great public health
achievement.

35:11.209 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we now know is that the
job isn't
finished.

35:14.079 --> 35:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Epidemiologist
David Bellinger
is a professor of neurology at
Harvard Medical

35:19.150 --> 35:20.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

35:20.986 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER: In most places
in the U.S.,
we use the children to tell us
where the lead

35:24.622 --> 35:26.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

35:26.591 --> 35:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wait for a child to be
overexposed before
there's investigation into that
child's environment.

35:30.261 --> 35:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lead persists in
the soil near
busy highways or smelters, in
old, flaking

35:36.234 --> 35:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paint, and also in vintage
plumbing still
in use, as we discovered in
Flint, Michigan.

35:41.873 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER: There are
tremendous reservoirs
of lead remaining in the
environment as legacy

35:46.711 --> 35:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those past heavy uses.

35:49.447 --> 35:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those sources of lead, we
can come in
contact with remarkably easily.

35:54.719 --> 35:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When lead gets in
our system,
it becomes an impostor.

35:58.857 --> 36:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is similar enough to calcium
that our bodies
get tricked, so cells seeking
that essential

36:04.195 --> 36:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
element take on lead instead.

36:06.431 --> 36:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER: It's really a
global assault
on multiple organ systems at
multiple levels.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a really bad actor.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Especially for
children.

36:17.008 --> 36:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They absorb more lead than
adults and are
much more likely to be harmed by
it, because

36:21.679 --> 36:23.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their brains are still in
development.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BELLINGER: It introduces
noise into
the system, so the brain is not
working as

36:27.685 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efficiently as it would in the
absence of
lead.

36:30.221 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The consensus now by multiple
authoritative
international bodies is, there
is no safe

36:35.460 --> 36:37.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level of lead.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: An estimated 10
million U.S.
homes are still connected to the
water main

36:40.799 --> 36:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with an old lead pipe, usually
buried under
the front yard.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's bad, but it could be worse.

36:47.572 --> 36:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over time, other metals in the
water interact
with the lead, creating a
barrier between

36:52.944 --> 36:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pipe and the water, so it
can flow through
without becoming contaminated
with lead.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: So you can
see the layer,
the coating on the inside right
here.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the dissolved oxygen.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And where it's shiny is where
it's going to
leach.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, where I cut it, you can see
it's leaching.

37:06.925 --> 37:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: To ensure that
barrier is not
washed away, municipalities
usually add an

37:12.597 --> 37:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-corrosive chemical to the
water.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Flint, they stopped doing
that when they
changed water sources.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The water gradually ate away the
protective
barrier.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: It broke down
that inner
layer.

37:24.309 --> 37:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here, it was perfectly
encased, and all
the lead wasn't going to leach.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now you change what happens
inside with
either chlorine or fluorides or
some sort

37:31.983 --> 37:36.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of change on the water
chemistry, and now
that inner coating is gone, and
now it becomes

37:36.387 --> 37:38.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really deadly.

37:38.156 --> 37:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, how would you
know if your
home was connected to the water
main with

37:41.559 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lead pipes?

37:43.361 --> 37:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Trethewey says you need
to find the
where the service comes in and
look for the

37:47.599 --> 37:49.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
distinctive gray color.

37:49.467 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TRETHEWEY: It's a soft,
formable pipe,
and you will really get -- by
eye, you will

37:53.805 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be able to tell it.

37:55.173 --> 37:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If you see it,
have your water
tested right away.

37:58.276 --> 38:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the mineral liner might be
enough to
protect your water, the safest
long-term solution

38:03.114 --> 38:05.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is to get the lead out.

38:05.283 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Digging up and replacing it is
neither cheap
nor easy, but the alternative is
a huge health

38:11.789 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risk to children that will
persist for generations
to come.

38:17.295 --> 38:26.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Arlington,
Massachusetts.

38:26.371 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly a decade
after the great
recession, the pace of creating
a new business

38:34.879 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still slower than it was back
in 2007.

38:37.849 --> 38:43.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new report finds a small
uptick this year,
including in the U.S.

38:43.054 --> 38:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to tech start-ups,
the image
is often of young white men in
hoodies, but

38:48.159 --> 38:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it turns out African-American
women control
about 1.3 million businesses,
and they are

38:54.766 --> 38:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country's fastest growing
group of entrepreneurs.

38:58.203 --> 39:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent April
Brown recently
met two women trying to break
into the club.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ZOLA BOWIE, Caregiver: I love
peanut butter.

39:05.643 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Zola Bowie works as
a caregiver
in the San Francisco Bay Area
for a company

39:10.281 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called Oneva.

39:12.016 --> 39:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She often can be found watching
the Santos
family's three kids, who are all
under the

39:16.120 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
age of 4.

39:18.823 --> 39:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The children's mother, Arlene
Santos, says
she couldn't run her tech
company without

39:22.460 --> 39:24.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the help.

39:24.329 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLENE SANTOS, Oneva Client: As
a career woman,
you don't want to feel guilty
that you have

39:28.499 --> 39:30.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a meeting.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to make sure that home
life is taken
care of.

39:33.871 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's really what Oneva
does.

39:37.175 --> 39:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Marvie Jean Darden,
who also
lives in the Bay Area, had a
stroke two years

39:43.248 --> 39:45.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago and is nearly blind.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she wants to remain in her
home as long
as possible.

39:47.485 --> 39:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARVIE JEAN DARDEN, Oneva
Client: After I
had the stroke, I couldn't do
what I had done

39:50.788 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

39:52.724 --> 39:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also worried about different
people that
we didn't know coming in to the
home and everything.

39:59.631 --> 40:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But since Oneva
introduced Mrs.
Darden to Seadawn Thomas (ph)
those problems

40:05.970 --> 40:07.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been solved.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARVIE JEAN DARDEN: She's more
than a caregiver.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I feel like she's a
friend.

40:14.279 --> 40:18.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Several of Mrs.
Darden's adult
children live nearby, but have
busy lives

40:18.616 --> 40:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and children of their own.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anita Darden Gardyne is one of
them, and part
of the so-called sandwich
generation, with

40:26.424 --> 40:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elder and child care needs.

40:28.826 --> 40:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has an 11-year old daughter,
and Marvie
Jean is her mother.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gardyne realized many others had
the same
issues, so, in 2014, she came up
with the

40:38.002 --> 40:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea for Oneva, a service
providing FBI-background-checked
care providers that customers
can learn more

40:44.509 --> 40:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about before they ever enter the
home.

40:46.678 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ZOLA BOWIE: Well, I'm Zola.

40:47.845 --> 40:49.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm an Oneva caregiver.

40:49.647 --> 40:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Gardyne's business
currently
provides helpers for her
parents, the Santoses

40:53.918 --> 40:55.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and 60 other clients.

40:55.553 --> 40:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But being an African-American
woman entrepreneur
is not without its challenges.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANITA DARDEN GARDYNE,
Co-Founder, Oneva: Our
biggest challenge is cash.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to turn stones that some
folks don't
have to.

41:05.596 --> 41:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in all candor, I don't
-- I don't
have the hoodie, and I'm not the
20-something

41:10.735 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that most people expect to see
or would want
to invest in when you think
about who in Silicon

41:16.307 --> 41:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valley is most likely to be able
to secure
that investment.

41:18.743 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: At a 2015 start-up
competition,
Gardyne was about to make a
pitch for Oneva,

41:23.981 --> 41:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when a potential investor turned
to her husband,
Bob, Oneva's chief technology
officer, and

41:28.686 --> 41:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
another business partner.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA DARDEN GARDYNE: He just
looked at them
and the two men and said, you're
going to

41:32.924 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
let the black girl pitch?

41:34.926 --> 41:35.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that one floored me.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: What was going
through your head?

41:37.362 --> 41:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA DARDEN GARDYNE: I was
angry.

41:39.063 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I literally had to remove
myself.

41:40.898 --> 41:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You certainly believe, as a
woman, you have
done all the appropriate things
that one needs

41:45.236 --> 41:51.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do to be competitive as a
CEO, and it's
disappointing when all that work
is culminating

41:51.676 --> 41:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in someone minimizing you as
just a black
girl.

41:55.480 --> 41:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Gardyne ended up
winning the
competition and being named best
start-up

42:00.017 --> 42:01.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of 2015.

42:01.853 --> 42:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevertheless, she's had a tough
time getting
the attention of venture
capitalists, or V.C.s.

42:07.058 --> 42:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Gardyne is seeking
alternative funding
sources, like Kiva, the
crowdfunding site

42:12.163 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that lets people invest in the
company for
as little as $25.

42:15.566 --> 42:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So, when we actually lend
to Anita or
lend to Oneva, they will
actually do it through

42:21.906 --> 42:22.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a PayPal account.

42:22.974 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The goal, $10,000.

42:24.776 --> 42:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CANDIDA BRUSH, Babson College:
Across the
board, women start businesses
with less money

42:28.246 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than men, whether they are in
technology or
whether they are in consumer
products or whatever.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is about half, 50 percent.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a worldwide statistic.

42:36.654 --> 42:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Candida Brush is
professor of
entrepreneurship at Babson
College near Boston.

42:41.492 --> 42:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says Gardyne's financial
struggle is not
unique.

42:44.228 --> 42:50.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CANDIDA BRUSH: For
minority-owned businesses,
so female-owned, black-owned
firms, start

42:50.568 --> 42:54.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with half the money of
male-black-owned firms.

42:54.172 --> 42:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all minorities start with
less than money
than non-black firms.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it's a challenge.

43:00.978 --> 43:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: V.C.s generally
don't look like
me, from a racial perspective or
a gender

43:07.351 --> 43:09.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
perspective.

43:09.153 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we're seeing that
change, particularly
because of changing
demographics.

43:13.090 --> 43:18.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Millennials, especially
millennial women,
are crashing through ceilings in
ways that

43:18.729 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my generation wasn't always able
to.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, certainly, I'm optimistic
about the future.

43:23.835 --> 43:28.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Angel Rich is one
of those millennials
trying to break through the
glass ceiling,

43:28.206 --> 43:32.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only for African-American
women entrepreneurs,
but for game developers.

43:32.677 --> 43:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She started a Washington, D.C.-
based company
called The Wealth Factory, which
recently

43:37.181 --> 43:39.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developed a free gaming app
called Credit
Stacker.

43:39.484 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL RICH, Founder, The Wealth
Factory: We
want kids like you to know
exactly what to

43:42.787 --> 43:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do with their money before they
actually have
the chance to spend it.

43:46.824 --> 43:50.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Credit Stacker teaches people
how to make
wise credit decisions.

43:50.795 --> 43:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, you have to swap
various pieces
around that represent monthly
payments.

43:55.266 --> 43:58.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have your home loan,
your student
loans, your car loans and so
forth.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ah, we have another
multiple-choice question.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also a credit score that
calculates
as your score.

44:04.442 --> 44:07.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's multiple-choice
questions built
in to assess your knowledge
along the way.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And why a game?

44:09.614 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL RICH: We feel as though a
game almost
tricks people into having fun,
and they end

44:14.051 --> 44:16.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up learning how to manage their
money at the
same time.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And as for money
for her own
start-up?

44:18.356 --> 44:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL RICH: We were honored to
recently be
the global winner of J.P. Morgan
Chase financial

44:24.161 --> 44:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inclusion competition for the
best solution
in the world for serving
vulnerable populations.

44:29.400 --> 44:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They provided us with a $10,000
grant to turn
our online version into the
mobile app.

44:34.338 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Winning a $10,000
grant to help
improve the financial literacy
of students

44:38.676 --> 44:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and families in underserved
communities does
help.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
However:

44:42.847 --> 44:45.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANGEL RICH: Funding is
definitely an issue
for use.

44:45.783 --> 44:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been very creative at
bootstrapping
this company off of revenue
since 2014.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: What is
bootstrapping, for those
who don't know?

44:53.357 --> 44:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGEL RICH: So, bootstrapping
essentially
means operating with no cash.

44:57.695 --> 45:01.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to become very creative
as to how
you come up with things.

45:01.766 --> 45:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, we brought on
15 recent
graduates, gave them work
experience to develop

45:07.405 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
the game and job
recommendations, and, in
turn, we were able to develop
our game for

45:11.876 --> 45:13.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
free.

45:13.678 --> 45:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CANDIDA BRUSH: And what we find
is that women
tend to be more resourceful and
they tend

45:16.614 --> 45:19.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bootstrap their businesses a
little bit
better.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in the long run, what
that means is
that they tend to survive, and
they may not

45:23.854 --> 45:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grow as rapidly, but they tend
to be more
sustainable in certain ways.

45:27.825 --> 45:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL RICH: When you look at
sort of spheres
of influence when you are
raising money, it

45:31.996 --> 45:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really comes down to sort of who
you know
and who you have access to.

45:35.900 --> 45:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm hopeful that, in the
future, those
pipelines will be opened up more
to diverse

45:41.005 --> 45:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communities and the black
population in general.

45:44.375 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Back in the Bay
Area, Oneva is
ramping up to potentially serve
more families

45:48.913 --> 45:52.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like the Santoses.

45:52.750 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company recently signed a
deal with a
Seattle-based Fortune 50 tech
firm that will

45:57.321 --> 46:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer the service as a wellness
benefit to
employees, no up-front money for
Oneva, but

46:02.426 --> 46:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediate access to thousands of
potential
clients.

46:05.963 --> 46:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
April Brown in
San Francisco.

46:12.436 --> 46:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now back to the
campaign, this
time through the eyes of a
highly influential

46:24.982 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
columnist who says she's never
seen anything
like it.

46:28.586 --> 46:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down recently with New
York Times writer
Maureen Dowd about her new book,
"The Year

46:33.891 --> 46:35.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Voting Dangerously."

46:35.326 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the latest addition to our
series Political
Ink.

46:40.231 --> 46:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You say, after years of covering
these people,
that President Obama is too
cool, Hillary

46:44.535 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton is too cold, and Donald
Trump is way
too hot.

46:48.239 --> 46:49.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's a voter to do?

46:50.007 --> 46:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD, Columnist, The New
York Times:
Where were you when I was
writing my book

46:52.109 --> 46:53.077 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blurb?

46:53.110 --> 46:54.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's perfect.

46:54.111 --> 46:55.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:55.112 --> 46:56.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Huh?

46:56.080 --> 46:57.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Yes.

46:57.114 --> 46:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the wild thing about this
election
year.

46:58.616 --> 47:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like the revenge of the
'90s.

47:00.851 --> 47:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of those characters we
started with are
back, you know, in different
capacities.

47:07.692 --> 47:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bill is back as first lady.

47:11.162 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monica Lewinsky is back as a
bullying advocate
-- anti-advocate.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, you know, Hillary is back.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rudy Giuliani is back.

47:20.805 --> 47:22.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Newt Gingrich is back.

47:22.973 --> 47:28.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seinfeld back, in the sense that
Steve Bannon,
who's running Trump's campaign,
made all his

47:28.446 --> 47:29.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money from Seinfeld.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, they're all
back.

47:30.748 --> 47:32.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: They're all back.

47:32.550 --> 47:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, as I read this
book -- and
a lot of it is columns of yours
I have read,

47:35.986 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one...

47:36.987 --> 47:37.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: And Trump.

47:37.988 --> 47:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Trump, of
course.

47:38.989 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Sorry.

47:39.990 --> 47:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One at a time.

47:40.991 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One at a time.

47:42.827 --> 47:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I read them again
altogether, I come
away with the impression you
don't like any

47:44.528 --> 47:46.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these people.

47:46.363 --> 47:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: Well, actually, I
start out
kind of gushing about Barack
Obama and Hillary.

47:51.135 --> 47:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the people who have
interviewed me
said it sounded like you had a
girl crush

47:55.206 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on her in the beginning.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: in the beginning.

47:58.075 --> 48:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: Because, when I
covered her
as the spouse of Bill Clinton
running in '92,

48:02.613 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was super supportive.

48:05.249 --> 48:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I talked about what a
tightrope the first
lady job is, because women like
Hillary and

48:12.156 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michelle have the same
educational credentials
as their husbands, and then they
have got

48:16.227 --> 48:21.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go into these antediluvian,
antiquated
role of the first lady.

48:21.932 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember, when Hillary,
during the campaign,
got delivered stationery, and
they had dropped

48:26.971 --> 48:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Rodham from her name, and
she got all
upset and sent it back.

48:30.641 --> 48:34.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the beginning columns
were supportive.

48:34.078 --> 48:35.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And then...

48:35.079 --> 48:36.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Same thing with
Barack Obama.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Yes.

48:37.915 --> 48:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, with health care, also, I
was so glowing
about her when she went up to
the Hill to

48:41.652 --> 48:43.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
present health care.

48:43.521 --> 48:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then she began the pattern
that has proved
to be so destructive to her to
this day, where

48:48.826 --> 48:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she just builds a wall of
secrecy and defensiveness
and blocking out the press and
my way or the

48:55.666 --> 48:56.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
highway.

48:56.967 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the pattern that's
been repeated
again and again.

49:01.872 --> 49:03.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't help her.

49:03.808 --> 49:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you about
something
that President Obama said
recently at a fund-raiser

49:07.878 --> 49:09.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in New York about Hillary
Clinton.

49:09.747 --> 49:13.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "This shouldn't be a
close election,
but it will be.

49:13.150 --> 49:16.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason it will be is not
because of
Hillary's flaws."

49:16.954 --> 49:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went on to say, it's about
sexism.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Right.

49:20.791 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think that the election
of the first
African-American president and
now the first

49:26.230 --> 49:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman running on a major party
ticket has
definitely stirred up a lot of
racism and

49:31.101 --> 49:32.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sexism.

49:32.937 --> 49:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in some ways, this election
is the primal
scream and death rattle of, you
know, white

49:37.975 --> 49:40.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
men running America.

49:41.011 --> 49:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also think that Barack
Obama set a tone
where he never talked about
things as racist,

49:51.121 --> 49:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even when they really were
racist.

49:53.090 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that would be a good
model for
Hillary, even though, when I
watch Donald

49:58.762 --> 50:05.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump rallies on YouTube, and I
see the scroll
of running comments, they are so
nefarious

50:05.202 --> 50:10.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and vicious, I just want to run
and sign up
for a Hillary -- you know, to
lick envelopes

50:10.975 --> 50:11.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Hillary.

50:11.976 --> 50:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do they lick envelopes anymore?

50:13.043 --> 50:14.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I don't think so.

50:14.411 --> 50:17.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: Send e-mails for
Hillary, because
they're so nasty.

50:17.047 --> 50:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, a lot of that has been
stirred up.

50:19.516 --> 50:25.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, I think
she would
be better off not calling sexism
and modeling

50:25.890 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
herself on the way Obama didn't
call racism.

50:28.659 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Who would you say
you have admired
over the years in politics?

50:32.830 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You speak kindly of George H.W.
Bush.

50:35.099 --> 50:37.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You speak kindly of Joe Biden.

50:37.067 --> 50:38.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Yes.

50:38.869 --> 50:44.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard, because I think I
don't really
want to be the kind of
economist, like Stewart

50:44.642 --> 50:49.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alsop in the old days, or Scotty
Reston, who
really wanted to be friends with
politicians

50:49.613 --> 50:51.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and go to dinner parties with
them.

50:51.382 --> 50:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think of myself as the
watchdog,
which creates problems sometimes
with "Times"

50:57.288 --> 51:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
readers, because I'm not coming
from the left
or the right.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm treating it more like a
political reporter.

51:02.660 --> 51:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You are a Washington
native, something
a lot of people don't know about
you.

51:06.430 --> 51:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have watched the city not
only as a
collection of marble buildings,
but also as

51:11.535 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a community.

51:13.437 --> 51:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How has politics changed, how
has Washington
changed in your years as an
armchair observer,

51:18.909 --> 51:19.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as it were?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN DOWD: Oh.

51:21.679 --> 51:28.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you know, when I went to
see George
H.W. Bush for lunch a few years
ago, I think

51:28.886 --> 51:36.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was just appalled at what had
happened,
because he was a bipartisan, and
he believed

51:36.493 --> 51:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in everyone working together and
civility.

51:39.229 --> 51:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it was very hard
for him to
even fathom the kind of politics
that is being

51:44.368 --> 51:46.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
played nowadays.

51:46.070 --> 51:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope he doesn't tune in to
the debates
because he can't stand Donald
Trump.

51:50.307 --> 51:53.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called him an epithet when I
was at lunch
with him.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, my.

51:55.145 --> 51:59.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: And that was
before Donald Trump
eviscerated Jeb.

51:59.083 --> 52:01.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it's much coarser.

52:01.618 --> 52:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure if what that
leads to is
a lot of other celebrities
jumping in, because

52:07.491 --> 52:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they think, if Donald Trump can
do it, I can
do it, and then we have kind of
a "Dancing

52:12.763 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Stars," kind of B- and
C-level celebrities
jumping into every race from now
on, or if

52:19.303 --> 52:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this will cause people to snap
out of it and
try and get more high-toned
candidates.

52:24.975 --> 52:28.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Whether the
candidates become
more high-tone enough, it's
still tough for

52:28.579 --> 52:29.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the voters.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The name of your book is "The
Year of Voting
Dangerously."

52:32.383 --> 52:38.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's worth it just for the
cover, actually,
"The Derangement of American
Politics."

52:38.455 --> 52:39.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:39.523 --> 52:43.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Maureen.

52:43.861 --> 52:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN DOWD: Thanks, Gwen.

52:48.165 --> 52:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
