ORGANIZATIONS.
THEY'RE EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 527
OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.

09:14.232 --> 09:16.995
THEY'RE EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 527
OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.

ORGANIZATION, YOU CANNOT ENGAGE

TO BE A C-4 SOCIAL WELFARE
ORGANIZATION, YOU CANNOT ENGAGE
PRIMARILY IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.

09:28.919 --> 09:30.782
ORGANIZATION, YOU CANNOT ENGAGE
PRIMARILY IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
AND THAT'S DEFINED PRIMARILY AS

09:30.784 --> 09:32.247
PRIMARILY IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
AND THAT'S DEFINED PRIMARILY AS
ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN 50% OF

AND THAT'S DEFINED PRIMARILY AS
ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN 50% OF

09:33.349 --> 09:34.579
ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN 50% OF
YOUR ACTIVITY.
SO I THINK THE CONCERN ON THE

09:34.581 --> 09:36.278
YOUR ACTIVITY.
SO I THINK THE CONCERN ON THE
PART OF THE I.R.S. -- AND I

09:36.280 --> 09:37.742
SO I THINK THE CONCERN ON THE
PART OF THE I.R.S. -- AND I
THINK THIS IS A LEGITIMATE

09:37.745 --> 09:39.342
PART OF THE I.R.S. -- AND I
THINK THIS IS A LEGITIMATE
CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE AN

09:39.344 --> 09:42.039
THINK THIS IS A LEGITIMATE
CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE AN
OBLIGATION TO ACT ON -- IS THAT

09:42.041 --> 09:43.704
CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE AN
OBLIGATION TO ACT ON -- IS THAT
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY

09:43.706 --> 09:46.269
OBLIGATION TO ACT ON -- IS THAT
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY
MORE ACCURATELY CONSIDERED 527

09:46.271 --> 09:48.600
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY
MORE ACCURATELY CONSIDERED 527
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS PREFER

09:48.601 --> 09:50.465
MORE ACCURATELY CONSIDERED 527
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS PREFER
TO BE SOCIAL WELFARE

09:50.467 --> 09:52.396
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS PREFER
TO BE SOCIAL WELFARE
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER 501 C-4.

09:52.398 --> 09:54.295
TO BE SOCIAL WELFARE
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER 501 C-4.
AND THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT

09:54.297 --> 09:57.291
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER 501 C-4.
AND THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT
IS THAT 527 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

09:57.294 --> 09:58.791
AND THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT
IS THAT 527 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE
TO DISCLOSE PUBLICLY THE NAMES

09:58.793 --> 10:00.856
IS THAT 527 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE
TO DISCLOSE PUBLICLY THE NAMES
OF THEIR DONORS.

10:00.858 --> 10:03.419
TO DISCLOSE PUBLICLY THE NAMES
OF THEIR DONORS.
AND NO SUCH OBLIGATION EXISTS

10:03.422 --> 10:05.518
OF THEIR DONORS.
AND NO SUCH OBLIGATION EXISTS
FOR 501 C-4 ORGANIZATIONS.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.149
AND NO SUCH OBLIGATION EXISTS
FOR 501 C-4 ORGANIZATIONS.
AND SO...

10:08.150 --> 10:09.581
FOR 501 C-4 ORGANIZATIONS.
AND SO...
>> Woodruff: JAY SEKULOW, DOES

10:09.584 --> 10:10.947
AND SO...
>> Woodruff: JAY SEKULOW, DOES
THAT SOUND LIKE THE PRINCIPAL

10:10.948 --> 10:11.811
>> Woodruff: JAY SEKULOW, DOES

DEVELOPMENT GOING ON IN A NUMBER
OF INDUSTRIES.
BIOTECHNOLOGY, MEDICINE.

28:39.867 --> 28:44.494
OF INDUSTRIES.
BIOTECHNOLOGY, MEDICINE.
ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH

28:44.496 --> 28:46.125
BIOTECHNOLOGY, MEDICINE.
ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH
SELF-GENERATING CELLS,

28:46.128 --> 28:48.189
ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH
SELF-GENERATING CELLS,
GENETICALLY MODIFIED CELLS.

28:48.192 --> 28:51.954

SO THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

SO THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE
INVOLVED IN THIS RESEARCH AND

29:00.015 --> 29:01.246
SO THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE
INVOLVED IN THIS RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT ARE, OF COURSE, YOU

29:01.248 --> 29:02.544

29:06.809 --> 29:10.404
THEY'RE GOING TO GET FOR THEIR

THERE IS THIS TENSION IN PATENT
LAW.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.758
THERE IS THIS TENSION IN PATENT
LAW.
PATENT LAW PROTECTS THE

PATENT LAW PROTECTS THE
INVENTION LONG ENOUGH SO THAT

29:27.291 --> 29:30.553
PATENT LAW PROTECTS THE
