17:25.333 --> 17:26.567
UNLIMITED IN THIS SENSE.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.933
WE ALWAYS EVENTUALLY CUT PEOPL

17:28.933 --> 17:29.233
OFF.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.100
WE ALREADY HAD SOME MECHANIS

17:31.100 --> 17:32.967
FOR DECIDING AT SOME POINT WE'VE

WE STILL NEED TO FUND FOR AN

17:42.700 --> 17:43.433
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME?

17:46.100 --> 17:47.167
BENEFITS BEFORE IS 35 MONTHS

17:47.167 --> 17:48.667
AFTER THE END OF A RECESSION

17:48.667 --> 17:50.467
AND WE'RE 55 MONTHS NOW.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.833
SO WE'RE 20 MONTHS, OVER A YEA

17:52.833 --> 17:54.700
AND A HALF LONGER THAN WE'VE

17:54.700 --> 17:56.467

JOBS

18:03.867 --> 18:05.633
FOR NOW, WITH CONGRESS AT AN

18:05.633 --> 18:07.167
IMPASSE, IT LOOKS LIKE TRIST

18:07.167 --> 18:08.867
AND NEARLY 2 MILLION OTHERS WILL

18:08.867 --> 18:10.767
HAVE TO SURVIVE WITHOUT TH

18:10.767 --> 18:11.833
FEDERAL LIFELINE THEY'VE COME TO

18:17.267 --> 18:19.833
ONLY WAY YOU CAN PROSPER, I'VE

18:19.833 --> 18:22.267
LEARNED IS TO KEEP A HIG

18:22.267 --> 18:25.733
SPIRIT, AND SO I JUST LOOK AT IT

18:25.733 --> 18:28.467
AS, WHERE ONE DOOR CLOSES,

18:28.467 --> 18:29.700
SOMEONE WILL EVENTUALLY HIRE ME.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.567

18:49.567 --> 18:50.800
WEEK THAT FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUS

18:50.800 --> 18:52.233
FUND COULD RUN OUT OF MONE

18:52.233 --> 18:53.100
LATER THIS YEAR.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.767
WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF THA

THOSE NOT PAYING ATTENTION WHA

19:03.267 --> 19:05.467
IS THE TRUST FUND AND HOW DID WE

19:05.467 --> 19:06.800
GET THIS CLOSE IT RUNNING OUT OF

19:06.800 --> 19:08.000
MONEY AGAIN Y. BECAUSE FEWER

19:08.000 --> 19:09.533
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AND BASICALLY

19:09.533 --> 19:12.067
IT'S FUNDED BY THE GAS TAX, AN

19:12.067 --> 19:13.800
THAT GAS TAX GOES INTO THIS FUND

19:13.800 --> 19:15.700
AND THIS FUND FROM THE FEDERAL

19:15.700 --> 19:17.300
GOVERNMENT GOES TO STATES TO PAY

19:17.300 --> 19:18.867
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.267
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHORTFAL

19:20.267 --> 19:22.567
AND THAT'S CAUSING A LOT O

19:22.567 --> 19:23.567
CONCERN ON CAPITOL HILL,

19:23.567 --> 19:24.967
ESPECIALLY WITH TH

19:24.967 --> 19:25.633
TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY

19:25.633 --> 19:27.100
HE'S URGING CONGRESS TO STAR

19:27.100 --> 19:28.267
THINKING ABOUT REMEDIES OF HOW

19:28.267 --> 19:30.000
THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THI

19:30.000 --> 19:31.400
SHORTFALL, BUT WITH PARTISAN

19:31.400 --> 19:32.200
GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON, THIS I

19:32.200 --> 19:33.500
GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE TO

19:33.500 --> 19:33.967
SOLVE.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.967
>> SO INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, TH

19:36.967 --> 19:38.700
AFL-CIO AND CHAMBER OF COMMERC

19:38.700 --> 19:39.900
BOTH WENT TOLT HILL AND SAID

19:39.900 --> 19:42.300
WE'RE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE GAS

19:42.300 --> 19:42.900
TAX.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.500
INCREDIBLY UNPOPULAR WIT

19:44.500 --> 19:44.600
CONGRESS

19:44.600 --> 19:45.500
>> ABSOLUTELY.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.700
THAT'S WHY THE GAS TAX HASN'

19:46.700 --> 19:48.800
BEEN INCREASED FOR TWO DECADES

19:48.800 --> 19:50.333
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

19:50.333 --> 19:51.167
INCREASED ANYTIME SOON

19:51.167 --> 19:53.267
IT'S A NON-STARTER IN TH

19:53.267 --> 19:54.433
REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE, AND EVEN

19:54.433 --> 19:56.633
THOUGH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

19:56.633 --> 19:57.800
WANTS CONGRESS TO DO THIS AN

19:57.800 --> 19:59.167
THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T GONE

19:59.167 --> 20:01.167
THAT FAR, BUT THE TRANSPORTATION

20:01.167 --> 20:02.533
SECRETARY COMMENDED THE CHAMBE

20:02.533 --> 20:04.567
FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO DO THAT

20:04.567 --> 20:06.067
SO IT'S GOTTEN THE DIALOGU

20:06.067 --> 20:06.733
GOING.

20:06.733 --> 20:07.733
GOTTEN THE DEBATE GOING, BUT

20:07.733 --> 20:09.000
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE

20:09.000 --> 20:09.900
REMEDY, BECAUSE THAT SIMPL

20:09.900 --> 20:11.100
DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES AND

20:11.100 --> 20:12.133
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER IS NO

20:12.133 --> 20:14.200
GOING TO INCREASE THE GAS TA

20:14.200 --> 20:15.600
ANYTIME SOON

20:15.600 --> 20:17.133
ESPECIALLY WITH HIS TEA PART

20:17.133 --> 20:17.267
CONFERENCE

20:17.267 --> 20:18.000
>> ALL RIGHT

20:18.000 --> 20:19.400
SO WHAT ARE OTHER POSSIBLE

20:19.400 --> 20:21.000
REMEDIES THAT COULD CLOSE THIS

20:21.000 --> 20:22.600
GAP?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.133
>> THERE AREN'T MANY

20:24.133 --> 20:25.600
YOU KNOW, TRANSPORTATION

20:25.600 --> 20:27.133
SPENDING, THE POLITICS OF IT

20:27.133 --> 20:29.033
HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINC

20:29.033 --> 20:31.700
THE STIMULUS WHICH WAS A VER

20:31.700 --> 20:32.733
PARTISAN DEBATE BEFORE THA

20:32.733 --> 20:33.200
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WAS MOR

20:33.200 --> 20:37.333
OF A BIPARTISAN FEELING,

20:37.333 --> 20:39.600
INITIATIVE, BUT NOW, I DON'T

20:39.600 --> 20:40.467
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO D

20:40.467 --> 20:41.633
OTHER THAN JUST MAYBE MOVING

20:41.633 --> 20:43.900
MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO

20:43.900 --> 20:45.333
THE TRANSPORTATION FUND, WHICH

20:45.333 --> 20:46.767
CONGRESS HAS DONE BEFORE, BU

20:46.767 --> 20:49.200
STILL, THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LOT

20:49.200 --> 20:50.533
OF CONSERVATIVES ON CAPITOL HILL

20:50.533 --> 20:52.233
WHO WILL OPPOSE THAT BUT NOT A

20:52.233 --> 20:54.200
LOT OF EASY REMEDIES

20:54.200 --> 20:55.000
OTHERWISE, THEY WOULD HAVE

20:55.000 --> 20:55.800
ALREADY DONE IT.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.533
>> WHAT SORT OF ROAD REPAIRS ARE

20:57.533 --> 20:58.400
AFFECTED WHEN THIS FUND IS SHORT

20:58.400 --> 21:01.467
OF MONEY

21:01.467 --> 21:03.633
>> OH -- MANY, ACROSS TH

21:03.633 --> 21:04.767
STATES, AND BASICALLY WHAT THI

21:04.767 --> 21:06.433
IS GOING TO -- WHAT'S GOING TO

21:06.433 --> 21:08.833
HAVE TO BE SDUN THAT, THAT

21:08.833 --> 21:11.000
STATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CU

21:11.000 --> 21:12.800
FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

21:12.800 --> 21:13.033
PROJECTS

21:13.033 --> 21:14.100
STATES ACROSS COUNTRY ARE GOIN

21:14.100 --> 21:15.267
TO HAVE A SHORTFALL.

21:15.267 --> 21:16.267
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE

21:16.267 --> 21:17.967
MONEY THEY NORMALLY GET FROM THE

21:17.967 --> 21:19.500
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IN ALL

21:19.500 --> 21:20.300
LIKELIHOOD, UNLESS CONGRES

21:20.300 --> 21:21.867
COMES UP WITH SOME BIG

21:21.867 --> 21:23.633
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT, AND THAT'S

21:23.633 --> 21:23.667
UNLIKELY

21:23.667 --> 21:25.267
SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THA

21:25.267 --> 21:27.100
STATES ARE SPENDING ON

21:27.100 --> 21:28.733
INFRASTRUCTURE A GOING TO GO

21:28.733 --> 21:30.433
DOWN, AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

21:30.433 --> 21:31.667
CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE

21:31.667 --> 21:33.833
OF THE STORMS WE'VE HAD, WHICH

21:33.833 --> 21:35.667
HAVE THROWED A NUMBER OF

21:35.667 --> 21:37.067
POTHOLESES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

21:37.067 --> 21:39.033
THAT'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE

21:39.033 --> 21:40.567
OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO FIX

21:40.567 --> 21:41.767
THOSE, BUT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT

21:41.767 --> 21:43.133
STATES WILL HAVE TO CUT TH

21:43.133 --> 21:44.033
AMOUNT OF SPENDING THEY USE ON

21:44.033 --> 21:46.167
TRANSPORTATION

21:46.167 --> 21:46.733

22:37.833 --> 22:38.933
NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE FACT

THAT THE BUTLER HAD TO HAVE BEEN
