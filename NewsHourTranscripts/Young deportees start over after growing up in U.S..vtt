JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.
Department of Homeland
Security conducted a series of
raids over

00:06.440 --> 00:13.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
New Year's weekend on
undocumented immigrants
in a number of states, including
Georgia,

00:13.280 --> 00:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
North Carolina and Texas.

00:15.349 --> 00:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal officials said they have
taken more
than 100 people into custody,
most of whom

00:20.621 --> 00:26.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived in the U.S. within the
past two years,
and are now awaiting
deportation.

00:26.393 --> 00:31.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But immigration groups are
fighting back,
and the nation's highest
immigration court

00:31.164 --> 00:35.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issued a ruling last night to
delay some of
the deportations.

00:35.869 --> 00:41.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even before these moves,
hundreds of thousands
of undocumented immigrants were
being deported

00:41.875 --> 00:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
annually. And for those who grew
up in the
U.S., that means they have found
themselves

00:46.380 --> 00:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living in what feels like a
foreign country.

00:49.583 --> 00:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
from Mexico.

00:54.254 --> 00:59.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Miguel
Ramirez works in
Mexico City, and an almost daily
ritual is

00:59.960 --> 01:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call his mother in Saint
Louis. He lived
there too, until he was deported
three years

01:05.666 --> 01:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, and banned for life from
ever reentering
the U.S.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ, Returnee: She's
-- she's devastated,
you know?

01:12.472 --> 01:18.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The shy
23-year-old, brought
to the U.S. by his mother as a
young child,

01:18.645 --> 01:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admits he fell in with the wrong
crowd. He
got caught in a burglary and his
sentence

01:23.483 --> 01:25.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was community service, until:

01:25.452 --> 01:33.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: I get a note
from the judge
telling me that, because you're
an illegal

01:33.093 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrant, you don't qualify for
this program,
and you're going to have to
start doing your

01:36.897 --> 01:38.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most of his
time was actually
done in immigrant detention
centers before

01:41.768 --> 01:43.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was dropped off at the
Mexican border.

01:43.837 --> 01:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: That, to me, was
rough. It
was one of the roughest things
ever. But,

01:47.341 --> 01:49.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I had to accept it. I
had no choice.

01:49.943 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ramirez is
one of several
young Mexican returnees profiled
in a book

01:54.314 --> 01:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called "Los Otros Dreamers" by
scholar and
social activist Jill Anderson.

01:59.686 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have committed felonies,
she says, but
the vast majority have no
criminal history

02:04.458 --> 02:06.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or just minor infractions.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL ANDERSON, Author, "Los
Otros Dreamers":
For many, it's contact with
their local police

02:09.763 --> 02:17.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for anything from underage
drinking, accusations
from a neighbor or friends. One
young woman

02:17.871 --> 02:20.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was baby-sitting and had a
problem with the
family.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In 2012,
President Obama
issued an executive order that
allowed the

02:26.113 --> 02:30.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
children of undocumented
workers, many of
whom had grown up in the United
States, the

02:30.751 --> 02:32.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
option to remain.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Specifically for certain young
people sometimes

02:35.188 --> 02:37.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called dreamers.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The order
came after Congress
rejected similar legislation
called the DREAM

02:40.927 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act. And it came after perhaps a
half-million
young Mexicans were either
deported or chose

02:46.833 --> 02:48.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to return.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: This was a cute guy I had
a crush on
in my freshman year.

02:51.104 --> 02:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viridiana
and Maggie belong
to Los Otros Dreamers, or the
Other Dreamers,

02:56.309 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group that mostly meets
online, brought
together by Anderson's book.

03:00.547 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Viridiana says, growing up in
Iowa, she felt
no stigma over her illegal
status.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA, Returnee: My parents
always told
me, never tell anyone that we're
here undocumented.

03:09.923 --> 03:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, at first, it was just
kind of like,
OK, I'm young and who cares?
Like, I mean,

03:16.163 --> 03:18.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's so -- what's wrong in
being undocumented?

03:18.398 --> 03:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was no
big deal growing
up, she says, until:

03:23.236 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dad goes to work one day and...

03:25.639 --> 03:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Never comes home.
They went to
his workplace, and they took
him.

03:31.144 --> 03:36.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Twenty-two
years after
he arrived and settled quietly
in small-town

03:36.483 --> 03:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa, Juan Vargas (ph) was
arrested and deported.
That brought abrupt, wrenching
decisions for

03:43.023 --> 03:44.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others in the family.

03:44.891 --> 03:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: My older sister, she
-- she decided
to stay in the United States,
and I totally

03:51.264 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand that. It is my home
too. I do miss
it, but, you know, I would
rather stay with

03:58.238 --> 03:59.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my parents.

04:00.006 --> 04:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viridiana
quit her job
and, with her mother, returned
to Mexico,

04:04.411 --> 04:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against her father's wishes.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: He said: "I don't
want you here.
I don't want you to be here.
Just stay home."

04:10.851 --> 04:15.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Twenty-five-year-old Maggie
got the same advice from her
parents. Home

04:15.222 --> 04:20.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her was Dalton, Georgia,
where she too
felt no different from her wide
circle of

04:20.393 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friends until high school.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE, Returnee: I wanted to go
to work.
I wanted to find scholarships.
That's when

04:25.899 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things started to -- wait, so
you're different?
That's when I started to
actually recognize

04:32.539 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was undocumented and that I
wasn't -- I
didn't have the same
opportunities.

04:36.209 --> 04:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Lacking
money to go to
college or get a legal,
good-paying job, she

04:41.214 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided, agonizingly, to move to
Mexico, a
country she'd left at age 3.

04:46.887 --> 04:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE: My parents stayed. I
came by myself
at 18. And it was during -- this
month, it

04:54.795 --> 05:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was like if somebody had died
inside of me,
because it was like, OK, bye,
house, bye,

05:01.268 --> 05:06.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
church, bye, friends, bye,
school, bye, dog.
I mean, I wasn't prepared.

05:06.406 --> 05:12.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Mexico
wasn't prepared
for her or other returnees
either. Until recently,

05:12.145 --> 05:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. education credentials were
not even recognized.
Aside from official
indifference, Viridiana

05:18.785 --> 05:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says there's social stigma and
suspicion that
they are criminal deportees.

05:23.323 --> 05:28.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Why are you back?
That's like the
first thing that they ask. Why
are you back?

05:28.061 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the problem? They treat
us like crap.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Author Jill
Anderson:

05:32.365 --> 05:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL ANDERSON: They realize,
wow, I thought
I was Mexican. I don't talk like
a Mexican

05:37.904 --> 05:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of my accent when I
speak Spanish.
People actually will call me
pocho or gringo,

05:47.414 --> 05:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and question as to why I'm even
here.

05:50.250 --> 05:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: There is one
industry
that is happy they're here: call
centers,

05:55.555 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whose operators speak American
English.

05:58.124 --> 06:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I get to meet people from
all over
the United States when they call
my employer

06:02.696 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with their customer service
questions.

06:04.664 --> 06:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Call centers
have proliferated
across Mexican cities, their
promotional videos

06:09.636 --> 06:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this one on the Internet
geared to American
customers. It's one of few
places where returnees

06:16.209 --> 06:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can find work. They even waived
the requirement
of a high school diploma for
Miguel Ramirez,

06:21.681 --> 06:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he says they pay a decent
wage.

06:24.251 --> 06:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: This job is very
tedious.
You feel like you're getting
nowhere. It doesn't

06:28.121 --> 06:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make me feel very successful or
proud of myself,
to be honest with you. I want to
do something

06:32.158 --> 06:33.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Call centers
do report
a high turnover. And living in
Mexico, where

06:37.030 --> 06:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many people struggle with life's
more basic
needs, Viridiana says it was
hard for her

06:42.302 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deal with what she saw as
trivial concerns.

06:45.171 --> 06:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: I couldn't handle the
calls. I
was just like, oh, my God, like,
these people

06:48.808 --> 06:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that -- why are they just
complaining about
their dish service? Like,
really? And then

06:55.248 --> 06:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm thinking like, girl, you
used to be one
of those dish people that would
call and be

06:59.719 --> 07:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, what is wrong with you?
Your service
sucks.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:04.524 --> 07:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Like, that really
bothers me, and
I cannot do this job.

07:06.526 --> 07:12.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She now
works as a transportation
dispatcher and lives with her
parents. Her

07:12.098 --> 07:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, Patrice Hidalgo, says,
on a fraction
of their former income, life
here is difficult.

07:17.937 --> 07:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICE HIDALGO, Returnee
(through translator):
Here, because of my age I can't
get a job.

07:22.976 --> 07:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the security situation is
not good. It's
much worse now in Mexico than it
was before

07:28.782 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we left.

07:30.684 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And the
security situation
along the migration routes to
the U.S., now

07:35.155 --> 07:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overrun by gangs trafficking in
drugs and
people, keeps many from fleeing
Mexico again.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you ever contemplate going
back to the
United States illegally?

07:44.698 --> 07:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: I do. I do
contemplate it,
not a lot, because there's a
risk.

07:50.837 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For her
part, Maggie got
a job teaching English, and she
attends college,

07:56.376 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hoping to get into tourism
promotion.

07:58.578 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE: I want to travel more in
this country.
I know it's beautiful. I know it
has many

08:06.453 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
positive things. And I'm
starting to see that
beautiful side of Mexico.

08:10.924 --> 08:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And she
plans to visit
the U.S. again, and often, only
now with passport

08:16.596 --> 08:18.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and visa.

08:18.231 --> 08:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Leon, Mexico.

08:22.635 --> 08:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

08:28.041 --> 08:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.
