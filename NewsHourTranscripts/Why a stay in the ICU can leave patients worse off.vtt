JUDY WOODRUFF: More than five
million Americans are admitted
into hospital intensive care

00:04.833 --> 00:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
units, or ICUs, each year.

00:07.066 --> 00:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Undoubtedly, they are a crucial
component of the health care
system for treating seriously

00:13.233 --> 00:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ill patients and
preventing deaths.

00:15.166 --> 00:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some patients also
eventually leave the ICU with
new complications and problems.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd looks at those concerns
and an effort to make sure

00:25.366 --> 00:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
patients are getting
the right interventions.

00:27.866 --> 00:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, as soon as we get
this ultrasound done, we are
going to get your lights on and

00:33.933 --> 00:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your windows open, OK?

00:35.966 --> 00:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Every year, almost
six million patients land in
an intensive care unit, and,

00:41.833 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through often heroic
efforts, lives are saved.

00:45.133 --> 00:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many of those survivors,
that period of time becomes
a bright line in their lives

00:51.033 --> 00:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of before and after.

00:53.133 --> 00:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL TURPIN, Was Admitted to
ICU: I am very aware that I am
not the same person who went

00:58.066 --> 01:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the hospital with sepsis.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am just not.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In what ways?

01:04.166 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Well,
my personality.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm shorter-tempered, mood
change, mild depression.

01:10.266 --> 01:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Paul Turpin,
an endocrinologist
who lives outside of
Nashville with his wife,

01:17.100 --> 01:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mary Lou, spent a
month in an ICU.

01:20.566 --> 01:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was two-and-a-half
years ago.

01:27.533 --> 01:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Langford's first ICU
stay was a decade ago, and he
has not lived on his own since.

01:33.533 --> 01:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD LANGFORD, Was
Admitted to ICU: Mom is the
one who takes care of me.

01:36.333 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, my mother is 88 years old.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Psychologist Jim
Jackson leads this support
group, and is part of a team

01:46.866 --> 01:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center that helped identify
a constellation of symptoms

01:52.933 --> 01:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mimicking PTSD, post-traumatic
stress disorder.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They call it post-intensive
care syndrome, or PICS.

02:00.733 --> 02:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM JACKSON, Vanderbilt
University Medical
Center: They don't have
a traumatic experience

02:04.433 --> 02:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the way that a combat veteran
or a rape survivor would,
so they're not referred to

02:10.300 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a mental health professional.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They really fall
through the cracks.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With all of these gaps, there
just is a lack of awareness.

02:16.033 --> 02:17.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How do you feel?

02:17.966 --> 02:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Wes Ely
has studied this phenomenon
for almost 20 years.

02:24.866 --> 02:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the risk factors are
clear: powerful sedatives and
prolonged use of ventilators,

02:29.466 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which can trigger delirium.

02:31.733 --> 02:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some ICU patients need
those interventions,
but not all of them do.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY, Vanderbilt University
Medical Center: We had to tie
people down, so they wouldn't

02:39.733 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pull lines and tubes out, but
we also chemically restrained
them with these deep sedatives.

02:44.866 --> 02:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we got comfortable pummeling
people's brains with gargantuan
amounts of benzodiazepines,

02:49.300 --> 02:52.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
propofol, and other
types of sedation.

02:52.266 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We put them in this cocoon,
but it wasn't a safe one.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we started measuring
delirium, and then started
measuring physical immobility,

03:01.966 --> 03:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it unveiled this issue of PICS.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Hi, sweetie.

03:07.233 --> 03:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you open your eyes?

03:09.233 --> 03:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A substantial
number of patients leave the ICU
with newly-acquired problems,

03:14.766 --> 03:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ranging from dementia,
to depression, to muscle
and nerve disease.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Ely has been following
some of them for six years,
and will soon release a study.

03:25.333 --> 03:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Preliminary data show one-third
of patients improve and get
back to normal cognitive and

03:30.266 --> 03:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
functioning levels.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One-third remain the same as
the day they left the hospital.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And one-third
decline even further.

03:38.333 --> 03:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We should talk about
whether we should move the tube
to the neck, OK, because that

03:44.833 --> 03:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will allow us to
decrease the amount of
sedation that you're on.

03:47.400 --> 03:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So, leaders
in acute care developed a
different ICU treatment.

03:52.300 --> 03:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When possible, they keep
patients out of the cocoon
by reducing the use of
drugs and ventilators,

03:59.166 --> 04:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and by getting patients moving.

04:01.233 --> 04:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: Turning off of sedation
every day and turning off
the ventilator every day gets

04:04.700 --> 04:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people out of the hospital
sooner, it decreases
cost of care and it
helps improve survival.

04:08.933 --> 04:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Hospitals across
the country have been slow
to adopt the practices in use

04:13.733 --> 04:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here at Vanderbilt.

04:16.300 --> 04:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been more than four
years since the Society
of Critical Care Medicine
issued new treatment

04:22.033 --> 04:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidelines for controlling pain
and delirium in the ICU, and,
yet today, the organization

04:27.733 --> 04:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
describes compliance
as mediocre.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We're going to
get you every day up
as much as we can, OK?

04:33.466 --> 04:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Coaxing patients
out of bed to exercise takes
a lot more staff time than

04:38.433 --> 04:39.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sedating them.

04:39.966 --> 04:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And getting doctors to change
what has long been done is hard.

04:43.833 --> 04:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: A lot of it has
to do with people in long
white coats, the doctors.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The doctors are used
to how they do things.

04:50.466 --> 04:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want to be told
to do it a different way,
and they're late adopters.

04:54.433 --> 04:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have early adopters in life,
and we have late adopters,
and the doctors think, well,

04:58.366 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is an invisible problem.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't see it.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't see it as
an issue anyway.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can't even necessarily
envision what it is that
could happen so much better.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Vanderbilt used
to release patients from
the ICU with no follow-up.

05:15.733 --> 05:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it is one of a handful of
hospitals with post-ICU clinics.

05:21.866 --> 05:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a way station
for patients at risk.

05:24.200 --> 05:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal is to be a bridge to
a medical world with little
awareness of the syndrome.

05:30.366 --> 05:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Carla Sevin is
one of the founders.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLA SEVIN, Vanderbilt
University Medical Center: The
main purpose of the clinic is

05:36.166 --> 05:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sort of bridge this
million-dollar intensive
care time to this
outpatient status, which

05:41.900 --> 05:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not set up to take care of
the multipronged problems that
people experience after the

05:47.900 --> 05:49.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ICU.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RICHARD LANGFORD: That
might be permanent.

05:51.266 --> 05:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The clinic also
organizes the support group
where Richard Langford is a

05:55.700 --> 05:57.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regular.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD LANGFORD: It helps
give me a structure for why I'm
feeling the way I do, and that

06:04.166 --> 06:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not going crazy.

06:07.133 --> 06:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This anxiety, it is -- is not
something that will kill me.

06:14.233 --> 06:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not something that
I have to worry about,
and keep worrying about
worrying about worrying.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Thank you,
lord, for this nice day.

06:20.833 --> 06:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: As for Paul Turpin,
he is happily back practicing
medicine, and still managing

06:27.733 --> 06:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
emotional ups and downs,
including a lingering
sense of terror, which
is common among ICU

06:33.300 --> 06:34.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patients.

06:34.533 --> 06:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Fear of
ever being in an ICU.

06:39.300 --> 06:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: What is
that fear rooted in?

06:44.133 --> 06:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL TURPIN: Being back in
those circumstances, being out
of control, being wrapped up in

06:48.233 --> 06:49.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that cocoon.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: Is it what
you fear the most in
your life at the moment?

06:52.666 --> 06:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Probably.

06:54.133 --> 06:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WES ELY: You know, you're
an inspiration to us.

06:58.100 --> 07:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Ely, who
travels worldwide to spread the
word about PICS, says he senses

07:04.733 --> 07:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a momentum to shift ICU
care in order to reduce
the harm it can cause.

07:11.233 --> 07:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: People were built to
be vertical and moving around,
not lying in a bed 24/7.

07:16.533 --> 07:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're trying to get back to
the humanness of critical care.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Even so, he
predicts it will be at least
five years before what happens

07:27.333 --> 07:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this ICU becomes the norm for
patients being treated at the
most vulnerable and frightening

07:34.066 --> 07:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time of their lives.

07:35.733 --> 07:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jackie Judd in
Nashville, Tennessee.
