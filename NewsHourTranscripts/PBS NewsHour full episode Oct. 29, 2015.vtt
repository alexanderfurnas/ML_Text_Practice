GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.675 --> 00:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: After decades, China
ends its controversial one-child

00:13.046 --> 00:15.415 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

00:15.415 --> 00:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Thursday: Front-runners
relinquish the spotlight,
highlights from

00:19.519 --> 00:22.623 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the Republican
presidential debate.

00:22.623 --> 00:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And dozens of
refugees still missing after a
boat capsized off the Greek
island

00:27.494 --> 00:28.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Lesbos.

00:28.929 --> 00:35.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:35.903 --> 00:40.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:40.540 --> 00:51.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wisconsin Republican
Paul Ryan became the 54th
speaker of the House of
Representatives

00:51.184 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. He's 45 years old, and
was the party's vice
presidential nominee in 2012.
Now he

00:56.423 --> 01:00.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
faces perhaps his
biggest test yet.

01:00.193 --> 01:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Mr. Speaker, the
speaker-elect, Paul D. Ryan of
the state of Wisconsin.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:09.403 --> 01:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The bipartisan
cheers, handshakes and hugs all
made clear the new speaker is

01:15.208 --> 01:20.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
popular with Republicans and
Democrats. And after taking the
gavel from Democratic Leader

01:20.147 --> 01:23.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nancy Pelosi, Ryan
called for healing.

01:23.650 --> 01:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: The House is
broken. We're not solving
problems.

01:29.823 --> 01:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're adding to them. And I am
not interested in laying blame.
We are not settling scores.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are wiping the slate clean.

01:39.800 --> 01:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That drew a standing
ovation, and Ryan went on,
pledging more transparency,

01:46.506 --> 01:51.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something rebellious
conservatives in his own party
and Democrats alike have
demanded.

01:51.211 --> 01:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: We need to let
every member contribute, not
once they have earned their

01:56.683 --> 02:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stripes, but now. Let people
participate, and they might
change their mind. A neglected

02:03.890 --> 02:10.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minority will gum up the works.
A respected minority will work
in good faith.

02:10.864 --> 02:16.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The nine-term
veteran, who until today chaired
the tax-writing Ways and Means

02:16.103 --> 02:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
panel, said he wants committees
to take the lead in drafting all
major legislation.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan ultimately agreed to run
after demanding unified party
backing.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Ryan.

02:28.348 --> 02:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today, he came
close, winning 236 of the 245
Republican votes cast. The

02:34.621 --> 02:39.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nine opposing him were
conservatives who had helped
force out Speaker John Boehner.

02:39.259 --> 02:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Boehner bade his own
teary farewell, claiming credit
for ending earmarks and passing

02:45.732 --> 02:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a final two-year budget. His
last day in Congress is
Saturday.

02:50.303 --> 02:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), Former
Speaker of the House: I leave
with no regrets, no burdens.

02:54.674 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If anything, I leave the way I
started, just a regular guy,
humbled by the chance to do

03:00.347 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big job.

03:02.816 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I'm most proud of.
I'm still just me. Real change
takes time. Yes, freedom makes

03:12.559 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all things possible. But
patience is what makes all
things real. So, believe in the

03:19.766 --> 03:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long, slow struggle. Believe in
this country's ability to meet
her challenges and to lead

03:24.971 --> 03:27.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

03:27.541 --> 03:33.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Later, the
quarter-century congressman
listened as Pelosi and Ryan
saluted his service,

03:33.447 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then he slipped out
the back of the chamber.

03:38.351 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan's first major challenge
will be passing spending bills
to flesh out the two-year budget

03:43.090 --> 03:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal that passed the House
yesterday. The deadline is early
December.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The commanders of
the U.S. and Chinese navies met
face-to-face today

03:51.932 --> 03:57.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
via videoconference on tensions
in the South China Sea. U.S.
officials said they agreed

03:57.571 --> 04:04.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to follow existing protocols to
avoid clashes. On Tuesday, a
U.S. warship sailed within 12

04:04.511 --> 04:09.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nautical miles of a
Chinese-built island in a
disputed area. The U.S.
maintains the area

04:09.749 --> 04:14.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is international waters. China
warned today against any repeat.

04:14.588 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Vienna, Austria,
talks on the war in Syria are
getting under way, with
uncertain

04:20.627 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prospects. Secretary of State
John Kerry joined envoys from
nearly 20 nations today,
including,

04:26.233 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the first time, a
representative from Iran. Rebel
groups were not invited.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a Syrian human rights
group reported Russian
airstrikes have killed 600,
nearly

04:35.642 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a third of them civilians.

04:38.145 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in Moscow, the Russian
Foreign Ministry rejected that
claim.

04:42.749 --> 04:47.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, Russian Foreign
Ministry (through translator): I
want to stress that

04:47.621 --> 04:52.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such insinuations, whoever they
are coming from and whoever
shares them, they have nothing

04:52.259 --> 04:57.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do with reality. We see them
as a part of that propaganda
campaign to distort Russian

04:57.097 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military actions in comparison
to what we can honestly call
failed efforts of the U.S.-led

05:00.867 --> 05:03.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anti-Islamic State coalition.

05:03.737 --> 05:09.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Russians say
their strikes are targeting
Islamic State and other jihadist

05:09.376 --> 05:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups. The U.S. says, in fact,
the targets have mostly been
rebels fighting the Assad

05:13.146 --> 05:15.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

05:15.015 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Israeli forces
shot and killed two Palestinians
today in the West Bank city

05:19.786 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Hebron. The Israelis said
both tried to stab soldiers. The
incidents led to clashes

05:26.059 --> 05:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Hebron between Palestinian
youths and Israeli forces. It
was another sign that a surge of

05:31.097 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
violence in Jerusalem
is now spreading.

05:34.100 --> 05:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A U.N. committee on
international aviation standards
has rejected a ban on shipping

05:40.040 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rechargeable batteries on
passenger planes. That's despite
evidence they're a fire hazard.

05:46.112 --> 05:52.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was widely reported today
that the committee voted 11-7
against a ban. The U.S., along

05:52.052 --> 05:55.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with pilots and plane
manufacturers, favored the
prohibition. The battery
industry argued

05:55.622 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

05:57.724 --> 06:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In economic news,
Deutsche Bank announced big cuts
to its work force

06:02.162 --> 06:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in eliminating 35,000 jobs,
mostly by selling some of its
businesses. That follows heavy

06:09.102 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losses in the third quarter.
Germany's largest lender has had
to pay heavy fines and legal

06:14.074 --> 06:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
settlements over rigging a
benchmark interest rate.

06:18.044 --> 06:24.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And U.S. growth hit
the skids in the third quarter.
It came in at 1.5 percent,

06:24.718 --> 06:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less than half the number for
the second quarter. That didn't
do much for the mood on Wall
Street.

06:29.322 --> 06:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 23 points to close below
17756. The Nasdaq fell 21
points,

06:36.529 --> 06:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped a point.

06:41.134 --> 06:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
China reverses its one-child
policy; true or false? -- we

06:47.207 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact check the Republican
debate; the search for migrant
survivors off the coast of
Greece,

06:51.344 --> 06:55.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

06:55.982 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to a
massive shift in China.

07:07.327 --> 07:12.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier today, its ruling
Communist Party announced a turn
from its
more-than-three-decades-old

07:12.065 --> 07:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restriction on the number of
children couples can have.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lucy Watson of Independent
Television News reports from
Beijing.

07:20.807 --> 07:27.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCY WATSON: China's one-child
policy is changing, and the end
of its brutal intrusion into
family

07:27.614 --> 07:34.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life is nigh. Couples will now
be allowed two children. For
more than 35 years, the

07:34.054 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one-child rule has been
enforced by punishing families.

07:38.792 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAI XIO LING, Mother: (through
translator): When they fired me
for having a second baby,

07:44.197 --> 07:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were almost too poor to feed
ourselves. We were beaten up for
campaigning for my daughter's

07:50.970 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
life. But nobody
would listen to us.

07:57.811 --> 08:05.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCY WATSON: Bai Xio Ling dared
to have two daughters, Li Bing
(ph) and Li Xue, two sisters

08:05.118 --> 08:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eight years apart. One exists
according to Chinese law. The
other doesn't, just because

08:10.390 --> 08:13.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she came second.

08:13.159 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LI XUE, China (through
translator): I was born in
China. I'm Chinese. But I have
no

08:20.867 --> 08:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights. I couldn't go to school.
I can't travel. I can't see a
doctor. Nothing in my life
works.

08:27.507 --> 08:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCY WATSON: It was in 1979 that
the legislation was introduced
by Deng Xiaoping to curb a

08:34.214 --> 08:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then surging population and
avoid stifling economic growth.
Now a different demographic

08:39.352 --> 08:42.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
crisis looms.

08:42.222 --> 08:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DU PENG, Renmin University
(through translator): A labor
shortage and a rapidly aging
population

08:47.694 --> 08:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
caused by the policy undermine
economic growth. It's not always
good if the birthrate stays

08:51.865 --> 08:55.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
low. We need a more
balanced model.

08:55.034 --> 09:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCY WATSON: But it could be too
little too late in a country
where the rights to have

09:00.440 --> 09:03.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and raise a child are
still being manipulated.

09:03.943 --> 09:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joining me now to
discuss the change is Mei Fong,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning

09:09.949 --> 09:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalist with over a decade of
experience covering Asia. She's
the author of the upcoming

09:14.487 --> 09:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
book "One Child: The Story of
China's Most Radical
Experiment."

09:18.825 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mei Fong, welcome
to the program.

09:21.828 --> 09:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, just how significant a shift
in policy is this for China's
communist leadership?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEI FONG, "One Child: The Story
of China's Most Radical
Experiment": Well, your segment

09:29.569 --> 09:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mentioned too little too late,
and that's really kind of what
it is.

09:34.240 --> 09:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past 15 years now, a lot
of experts of demographics,
economists, demographers,

09:40.547 --> 09:46.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been asking for this change
to happen. They have all warned
of the aging tsunami

09:46.219 --> 09:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's going to happen. They
have warned of the gender
imbalances. But the Chinese
government

09:51.090 --> 09:56.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been very, very slow to
change it, so actually the
question is not why it happened

09:56.463 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, but why has it taken
so long to happen.

09:59.699 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, why do you
think they decided now? I mean,
we heard some of the

10:03.336 --> 10:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reasons there, but what -- what
do you think has led them to do
this right now?

10:07.841 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEI FONG: Well, it's a looming
crisis that's affecting the
economic growth of the future.

10:14.180 --> 10:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, there are about five
working adults to support one
retiree in China. That's a

10:20.153 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty good ratio. But in 20
years' time, that's going to be
1.6 working adults to one

10:27.327 --> 10:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elderly retiree. That's a huge
difference. And there's not
going to be enough people

10:32.232 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pay in for all these pension
imbalances and support an aging
population that, if it

10:37.904 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were its own country, would be
the third largest country in the
world after China and India.

10:43.343 --> 10:48.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
representative, Mei Fong, is the
story we just saw of that
family? They

10:48.548 --> 10:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had two daughters. And one of
the daughters is basically a
non-person.

10:52.552 --> 10:58.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MEI FONG: They call them
heihaizi, black children,
because they don't exist.
They're non-people.

10:58.324 --> 11:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are about, estimated,
between 13 to 15 million of
these children that -- not
necessarily

11:03.963 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children. Now some of them are
adults. But for all intents and
purposes, they just don't

11:07.534 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exist in China. They can't
register to buy a house. They
can't go to school.

11:14.307 --> 11:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That girl that she interviewed,
I spoke to her. Her name is Sno
(ph). She is 20 years

11:19.312 --> 11:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
old. She's never been to school.
She can't even get so much as a
library card, because

11:22.849 --> 11:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she has no registration rights.

11:25.818 --> 11:29.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will the
government now make some sort of
attempt to redress that because

11:29.489 --> 11:31.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're changing the policy?

11:31.658 --> 11:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEI FONG: It's really difficult,
because one of the big issues
that they fear is places

11:36.029 --> 11:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Beijing and Shanghai.
Beijing and Shanghai already
have something like 18 to 20
million

11:38.665 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people, city residents.

11:41.267 --> 11:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are very afraid of changing
the household registration to
enable everybody to have those

11:48.341 --> 11:52.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights, because they fear this
flood of people and there won't
be enough resources to service

11:52.278 --> 11:56.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 million people in the city.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's going to be very thorny.
A lot of people have actually
been suing to have these

12:00.820 --> 12:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights. This girl, for example,
she has been spending the last
three to four years fruitlessly

12:05.425 --> 12:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to sue the government to
give her those rights, which
legally she's entitled to, but

12:08.628 --> 12:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she's still not able to get it.

12:11.497 --> 12:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What difference
is it thought this is going to
make in China's -- in the

12:16.302 --> 12:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decisions families make? I mean,
is it thought that many families
will now decide to have

12:19.005 --> 12:20.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a second child?

12:20.406 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MEI FONG: It's doubtful.
Here's the thing.

12:24.010 --> 12:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every country that's tried to
put in place population controls
have found it much more

12:28.014 --> 12:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easier to turn off the baby tap,
but when it comes time to turn
on the baby tap, there's

12:33.419 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been virtually no country
that's been able to succeed.

12:37.323 --> 12:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Singapore, for example, which
China has emulated for many
things, Singapore tried to do
something

12:41.294 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this, although with a much
less onerous kind of population
planning policy. And now

12:46.733 --> 12:50.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Singapore is saying, please,
please, have more children. And
the Singaporean women don't

12:50.169 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and can't and won't.

12:53.373 --> 12:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think China will face
similar problems. You know,
right now -- a couple years ago,

12:58.745 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they loosened the policy a
little bit, but they found the
take-up amongst people who

13:03.082 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are eligible to have the second
child was very, very low. And I
think this will be more

13:05.818 --> 13:07.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the same.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
we will certainly see.

13:10.757 --> 13:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mei Fong, who is coming out with
a new book, China's one-child
policy, we thank you.

13:16.129 --> 13:26.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MEI FONG: Thank you.

13:26.005 --> 13:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The crowded field of
Republican candidates took to
the debate stage for the

13:33.713 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
third time last night, this
time in Boulder, Colorado.

13:38.017 --> 13:43.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the time they were done,
the chess pieces had shifted
once again.

13:43.122 --> 13:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The face-off, on CNBC, was
expected to focus on the
economy, and, for a time, it
did.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: I'm not
worried about my finances, I'm
worried

13:52.131 --> 13:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the finances of everyday
Americans who today are
struggling in an economy that is

13:55.968 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not producing good-paying jobs
while everything else costs
more.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We're reducing taxes
to 15 percent. We're

14:01.841 --> 14:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bringing corporate taxes down,
bringing money back in,
corporate inversions.

14:05.378 --> 14:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: Big government favors
the big, the powerful,

14:09.015 --> 14:13.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the wealthy and the
well-connected, and crushes the
small and the powerless.

14:13.119 --> 14:17.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: But with 10
Republicans crowded on stage --
four others debated separately

14:17.457 --> 14:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- it quickly became clear each
was looking for a breakout
moment.

14:22.595 --> 14:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Floridians Jeb Bush and
Marco Rubio, it came when the
former Florida governor
criticized

14:28.101 --> 14:32.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rubio for skipping Senate
votes to campaign.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Marco, when you
signed up for this, this was a
six-year

14:34.240 --> 14:36.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
term, and you should
be showing up to work.

14:36.743 --> 14:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, literally, the Senate,
what is it, like a French work
week?

14:40.079 --> 14:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can campaign, or just resign
and let someone else take the
job.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: someone has
convinced you that attacking me
is going to help you.

14:45.084 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH: Well, I have been...

14:45.718 --> 14:46.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO:
Here's the bottom line.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:47.520 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: I'm not -- my
campaign is going to be about
the future of America. It's

14:50.857 --> 14:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to be about attacking
anyone else on this stage.

14:53.493 --> 14:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie also took jabs at
the now lagging Bush after

14:58.364 --> 15:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he'd answered a question about

15:02.368 --> 15:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),

really talking about getting
government

15:03.870 --> 15:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
involved in fantasy football?

(LAUGHTER)

15:07.540 --> 15:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: We have --
wait a second. We have $19
trillion in debt. We have people

15:12.912 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of work. We have ISIS and
al-Qaida attacking us. And we're
talking about fantasy football?

15:16.616 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Can we stop?

just going to have a 10 percent
tithe

15:30.763 --> 15:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's how we're going to
fund the government? And we're
going to just fix everything
with

15:34.200 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that
we're just going to be great? Or
we're going to ship

15:39.105 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 million Americans -- or 10
million people out of this
country, leaving their children

15:43.609 --> 15:47.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here in this country
and dividing families?

15:47.180 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Folks, we've got to wake up. We
cannot elect somebody that
doesn't know how to do the job.

15:53.252 --> 15:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And he said, oh,
I'm never going to attack. But
then his poll numbers tanked.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: The
questions that have been asked
so far

16:05.298 --> 16:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this debate illustrate why
the American people don't trust

about the substantive issues

16:17.276 --> 16:18.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people care about?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: I know the

mainstream

16:22.481 --> 16:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media who every single day...

even in New Jersey, what

16:35.428 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're doing is called rude.

next month in Iowa.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we take a deeper look at
some of the candidates' claims
last night, from medical
supplements,

16:48.841 --> 16:52.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to gender and jobs, to
spotty voting records.

16:52.345 --> 16:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we are joined by Angie
Holan, editor of PolitiFact, an
independent fact-checking

16:57.083 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journalism Web site and a
division of The Tampa Bay Times.

17:01.254 --> 17:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Angie, I want to plunge right in
by talking first about Dr. Ben
Carson, who is currently

17:06.459 --> 17:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many polls leading the race.
He was asked about his
connection to a nutritional
supplement

17:11.264 --> 17:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
company, and this
is what he said.

17:14.300 --> 17:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: This -- there is a
company called Mannatech, a
maker of nutritional
supplements,

17:18.704 --> 17:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with which you had a 10-year
relationship. They offered
claims that they could cure
autism,

17:24.210 --> 17:28.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cancer. They paid $7 million to
settle a deceptive marketing
lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're

17:28.347 --> 17:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
involvement continued. Why?

17:31.384 --> 17:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Well, that's easy to
answer. I didn't have an
involvement

17:35.588 --> 17:40.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with them. That is total
propaganda, and this is what
happens in our society, total
propaganda.

17:40.693 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did a couple of speeches for
them. I do speeches for other
people. They were paid

17:45.331 --> 17:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeches. It is absolutely
absurd to say that I had any
kind of a relationship with
them.

17:51.003 --> 17:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ben Carson says
that's total propaganda, that
question, Angie. True, false or
something

17:55.975 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in between?

17:57.643 --> 18:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN, Editor, PolitiFact:
Well, at PolitiFact, we rated
this false. He said he

18:00.513 --> 18:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had no involvement. Then he
said, well, some paid speeches.

18:04.750 --> 18:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We found the paid speeches.
Also, he appeared in videos that
the company created to promote

18:11.057 --> 18:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their products. Now, the company
was controversial because, in
2009, they settled a lawsuit
about

18:16.329 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
false claims, basically claims
that their supplement could cure
cancer. They settled

18:19.699 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

18:21.567 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whatever you think of the
supplements, the company seemed
to see Carson as someone

18:27.039 --> 18:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who promoted them. They featured
him on their Web site. They
created these videos.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He actually takes
the product himself, he says.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: Yes, he does, and
speaks very highly of the
product.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the company only took down
these videos when The Wall
Street Journal started reporting

18:41.687 --> 18:44.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it and asking questions.
So, overall, the claim that he
didn't have an involvement

18:44.490 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the company is false.

18:47.059 --> 18:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's go to one of
the other many claims made last
night. One is from Carly

18:51.797 --> 18:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fiorina, the former head of
H.P., who doesn't miss an
opportunity to go after Hillary
Clinton

18:55.935 --> 18:59.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on gender issues.
Let's listen to this.

18:59.438 --> 19:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA: It is the height
of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to
talk about being the first

19:06.912 --> 19:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman president, when every
single policy she espouses and
every single policy of President

19:13.552 --> 19:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama has been demonstrably
bad for women.

19:18.157 --> 19:18.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ninety-two percent...

19:18.958 --> 19:21.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

19:21.327 --> 19:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA: Ninety-two
percent of the jobs lost during
Barack Obama's first term
belonged

19:27.266 --> 19:29.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to women.

19:29.468 --> 19:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, the key number
here is that 92 percent. What is
actually true, Angie?

19:34.507 --> 19:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: You know, this is a
funny claim for us, because we
have heard it before. In

19:38.978 --> 19:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2012, it was a talking point
that Mitt Romney would use and
the Republican National
Committee.

19:44.517 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, back then, it was
questionable. We rated it mostly
false. But, back then, we also
didn't

19:49.588 --> 19:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have all the numbers yet for
Obama's first term. Now we do.

19:54.360 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we found when we looked
into the research was that there
were a lot of job gains in

19:59.765 --> 20:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2012. The trend that Romney
identified actually reversed
itself. So, there were job gains

20:04.870 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for women during Obama's first
term, just over 400,000 jobs
gained by women. So, overall,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we rated this talking
point false.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, were they -- was
she just cherry-picking the
right numbers to use to

20:15.514 --> 20:17.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make the case?

20:17.583 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: No, the numbers
were wrong. Once we had all four
years of Obama's first year,

20:22.822 --> 20:26.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were not job losses to be
divided by gender. There were
actually job gains.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I just have to
ask you, when you go back to the
candidates and you say,

20:29.595 --> 20:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey, we -- this is not true,
what do they say? Well, in this
case, what does she say?

20:32.264 --> 20:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: You know, we didn't
hear back from the Fiorina
campaign.

20:35.668 --> 20:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, she has been asked about
some of her facts in follow-up
interviews, especially

20:40.439 --> 20:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the television interviews, and
she often just sticks to her
points and doesn't back down.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's go on to
Senator Rubio. We saw a little
bit of their disagreement

20:48.948 --> 20:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about his voting record, but
let's listen to senator Rubio's
defense.

20:53.752 --> 20:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: In 2004, John
Kerry ran for president missing
close to 60 to 70 percent

20:59.258 --> 21:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his votes. I don't recall the
Sun -- in fact, The Sun-Sentinel
endorsed him.

21:03.329 --> 21:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60
or 70 percent of his votes, and
the same newspaper endorsed

21:07.900 --> 21:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him again. So, this is another
example of the double standard
that exists in this country

21:11.704 --> 21:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the mainstream media
and the conservative movement.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:15.875 --> 21:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, the backstory
is that The Florida
Sun-Sentinel, his home state
newspaper,

21:20.346 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says he should just quit the
Senate, because he's not showing
up to vote. And these are

21:23.449 --> 21:26.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the numbers he used
in his defense.

21:26.152 --> 21:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: We checked the
numbers, and he's right. The
senators who were running for
president,

21:31.624 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama in 2008, Kerry in 2004,
and Bob Graham, the Florida
senator, they did have those
absentee

21:38.731 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers in the ballpark that he
mentioned. Kerry's was actually
a little worse than he

21:41.500 --> 21:44.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mentioned.

21:44.203 --> 21:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was also right that The
Sun-Sentinel did do those
endorsements. Now, The
Sun-Sentinel

21:48.207 --> 21:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sayings: Those weren't our
Florida senator. You are.

21:52.745 --> 21:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should mention that Rubio is
not running for reelection in
Florida. But when we looked

21:58.017 --> 22:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the numbers about senators
who run for president, they
often have these high absentee

22:03.289 --> 22:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates. Of the current field,
Rubio is leading. His absentee
rate is about 34 percent.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When you do these
checks, and there are a lot more
on your Web site, and

22:12.965 --> 22:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you go back to them, does it
change behavior? Do we get truer
statements next time?

22:18.604 --> 22:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGIE HOLAN: You know, it's
interesting. We see the
candidates react in a variety of
ways.

22:22.775 --> 22:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of them don't change at all
and just stick to their talking
points. Others do change,

22:27.112 --> 22:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I can't tell you that it's
any particular political
persuasion.

22:32.017 --> 22:37.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It seems to be more the
candidates themselves, if he or
she thinks that accuracy is
important.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Angie Holan of
PolitiFact, thank you very much.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANGIE HOLAN: Thanks
for having me.

22:43.028 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be checking
in with PolitiFact throughout
the campaign, as they examine
speeches,

22:47.433 --> 22:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ads and debates. Next month, it
will be the Democrats' turn.

22:52.438 --> 23:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:04.850 --> 23:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new round of health care
sign-ups, a new set of
challenges;

23:09.822 --> 23:14.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a wandering author
finds her way home.

23:14.893 --> 23:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for now, the United Nations
Refugee Agency says 15 people
drowned and 38 more are missing

23:22.868 --> 23:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and presumed dead after a series
of accidents involving
traffickers' boats in the windy

23:27.840 --> 23:32.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strait separating Turkey
from Greek islands.

23:32.044 --> 23:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the worst incident, which we
reported on last night, a boat
carrying an estimated 300

23:37.816 --> 23:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people capsized. Of those, more
than 240 were saved and brought
to the island of Lesbos.

23:44.723 --> 23:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports, many of the
rescued are grateful to be
alive,

23:49.194 --> 23:51.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but also angry.

23:51.597 --> 23:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Emotionally
fraught from losing his daughter
at sea, this man from

23:58.337 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mosul in Iraq lashes out
at a fellow survivor.

24:02.908 --> 24:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): He's
the one. He's the one who drove
the boat that sunk. You

24:08.347 --> 24:12.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all attest to that,
and you all know him.

24:12.651 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: U.N. Refugee
Agency officials intervene and
off-camera say the allegation

24:18.090 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is likely to be unfair, because
the smugglers usually appoint a
refugee to steer the vessel.

24:25.064 --> 24:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi, who left Mosul to
escape the so-called Islamic
State, went to the police to
press

24:29.501 --> 24:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his claims. The accused man was
briefly questioned, and later
released. Survivors, camped out

24:35.941 --> 24:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the port of Molyvos, exuded
relief, exhaustion and trauma.

24:40.746 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not yet old enough to grasp the
miraculous nature of their
deliverance, children slept

24:47.052 --> 24:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or played. But this mother was
shocked into virtual silence, as
family reunification teams

24:54.059 --> 25:01.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tried to elicit details
about her missing child.

25:01.934 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Accountant Anas Khaoula, from
Damascus, said the boat was old
and badly modified with an

25:07.473 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extra deck that broke away under
the strain of the waves and
overcrowding.

25:11.710 --> 25:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANAS KHAOULA, Refugee: We stayed
at the water, I think, three
hours or more than three hours,

25:18.784 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, until the police came
to collect us. And there were so
many dead, some of them

25:25.624 --> 25:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dead because of the cold of the
water, and the others was
drowned in the boat when was

25:31.029 --> 25:33.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sinking.

25:33.966 --> 25:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them don't -- don't
know to swim. They sink also.
And there were a lot of
children,

25:39.638 --> 25:42.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

25:42.007 --> 25:47.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The survivors
lined up on the dockside to give
their details to officials,

25:47.446 --> 25:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to collate lists of those
who made it, and those who
didn't.

25:51.316 --> 25:55.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.N. Refugee Agency
protested that people were dying
unnecessarily and called for
more

25:55.721 --> 25:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
search-and-rescue resources.

25:57.923 --> 26:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Field worker Andrew Knight:

26:00.092 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW KNIGHT, U.N. Refugee
Agency: This is one of the worst
incidents that we had in

26:03.796 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recent times, in memory, in
fact, tens of people lost at
sea, just some of the most

26:13.572 --> 26:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awful stories, families, people
still looking for members of
their families. It's absolutely

26:16.608 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
awful, absolutely awful.

26:19.511 --> 26:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The traffickers
have adopted a new tactic,
increasing the price of a ticket

26:24.716 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on a wooden boat to
more than $2,500.

26:30.088 --> 26:34.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Greek-American volunteer
Aphrodite Vati Mariola was
careful to condemn the trade on
the criminals,

26:34.493 --> 26:36.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not ordinary Turks.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
APHRODITE VATI MARIOLA,
Volunteer: There's no respect
for human life whatsoever, in my

26:39.965 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opinion. They just send them
away, and whatever will happen
will happen.

26:44.570 --> 26:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: On this beach,
soaking wet youngsters pulled
from the waves were given

26:50.142 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lollipops to comfort them after
their crossing. In the water,
almost every day, Briton
Philippa

26:57.983 --> 26:59.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kempson:

26:59.651 --> 27:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIPPA KEMPSON, Volunteer:
It's the last couple weeks, and
it's increased the last

27:02.988 --> 27:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day. We had a huge metal boat
with maybe 300 people on board.
Again, it -- well, it was

27:09.027 --> 27:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
further out from the shore than
this one, so -- and it took a
lot of work to get them

27:12.030 --> 27:15.267 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
off, but, again,
they were all safe.

27:15.267 --> 27:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they're just using
anything and everything to get
the amount of people across. I
don't

27:20.172 --> 27:24.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
know how many people are
waiting, but they are using
every boat they can find now.

as the remains of treacherous
inflatables.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The traffickers are weaving
dreams that, for most of their
passengers, are unattainable.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are sending innocent people
to their deaths. They are
causing chaos in Europe,

27:43.762 --> 27:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
possibly undermining the
European Union, all the while
making a fortune.

JUDY WOODRUFF: This Sunday marks
the beginning of open enrollment
in the health insurance

28:22.100 --> 28:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marketplaces that were created
as part of the Affordable Care
Act, as of this summer~,

28:28.473 --> 28:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
9.9 million people who had
gotten coverage through the
state and federal exchanges
under

28:33.345 --> 28:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obamacare. Millions more were
newly covered through Medicaid.

28:38.417 --> 28:42.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heading into the new season,
there are a number of questions
and concerns people are asking

28:42.454 --> 28:45.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about costs, coverage
and penalties.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to spend the next
couple nights looking at those.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mary Agnes Carey of Kaiser
Health News is back with us
again.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mary Agnes, welcome
again to the program.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser
Health News: Thank you.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's start
out by talking about what the
administration's challenge

28:59.237 --> 29:05.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is here. How many people out
there are eligible, but have not
yet signed up for Obamacare?

29:05.310 --> 29:08.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: The
administration says there are
about 10.5 million people that
are

29:08.347 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eligible to enroll in the
exchanges, and they're hoping to
enroll about one in four of
those.

29:13.785 --> 29:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to be a tough
group to go after. Maybe they're
confused about the health care

29:17.289 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law. They may not understand how
it works or that they need to
have coverage, and so

29:20.826 --> 29:24.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they need to have a very
aggressive outreach for this
enrollment period.

29:24.696 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's look
at one of those people who
present, I guess you could

29:28.300 --> 29:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, a challenge. And that is,
this is a woman -- her name is
Angela Denig. She lives near

29:32.938 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miami in Margate, Florida. She
decided not to sign up for
coverage last year.

29:40.912 --> 29:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said she was willing to pay
the penalty. She'd rather do
that. She ended up having

29:44.616 --> 29:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a health scare, and she's trying
to decide what to do now. Let's
listen.

29:48.320 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA DENIG, Florida Resident:
When the open enrollment was in
2013, I went online to explore

29:54.259 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my options, and when I plugged
in my specific factors and my
situation, I didn't qualify

29:59.331 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the -- for any subsidy.

30:03.101 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what it offered me was
coverage through independent
agencies, and the premiums were

30:09.341 --> 30:15.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
significantly expensive,
something that wasn't in my
budget. So, at that point, I had
to

30:15.580 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decide that I couldn't afford
medical insurance. Full-time
employment, I pay my taxes, I
pay

30:20.052 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my bills, I live by the letter
of the law, and the letter of
the law said that year that,

30:24.456 --> 30:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even though I couldn't afford
medical coverage, I was required
to pay this penalty, and I

30:28.560 --> 30:31.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
did. And it hurt.

30:31.163 --> 30:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes,
what does the administration do
to appeal, to win over people

30:37.102 --> 30:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this, who -- it's not just
a matter of persuading them. It
sounds like she genuinely

30:40.238 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has an issue with the cost.

30:41.139 --> 30:43.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Right.

30:43.308 --> 30:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they're asking people to do
is to come back to the
marketplace this year, to look

30:47.279 --> 30:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again to, to shop again. The
hope is that, in some markets,
perhaps in her market, that

30:51.850 --> 30:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are more choices that will
be affordable to her. And they
also are emphasizing the

30:56.922 --> 31:01.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
penalty. We have got to
remember, for example, the first
year, it was $95 or 1 percent of

31:01.226 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your income, whichever
is greater.

31:04.563 --> 31:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That whichever is greater part
really surprised people. For
2016, that goes to $695 or 2.5

31:11.570 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of income. So, while the
administration is emphasizing
they want people to shop on

31:15.907 --> 31:19.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the exchange, they also want to
make it clear that you must have
coverage, unless you meet

31:19.611 --> 31:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hardship exemption and other
exception, and there is a
penalty if you don't sign up.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And people -- and
this -- and people have to
really focus on this. They

31:25.684 --> 31:27.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have got to go online to
get that information.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Exactly.

31:29.287 --> 31:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's look at
another situation. This is a man
named Glenn Alder who lives

31:34.326 --> 31:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Redwood City, California.
Now, he ended up buying private
insurance. He decided for

31:39.431 --> 31:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him that was the smarter thing
to do, rather than the federal
coverage. But he has found

31:43.869 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the cost of premium, co-pays,
deductibles are also rising.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's listen to him.

31:49.775 --> 31:56.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GLENN ALDER, California
Resident: Before Obamacare, my
insurance had a fairly low
deductible,

31:56.681 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had reasonable co-pay amounts,
and the premiums were at about
the same level that they are

32:03.922 --> 32:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. At that point in time, we
had a family deductible of
exactly $3,500. And once we

32:10.428 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fulfilled that deductible, there
were no additional payments
required from the policy.

32:15.500 --> 32:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nowadays, the deductibles are in
the order of $10,000 for a
family. Every year, I see

32:22.474 --> 32:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rates increasing in terms of
premiums, the deductibles going
up, and the co-payments

32:29.648 --> 32:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going up. And out of pocket,
it is costing more and more for
a family, much, much -- at

32:33.852 --> 32:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a much more rapid rate than
the rate of inflation.

32:37.155 --> 32:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes,
what does the administration say
to someone in his situation?

32:41.393 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: They
understand the frustration about
affordability. And they also are
trying

32:45.330 --> 32:50.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make it clear, as he makes it
so clear, that it's not just
about your premium. It's

32:50.335 --> 32:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your deductible, it's your
co-payment, it's this combined
package of expenses that
everyone

32:53.638 --> 32:56.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
faces.

32:56.107 --> 32:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chances are his health plan --
he lives in California -- they
all had to sort of rise

32:59.811 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the level of the plans that
-- the Affordable Care Act had
certain coverages they wanted

33:04.916 --> 33:06.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
covered, so that's probably why
his plan is more expensive. But
consumers have to look

33:06.985 --> 33:09.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the total package.

33:09.421 --> 33:14.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this is where the
frustration comes in, because
that out-of-pocket expense, your
deductibles,

33:14.192 --> 33:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your co-insurance, your co-pays,
are all in addition to those
premiums.

33:18.430 --> 33:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is, of
course, the case with people who
bought into Obamacare,

33:23.134 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the silver plan, for
example. They're having to look
at rising costs as well.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Exactly.

33:28.907 --> 33:33.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The silver plan is -- the second
lowest-cost silver plan is what
they call the benchmark

33:33.311 --> 33:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan. That's what all the
subsidies are tied to. You are
seeing some increases, Oklahoma,

33:36.314 --> 33:40.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for example, an average
increase of 36 percent.

33:40.085 --> 33:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Indiana, there is a decrease
of 13 percent. But the thing
that's important to understand

33:44.089 --> 33:49.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that, even within a state,
even within a region, prices can
vary. So, that's why

33:49.060 --> 33:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's important, even if you like
your current plan, you should
get on healthcare.gov or

33:53.198 --> 33:58.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to a local in-person assister
or a broker, an insurance agent,
and look at what your

33:58.603 --> 34:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
options are to see if you can
make a change that's more
affordable for you if you need

34:00.972 --> 34:03.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So how much
tweaking is the administration
able to do and stay within

34:05.543 --> 34:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the law as it was passed?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: In the sense
of -- what do you mean tweaking?

34:10.282 --> 34:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tweaking in terms
of making adjustments for people
like this. As they

34:15.186 --> 34:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go along, they're finding there
are some challenges that they
didn't recognize originally.

34:18.323 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Sure.

34:20.358 --> 34:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they can do a variety of
things. They're trying to
increase the number of
competitors

34:23.461 --> 34:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the marketplace. That can
certainly help with consumers.
They're trying to make the

34:27.399 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Web site faster and easier, so
when people go on the site, some
of the frustrations,

34:31.636 --> 34:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the screen crashes and
so on, won't be there now.

34:35.740 --> 34:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're trying to make it as
clear as possible for people to
type in their information and

34:39.244 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see their benefits and see their
potential coverages right there.
What does this premium

34:44.382 --> 34:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost? What's my out-of-pocket
cost? What's the total package?
You can rank them from

34:48.586 --> 34:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cheapest to most expensive, to
simply make it easier for you to
find out what's out there.

34:52.791 --> 34:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How confident is
the administration that they're
going to be able to get many

34:56.328 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more people the sign up? When
you talk to them, what is their
expectation? What do they

34:58.129 --> 35:00.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say?

35:00.131 --> 35:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: They're
expecting, of that 10.5 million,
that they can get one in four.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They know, for some people,
simply may not be aware of it,
they don't want to enroll

35:08.606 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in it, they won't do that. Some
people may make the same
calculation as Angela did, that

35:12.444 --> 35:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's too expensive for her.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're trying to go to
those people, who so far have
said no, they do an aggressive

35:19.784 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outreach to try to at least make
them aware of what's out there
and what their options

35:21.720 --> 35:23.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

35:23.621 --> 35:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Mary
Agnes Carey, we are going to
continue this investigation

35:27.525 --> 35:31.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow night with some more
questions as we move into and
approach the third enrollment

35:31.463 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
period for Obamacare.

35:32.163 --> 35:32.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

MARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.

35:37.402 --> 35:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: a tax break
that is coming under fire, one
used by hedge funds and money

35:53.485 --> 35:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
managers, controversial because
of the way profits are taxed at
a much lower rate.

35:58.623 --> 36:03.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, explores what it's
all about, part of our

36:03.161 --> 36:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weekly series Making Sense,
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

36:06.765 --> 36:07.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: Hey, hedge
fund billionaires!

36:07.032 --> 36:07.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Pay your fair share!

36:07.899 --> 36:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hey, hedge fund billionaires,
pay your fair share!

36:09.768 --> 36:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Hedge Clippers,
an activist group targeting
hedge fund billionaires and
especially their

36:23.148 --> 36:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax breaks. In the past few
months, the Clippers have been
taking their tools to their
targets'

36:27.852 --> 36:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backyards, like their March
field trip to Greenwich,
Connecticut.

36:31.589 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Hedge funds, pay
your taxes! Billionaires, pay
your taxes!

36:35.427 --> 36:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Their July jaunt to
the Hamptons, summertime
playground of the 0.1 percent.

36:39.798 --> 36:43.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: We can see
your greedy side.

36:43.334 --> 36:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, earlier this
month, to the Midtown Manhattan
headquarters of Bloomberg,

36:47.639 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where a conference was taking
place to -- quote -- "celebrate
the leaders and innovators who

36:51.242 --> 36:52.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shape economies."

36:52.610 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Pay your fair share.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But not in a
good way, say the Clippers.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTER: These are the
same hedge funds...

36:58.950 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: These are
the same hedge funds...

37:03.421 --> 37:03.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTER: ... that
foreclose on our homes.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: ... that
foreclose on our homes.

37:04.222 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what's
especially galling, says protest
leader Charles Khan, is that

37:08.226 --> 37:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hedge fund managers and private
equity firms get a special tax
break to do so.

37:15.467 --> 37:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES KHAN, Protester: They're
paying less taxes than
kindergarten teachers,
firefighters,

37:19.771 --> 37:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
truck drivers, secretaries.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because of what's
known as the carried interest
loophole.

37:25.743 --> 37:29.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MORRIS PEARL, Patriotic
Millionaires: The term
originated from ship captains
getting

37:29.314 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a 20 percent commission on the
things they carried, so it's
called the carried interest.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Morris Pearl's no
Hedge Clipper, but he's a
kindred soul, having retired
early

37:38.790 --> 37:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Wall Street behemoth
BlackRock to run the Patriotic
Millionaires, a group that's

37:44.329 --> 37:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushing to end tax breaks for
those who have amassed money, or
just inherited it.

37:49.467 --> 37:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORRIS PEARL: I don't see why I
should be paying tax at a lower
rate than other people

37:54.339 --> 37:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I happen to have the
good fortune of being --
frankly, being wealthy enough

37:58.042 --> 38:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to live off my investments,
instead of having to work.

38:00.745 --> 38:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's because the
top income tax rate is almost 40
percent for all earned

38:05.850 --> 38:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
household income above about
$450,000. But the top tax rate
on long-term capital gains,

38:13.191 --> 38:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the profits from sales of
investments like stocks or real
estate owned for more than

38:16.494 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a year, is only 20 percent.

38:20.732 --> 38:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here's the rub: The people
who manage those investments
also get the capital gains

38:25.737 --> 38:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax rate, because of their
supposed carried interest.

38:29.674 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORRIS PEARL: The carried
interest loophole is the most
egregious example of unfairness

38:32.610 --> 38:34.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I have seen.

38:34.946 --> 38:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Egregious, Pearl
thinks because, despite the
argument made by this private

38:38.316 --> 38:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equity video, money managers
aren't risking anything.

38:42.887 --> 38:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, because they form so-called
partnerships with their
investors, they get to cut their

38:47.959 --> 38:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax bill in half by reporting
their share of profits as a
carried interest capital gain.

38:53.831 --> 38:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The industry's rationale? The
managers are investing
something: their effort.

38:59.437 --> 39:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: The private equity
firm contributes sweat equity by
forming the investment fund,

39:04.509 --> 39:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
identifying the companies to buy
and applying expertise to
improve the purchased companies

39:08.713 --> 39:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over time. When the private
equity firm sells a company, its
limited partners receive their

39:14.185 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
initial investment, plus 80
percent of the profits
thereafter.

39:18.656 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The remaining 20 percent of the
profits goes to the private
equity firm. This is called

39:22.493 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a carried interest.

39:24.996 --> 39:30.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, according to
Patriotic Millionaire Whitney
Tilson, money managers like him
already

39:30.468 --> 39:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take whopping fees, and the
share of profits is really no
different.

39:34.839 --> 39:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHITNEY TILSON, Kase Capital
Management: I'm just taking a 20
percent bonus, just like

39:39.010 --> 39:45.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the shoe salesman at Nordstrom's
getting a bonus at the end of
the year. So, why should

39:45.083 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I be paying a much lower tax
rate than an average guy earning
a bonus? It makes no sense.

39:50.088 --> 39:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Fellow hedge funder
Jim Chanos puts it more
colloquially.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM CHANOS, Kynikos Associates:
It's complete baloney.
Economically, I can tell you, as

39:55.860 --> 39:58.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
someone in the industry,
there is no basis for it.

39:58.930 --> 40:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the private
equity industry says, we
streamline businesses, we
reorganize

40:04.068 --> 40:10.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them, we make them more
productive. So, you want to tax
us at a low rate in order to
facilitate

40:10.608 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our rebuilding of
corporate America.

40:14.445 --> 40:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM CHANOS: And that's fine.
That's great if it happens. But
if you earn a fee for doing

40:20.151 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, that's actually
ordinary income.

40:23.888 --> 40:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN ELLIS, Americans for Tax
Reform: It's not ordinary
income, and it shouldn't be
taxed

40:24.489 --> 40:26.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that way.

40:26.624 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: After all, argues
Ryan Ellis of Grover Norquist's
Americans for Tax Reform,

40:30.428 --> 40:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is all perfectly legal.

40:33.665 --> 40:38.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tried unsuccessfully to find
a money manager to defend the
carried interest tax break.

40:38.403 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN ELLIS: Under our system of
partnership law, you do not have
to invest money personally

40:42.440 --> 40:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in order to derive a capital
gain from the partnership.

40:45.777 --> 40:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Public policy is all about, do
we want to have flexible
partnership arrangements that

40:50.648 --> 40:55.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
allow for investment
partnerships to develop, allow
for the successful business
arrangement

40:55.887 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to happen, and that treats
capital gains as they're
supposed to be treated, capital
gains?

41:00.391 --> 41:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ellis uses an
argument the private equity
industry makes in its video.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN ELLIS: Let's say you have
two people that want to buy a
restaurant, and one of

41:07.865 --> 41:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them is a brilliant chef and he
will make the restaurant work,
but he has no money to

41:11.903 --> 41:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
invest? And then you have a
money investor. They go 50/50 on
this restaurant. They eventually

41:15.807 --> 41:19.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sell the restaurant. Are you
telling me the brilliant chef
shouldn't benefit from the

41:19.444 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capital gain, that he should pay
ordinary income tax on that,
that he put nothing into

41:21.346 --> 41:22.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

41:22.780 --> 41:26.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Morris Pearl
doesn't buy the sweat equity
argument.

41:26.551 --> 41:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORRIS PEARL: Everyone else
invests their labor in making
money. I don't see any reason

41:30.655 --> 41:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why this small group of people,
who happen to be hedge fund
managers, should pay lower

41:34.826 --> 41:38.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
taxes on their labor
than everyone else pays.

41:38.162 --> 41:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Pearl is sure
partnership law wasn't written
to be exploited by money
managers.

41:43.568 --> 41:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, there's a bill now
in Congress to exclude carried
interest as capital gains.

41:50.408 --> 41:56.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has the staunchly anti-tax
Ryan Ellis worried, that it will
embolden tax hikers

41:56.447 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go after the capital gains
tax break next, and who knows
what else.

42:00.785 --> 42:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN ELLIS: This is the camel's
nose under the tent, this is the
tip of the spear, this

42:03.821 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the Trojan horse. Whatever
metaphor you want to use, that's
what actually going on

42:06.057 --> 42:07.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

42:07.992 --> 42:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it is populism at its
worst and ugliest, because what
it's doing is picking out a very

42:12.063 --> 42:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small slice of Americans that
earn long-term capital gains and
saying, for you and only

42:17.935 --> 42:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, we're going to raise your
taxes and tax you as ordinary
income. It's pitting Americans

42:21.406 --> 42:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against each other. That's
absolute class warfare.

42:24.942 --> 42:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: We have
seen a proliferation of
millionaires

42:27.245 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and billionaires.

42:29.113 --> 42:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And on the campaign
trail this fall, the camel has
sounded surprisingly bipartisan.

42:35.820 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton are against the carried
interest tax break, of course,

42:39.323 --> 42:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but even some Republicans have
spears in their tax plans.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: The hedge fund guys
won't like me as much

42:45.963 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as they like me right now. I
know them all, but they'll pay
more. I know people that are

42:50.334 --> 42:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making a tremendous amount of
money and paying virtually no
tax, and I think it's unfair.

42:54.071 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is the carried
interest tax break toast?

42:57.108 --> 43:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHITNEY TILSON: I think, at
best, 50/50 chance that anything
changes in the next couple of

43:01.312 --> 43:03.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

43:03.014 --> 43:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The only plausible
hypothesis here is that people
who have a major interest

43:08.653 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the carried interest
deduction are influencing
politicians to not end it.

43:14.992 --> 43:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM CHANOS: I know that sounds
shocking, but yes. Anybody with
any sense of fairness in

43:19.397 --> 43:26.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax policy would argue that it
shouldn't exist, and yet it
hangs on.

43:26.337 --> 43:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which is why the
Hedge Clippers will probably be
back in Connecticut again

43:29.740 --> 43:32.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
before long.

43:32.944 --> 43:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting for the
"PBS NewsHour" from the

43:37.048 --> 43:43.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front in the war over the
carried interest tax break.

43:43.120 --> 43:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the latest
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf, reflections on a

43:53.831 --> 43:57.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lifelong search to belong.

House of My Own: Stories From My
Life."

44:04.375 --> 44:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She sat down to talk with
Jeffrey Brown recently at the
Mexican Cultural Institute here
in

44:08.212 --> 44:09.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sandra
Cisneros, welcome to you.

SANDRA CISNEROS, Author, "A
House of My Own: Stories From My
Life": Thank you.

44:13.050 --> 44:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this is an
unusual kind of memoir. You have
gathered up old writings,

44:17.021 --> 44:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then you ask yourself, as
you say in the introduction, who
wrote these and why? I have

44:21.425 --> 44:25.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a need to know, so that I
can understand my life.

44:25.062 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Well, I was
trying to gather my essays from
B.C., before computers.

44:29.634 --> 44:32.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Before computers.

44:32.136 --> 44:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes, because I
lose things. I write things and
they disappear from my

44:35.907 --> 44:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
desk, my life. I move a lot.

44:39.410 --> 44:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to gather them and put
them under one roof, under one
cover, so I could document

44:44.849 --> 44:48.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my life in a series
of snapshots.

44:48.252 --> 44:53.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you see
when you looked back? Did you
recognize that person?

44:53.157 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes and no. I
saw someone who was very
innocent and trusting and
believed

44:57.762 --> 45:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything family told her. So,
I was a little more suspicious
now. And, like everyone, I

45:03.267 --> 45:05.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
change my mind.

45:05.670 --> 45:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You come from the
kind of conservative
Mexican-American family in
Chicago. It's interesting

45:11.742 --> 45:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that so many of these stories do
involve travels and leaving, and
yet the main theme and even

45:17.248 --> 45:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the title house, right, home.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes.

45:21.953 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, when you're an immigrant
writer, or an immigrant, you're
not always welcome to

45:28.526 --> 45:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country unless you're the
right immigrant. If you have a
Mexican accent, people look

45:32.830 --> 45:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at you like, you know, where do
you come from and why don't you
go back to where you came

45:35.232 --> 45:37.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from?

45:37.201 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even though I was born in
the United States, I never felt
at home in the United States.

45:43.741 --> 45:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I never felt at home until I
moved to the Southwest, where,
you know, there's a mix

45:48.913 --> 45:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my culture with the U.S.
culture, and that was why I
lived in Texas for 25 years.

45:54.986 --> 45:58.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that
unsettledness, though, comes
through in these essays, these
vignettes,

45:58.489 --> 45:59.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these Polaroids that
you talked about.

45:59.657 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes. Yes.

46:01.325 --> 46:05.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you're
always sort of -- you're
crossing borders. You're living

46:05.262 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in different homes that
aren't quite home.

46:07.498 --> 46:10.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDRA CISNEROS: That's
right. That's right.

46:10.167 --> 46:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was only when I arrived
at a landscape in the Southwest
with the big skies, like

46:16.040 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the old black-and-white
Mexican movies, that I felt,
yes, this feels like home, when

46:20.711 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard Spanish alongside
English, that I said, this feels
like home. And even now,

46:25.416 --> 46:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I live in a town where you hear
English as much as you hear
Spanish. I live in San Miguel

46:28.653 --> 46:30.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
de Allende.

46:30.388 --> 46:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to come
back to San Miguel, but, first,
I want to ask you about

46:33.691 --> 46:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the house, the original house of
your writing career, "The House
on Mango Street," which

46:39.563 --> 46:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of set you on your way,
right? Did it also define and
confine you?

46:45.536 --> 46:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Well, you know
what? People know me from my
first book, but I don't mind

46:49.774 --> 46:53.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that. That's my child.
That's my first-born child.

46:53.210 --> 46:58.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have written many other
books since then, and people
love my first-born child,

46:58.382 --> 47:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's been around on the
planet longer than others, so
people have had more time

47:04.689 --> 47:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work with that one. And I
don't feel restricted or
constricted with that book.

47:09.360 --> 47:15.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel as if it's my eldest
child and he went to work and is
earning money for his mom,

47:15.499 --> 47:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's perfectly fine, so I
can take care of the other kids.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:18.169 --> 47:19.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's a
good child to have. Right?

47:19.470 --> 47:21.739 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDRA CISNEROS:
It's a good child.

47:21.739 --> 47:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're also in
these essays very candid about
traumas along the way,
depression,

47:28.446 --> 47:33.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even after the great success of
"The House on Mango Street." So
it wasn't an easy road.

47:33.150 --> 47:35.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDRA CISNEROS: No.

47:35.486 --> 47:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people think that "House"
was an overnight success, but
that night was a 10-year night.

47:39.090 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
along the way?

47:42.093 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: A lot of
doubts, a lot of sadnesses,
because I didn't have things
that

47:46.697 --> 47:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other people had. I didn't have
the car or the health insurance
or the house that other

47:51.736 --> 47:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people had. There was a lot of
doubts of whether I was making
the right choices.

47:55.906 --> 48:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't marry. I didn't have
children. I followed the food
supply for jobs. I kept

48:02.246 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing at night. And that kept
me moving. It kept my life
disruptive. It broke up many

48:07.284 --> 48:10.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationships. Was
it worth it? Yes.

48:10.488 --> 48:12.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:12.356 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I mean,
that's actually what -- that's
the totality of your documents,

48:17.661 --> 48:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the life of a writer or the
writer that you became.

48:20.998 --> 48:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Well, I didn't
intend to be writing -- the
writer's life. I was just

48:24.969 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing what came to me at the
time, but it is a map of how
this writer had to break many

48:33.611 --> 48:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
barriers to find, not a room of
her own, but a house of her own.

48:38.849 --> 48:43.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And where did
that ambition come from, to make
a life as a writer?

48:43.254 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: You know, I
think I didn't know what I was
creating, as much as I knew

48:47.424 --> 48:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what I didn't want to do. And I
didn't want my mother's life.
She was an unhappy, frustrated

48:52.797 --> 48:59.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
artist who always dreamed of a
life that was never going to be
hers.

48:59.436 --> 49:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't want to be married with
seven kids and wish, oh, if only
I had done this. I didn't

49:06.010 --> 49:11.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want that. So, my dream was to
mother a book. That was first
and foremost since I was 11

49:11.982 --> 49:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years old. And I just didn't
know how to do that, because no
one in my family had any

49:16.420 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
connections or a clue of how to
do that, so I just kind of
fumbled my way through it.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now
you are in Mexico.

49:23.928 --> 49:26.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes, I'm
living the writer's life.

49:26.163 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Crossing the
border, living a writer's life
in Mexico, but crossing the

49:29.066 --> 49:30.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
border back.

49:30.034 --> 49:32.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Yes.

49:32.469 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, my ancestors were from
there. A hundred years ago, they
fled in the 1915, during the

49:40.444 --> 49:47.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revolution. And 100 years later,
I have meandered back. I like to
think they called me back.

49:47.117 --> 49:53.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like to think that my
entire life was leading up to
this moment of me moving back

49:53.724 --> 50:00.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and being reborn, because it's
kind of like a rebirth, to be
back there and walking the

50:00.297 --> 50:04.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
streets that possibly grand
ancestors walked. It's really
great.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

50:06.036 --> 50:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The new book is "A House of My
Own: Stories From My Life."

50:09.473 --> 50:15.079 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Sandra Cisneros,
thank you so much.

50:15.079 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDRA CISNEROS: Thank you.

50:20.918 --> 50:25.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that might
be

50:25.656 --> 50:28.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:28.926 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local PBS station WGBH Boston
found this doctor, on the
street, showing his moves to
raise

50:34.098 --> 50:37.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money for charity.

50:37.368 --> 50:45.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN, WGBH: He's not
exactly Michael Jackson, or even
Tito, Dr. Adnan Khera has

50:45.542 --> 50:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the moves that draw a crowd
everywhere he goes. He's an
anesthesiologist at Tufts
Medical

50:49.280 --> 50:53.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Center, and a dancing sensation.

50:53.550 --> 50:57.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We followed Dr. Khera to
downtown Crossing, where he set
up shop to dance for charity.

50:57.588 --> 51:00.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ADNAN KHERA, Tufts Medical
Center: What I want to do is
kind of spread the idea that

51:00.724 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
individuals can make a
difference and it's basically
through embracing something that

51:03.427 --> 51:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're passionate about anyways
and use it in a way that is
positive.

51:06.797 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: And how did
you come up with the idea?

51:11.769 --> 51:15.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ADNAN KHERA: The idea
originally came up when I was
visiting Barcelona and saw --
there

51:15.839 --> 51:18.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a lot -- there's a huge
street performing culture in
Barcelona, and basically I got

51:18.475 --> 51:20.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of ideas in my head.

51:20.511 --> 51:30.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Part of his big
idea, a white coat, a boom box
and a sign.

51:30.354 --> 51:37.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much did you raise the
first time you danced?

51:37.027 --> 51:41.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ADNAN KHERA: The first time
I danced, I raised, I think,
$245, roughly.

51:41.765 --> 51:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Two hundred and
forty-five dollars has grown to
about $12,000 since May. He's

51:46.303 --> 51:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
given to dozens of charities.

51:52.743 --> 51:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question about Dr.
Khera's commitment or his
stamina. He boogied for two
hours straight

51:57.114 --> 52:00.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while we were there, and does
it several times a week.

52:00.617 --> 52:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: He's looking good. You know
what I mean? Dripping some
sweat, never a bad thing.

52:04.321 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The money poured in
and some were even inspired to
get into the groove.

52:08.392 --> 52:12.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Why not? Dancing's fun. He
looks like he's having fun. I
went to give him a dollar

52:12.763 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
donation, so I just couldn't
help myself, actually.

52:17.167 --> 52:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Whether people
gave, danced or just watched,
it's clear they noticed.

52:22.106 --> 52:27.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ADNAN KHERA: A lot of people
come up and just tell me I'm
doing a great job or that

52:27.978 --> 52:32.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm kind of doing the community
a huge service. And that kind of
goes a long way.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was Tina Martin of WGBH.

52:33.450 --> 52:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we could do that, yes.

52:33.951 --> 52:36.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He was
wearing his scrubs, right?

52:36.487 --> 52:39.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We can do it. We
don't need scrubs. We can just
break -- bust a move.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
