00:16.817 --> 00:18.685

00:18.685 --> 00:20.020
COLORADO'S LEGALIZATION OF

00:20.020 --> 00:21.388
MARIJUANA HAS ANGERED SOME OF

00:21.388 --> 00:22.489
ITS NEIGHBORS.

00:22.489 --> 00:23.624
NOW THEY'RE SUING TO KEEP IT

00:23.624 --> 00:24.358
OUT.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.425
>> NEBRASKA DIDN'T ASK TO

00:25.425 --> 00:26.526
LEGALIZE IT.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.761
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL HERE.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.562
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.897
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.153
JORDAN TO HELP IN THE WAR

01:26.153 --> 01:27.454
AGAINST ISIS.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.222
JORDAN HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AIR

01:29.222 --> 01:30.557
STRIKES AGAINST THE ISLAMIC

01:30.557 --> 01:31.825
EXTREMISTS SINCE A JORDANIAN

PILOT WAS BURNED ALIVE.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.495
ITS MUNITIONS ARE SAID TO BE

01:35.495 --> 01:37.197
STRETCHED THIN.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.237
GOVERNMENT AND PRO-RUSSIAN

01:44.237 --> 01:45.973
REBELS WENT INTO EFFECT.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.240
THE UNITED STATES AND UKRAINE

01:47.240 --> 01:48.942
BOTH ACCUSE RUSSIA OF DEPLOYING

01:48.942 --> 01:50.811
ARTILLERY AND SHELLING UKRAINIAN

01:50.811 --> 01:52.479
POSITIONS IN THE HOURS LEADING

01:52.479 --> 01:54.014
UP TO THE CEASE-FIRE.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.315
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT PETRO

01:55.315 --> 01:57.584
POROSHENKO SAID TODAY HE STILL

01:57.584 --> 01:59.219
WANTS A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF

01:59.219 --> 02:00.887
THE CONFLICT, BUT HE THREATENED

02:00.887 --> 02:02.422
TO IMPOSE MARTIAL LAW IN THE

02:02.422 --> 02:03.357
AREA.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.192
AND HE ADDED THIS:

02:05.192 --> 02:06.493

02:08.595 --> 02:09.896
EITHER THE ENEMY STOPS SHOOTING

02:09.896 --> 02:11.665
AND EMBARKS ON DE-ESCALATION AND

02:11.665 --> 02:13.700
THEN POLITICAL RESOLUTION, OR

02:13.700 --> 02:15.235
THE ENEMY ESCALATES THE CONFLICT

02:15.235 --> 02:17.237
FOR US AND FOR EUROPE AND THE

02:17.237 --> 02:18.605
WHOLE WORLD.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.306
>> Stewart: AT THE VATICAN

02:19.306 --> 02:20.974
TODAY, IN A CEREMONY AT SAINT

02:24.911 --> 02:26.146
FROM EUROPE AND NONE FROM THE

02:26.146 --> 02:27.280
UNITED STATES.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.648
MOST OF THOSE CARDINALS ARE FROM

02:28.648 --> 02:30.150
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AROUND THE

02:30.150 --> 02:31.084
WORLD.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.352
THE POPE'S SELECTIONS ARE SEEN

02:32.352 --> 02:33.854
AS PART OF HIS ONGOING EFFORTS

02:33.854 --> 02:35.088
TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF POWER

02:35.088 --> 02:37.724
IN THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP.

02:37.724 --> 02:38.959
CLOSER TO HOME, AUTHORITIES IN

02:38.959 --> 02:40.427
NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA, HAVE

02:40.427 --> 02:41.528
CHARGED TWO PEOPLE WITH

02:41.528 --> 02:43.063
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER

02:43.063 --> 02:45.165

02:45.165 --> 02:46.566
A MASS SHOOTING IN HALIFAX

02:46.566 --> 02:47.501

02:47.501 --> 02:49.036
OFFICIALS THERE SAY THE PLANNED

02:49.036 --> 02:50.237
ATTACK WAS NOT "CULTURALLY

02:50.237 --> 02:51.638
BASED" AND SAID "THERE IS

02:51.638 --> 02:52.939
NOTHING IN THE INVESTIGATION TO

02:52.939 --> 02:54.474
CLASSIFY IT AS A POSSIBLE

02:54.474 --> 02:55.876
TERRORIST ATTACK."

02:55.876 --> 02:56.977
THEY DID NOT SAY WHAT DID

02:56.977 --> 02:58.278
MOTIVATE THE PLAN.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.946
ONE OF THOSE ARRESTED WAS A 23-

02:59.946 --> 03:01.715
YEAR-OLD ILLINOIS WOMAN.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.582
POLICE IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, ARE

03:02.582 --> 03:04.084
INVESTIGATING ARSON AS A

03:04.084 --> 03:06.053
POSSIBLE CAUSE OF A FIRE AT AN

03:06.053 --> 03:07.988
ISLAMIC CENTER THERE YESTERDAY.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.523
THE FIRE, WHICH BEGAN BEFORE

03:11.058 --> 03:12.626
HOUR AND DESTROYED ONE OF THREE

03:12.626 --> 03:14.628
BUILDINGS ON THE COMPLEX.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.896
THE TEXAS STATE HISTORICAL

ASSOCIATION SAY TEXAS HAS THE

03:17.898 --> 03:19.466
EIGHTH LARGEST MUSLIM POPULATION

03:19.466 --> 03:21.234
IN THE UNITED STATES, ABOUT

03:21.234 --> 03:23.537
420,000 PEOPLE.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.439
THE FAMILY OF AN UNARMED MAN

03:25.439 --> 03:26.940
SHOT DEAD EARLIER THIS WEEK BY

03:26.940 --> 03:28.642
POLICE IN WASHINGTON STATE HAS

03:28.642 --> 03:30.944
FILED A $25 MILLION WRONGFUL

03:30.944 --> 03:32.913
DEATH LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY

03:32.913 --> 03:34.047
OF PASCO.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.682
THIS, AS THE COUNTY CORONER

03:35.682 --> 03:37.284
ORDERED AN INQUEST INTO THE

03:37.284 --> 03:38.752
SHOOTING, WHICH WAS CAPTURED ON

03:38.752 --> 03:40.187
VIDEO BY A MOTORIST.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.555
THE POLICE SAY THE MAN WHO WAS

03:41.555 --> 03:42.656
KILLED HAD BEEN THROWING ROCKS

03:42.656 --> 03:44.191
AT THEM AND REFUSED TO STOP WHEN

03:44.191 --> 03:45.792
THEY TRIED TO ARREST HIM.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.227
THE INCIDENT LED TO PROTESTS IN

03:47.227 --> 03:49.196
THE CITY ABOUT 215 MILES

03:49.196 --> 03:51.164
SOUTHEAST OF SEATTLE.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.566
AND THE UNITED STATES COULD BE

03:52.566 --> 03:54.201
IN FOR WHAT NASA IS DESCRIBING

03:54.201 --> 03:55.702
AS THE WORST DROUGHT IN A

03:55.702 --> 03:57.771
THOUSAND YEARS, WHAT IT CALLS A

03:57.771 --> 03:58.872
"MEGA-DROUGHT."

03:58.872 --> 04:00.373
THE NASA STUDY WARNS THAT IF

04:00.373 --> 04:01.475
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

04:01.475 --> 04:03.009
CONTINUE TO INCREASE, IT'S

04:03.009 --> 04:04.644
LIKELY THE SOUTHWEST AND CENTRAL

04:04.644 --> 04:05.979
PLAINS WILL SEE A DROUGHT

04:05.979 --> 04:08.348
STARTING AS EARLY AS 2050 AND

04:08.348 --> 04:09.950
THAT COULD LAST DECADES, A

04:09.950 --> 04:11.151
DROUGHT THAT NASA WARNS WILL

04:11.151 --> 04:12.953
PRODUCE WATER SHORTAGES FAR

04:12.953 --> 04:15.222
WORSE THAN THE CURRENT DROUGHT.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.065
>> Stewart: AMERICAN AND AFGHAN

04:25.065 --> 04:26.199
COMMANDOS HAVE SHARPLY

04:26.199 --> 04:27.801
INTENSIFIED RAIDS AGAINST AL

04:27.801 --> 04:29.669
QAEDA AFTER KILLING AN AL QAEDA

04:29.669 --> 04:31.304
LEADER LAST FALL AND SEIZING HIS

04:31.304 --> 04:32.305
COMPUTER.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.240
IT CONTAINED VALUABLE

04:33.240 --> 04:34.674
INFORMATION ABOUT AL QAEDA'S

04:34.674 --> 04:36.510
OPERATIONS IN BOTH AFGHANISTAN

04:36.510 --> 04:38.211
AND PAKISTAN.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.446
FOR MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS,

04:39.446 --> 04:40.547
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY MATTHEW

04:40.547 --> 04:41.815
ROSENBERG OF THE "NEW YORK

04:41.815 --> 04:42.582
TIMES."

04:42.582 --> 04:43.583
HE CO-AUTHORED THE STORY

04:43.583 --> 04:45.118
DETAILING ALL OF THIS.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.319
SO, WHAT WAS ON THIS LAPTOP,

04:46.319 --> 04:47.754
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION, AND

04:47.754 --> 04:49.923
WHAT IMPACT HAS IT HAD ON U.S.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.957
MILITARY INVOLVEMENT ON THE

04:50.957 --> 04:51.725
GROUND?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.093
>> WE'RE TOLD THAT IT WAS QUITE

04:53.093 --> 04:54.294
AN EXTENSIVE KIND OF ACCOUNTING

04:54.294 --> 04:57.164
OF AL QAEDA OPERATIONS.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.198
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE PRETTY

04:58.198 --> 04:59.499
TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT THESE KIND OF

04:59.499 --> 05:00.133
THINGS.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.301
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF

05:01.301 --> 05:02.502
DATA ON THERE THAT ALLOWED THEM

05:02.502 --> 05:03.537
TO KEEP TRACK OF PEOPLE.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.437
IT MAY HAVE BEEN OPERATIONAL.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.006
IT COULD'VE BEEN PHONE NUMBERS.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.041
AL QAEDA KEEPS AMAZING RECORDS

05:08.041 --> 05:08.808
OF WHAT IT DOES.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.243
A LOT OF THESE MILITANT

05:10.243 --> 05:11.444
ORGANIZATIONS DO.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.445
AND EVEN THINGS LIKE A PHONE

05:12.445 --> 05:14.414
LIST CAN PROVIDE HUGE

05:14.414 --> 05:15.315
INTELLIGENCE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

05:15.315 --> 05:17.184
TRACK PEOPLE DOWN.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.652
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S ALSO

05:18.652 --> 05:19.419
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THERE WERE

05:19.419 --> 05:20.854
OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY HERE.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.355
A NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT WAS

05:22.355 --> 05:24.024
SUDDENLY MORE OPEN TO WORKING

05:24.024 --> 05:26.193
WITH THE U.S.; AND, YOU KNOW,

05:26.193 --> 05:27.861
THE AFGHAN ARMY HAD A REALLY

05:27.861 --> 05:28.895
ROUGH TIME LAST YEAR, AND THE

05:28.895 --> 05:29.930
AMERICANS REALLY WANT TO KEEP

05:29.930 --> 05:30.931
HELPING THEM.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.065
ONE OF THE BIGGER THINGS THEY'VE

05:32.065 --> 05:33.166
BEEN ABLE TO DO TO HELP IS TO GO

05:33.166 --> 05:34.367
AFTER THE MID-LEVEL COMMANDERS

05:34.367 --> 05:35.669
OF THE INSURGENCY.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.803
AND, YOU KNOW, THE AL QAEDA

05:36.803 --> 05:37.904
GUYS, WHILE NOT DIRECTLY PART OF

05:37.904 --> 05:39.239
THE TALIBAN, THEY DO OFTEN AID

05:39.239 --> 05:40.807
THE TALIBAN, PROVIDE A KIND OF

05:40.807 --> 05:41.775
EXPERTISE.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.676
>> Stewart: SOMETHING, MATTHEW,

05:42.676 --> 05:43.743
I FIND SO FASCINATING ABOUT THIS

05:43.743 --> 05:45.212
STORY-- ALMOST THE "GEE WHIZ"

05:45.212 --> 05:48.048
OF IT-- IS THAT A COMPUTER HAS

05:48.048 --> 05:50.717
BEEN SO USEFUL; GIVEN ALL THE

05:50.717 --> 05:51.751
MILITARY MIGHT AND ALL THE POWER

05:51.751 --> 05:52.852
WE HAVE AND ALL THE

05:52.852 --> 05:54.221
INTELLIGENCE, THAT ONE PIECE OF

05:54.221 --> 05:55.488
EQUIPMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE SO

05:55.488 --> 05:56.823
VALUABLE.

05:56.823 --> 05:57.624
>> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

05:57.624 --> 06:00.160
THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD IN FIGHTING

06:00.160 --> 06:02.162
THE TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA TO A

06:02.162 --> 06:05.298
DEGREE IS GETTING PEOPLE INSIDE.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.199
THE TALIBAN'S LEADERSHIP IS A

06:06.199 --> 06:07.767
GROUP OF VILLAGERS WHO ALL GREW

06:07.767 --> 06:08.702
UP TOGETHER.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.303
GETTING PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE TO

06:10.303 --> 06:11.438
FEED INFORMATION, VERY

06:11.438 --> 06:12.372
DIFFICULT.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.807
AL QAEDA, THE SAME THING.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.975
THEY'RE IN DISTANT AREAS.

06:14.975 --> 06:19.145
THEY ARE VERY CLOSE ABOUT WHO

06:19.145 --> 06:20.680
THEY LET INTO THE INNER CIRCLE.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.115
SO, SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER

06:22.115 --> 06:23.383
CAN PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

06:23.383 --> 06:24.918
OF INSIGHT INTO WHAT'S GOING ON,

06:24.918 --> 06:25.919
EVEN IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF

06:25.919 --> 06:27.287
RECORDS OF WHO BOUGHT WHAT, WHEN

06:27.287 --> 06:28.989
AND WHERE-- YOU KNOW, PRINTER

06:28.989 --> 06:31.224
CARTRIDGES, TELEPHONES, WHO

06:31.224 --> 06:31.825
KNOWS.

06:31.825 --> 06:32.559
>> Stewart: ONE OF THE AFGHAN

06:32.559 --> 06:33.860
OFFICIALS QUOTED IN THE STORY

06:33.860 --> 06:35.695
THAT YOU CO-AUTHORED SAID THIS

06:35.695 --> 06:38.565
IS A "SECRET WAR," THESE RAIDS.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.399
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN

06:39.399 --> 06:40.333
TWO WARS GOING ON IN

06:40.333 --> 06:40.934
AFGHANISTAN.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.835
THERE'S THE KIND OF BIG ARMY,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.503
PUBLIC WAR THE EMBEDS, THE

06:43.503 --> 06:44.704
JOURNALISTS LIKE MYSELF AND

06:44.704 --> 06:46.339
OTHERS WENT AROUND AND WE SAW;

06:46.339 --> 06:47.607
AND THEN THERE WAS THE SECRET

06:47.607 --> 06:49.142
WAR-- NIGHT RAIDS, CLANDESTINE

06:49.142 --> 06:51.177
OPERATIONS-- THAT WENT AFTER

06:51.177 --> 06:52.679
INSURGENT LEADERS, INSURGENT

06:52.679 --> 06:53.913
FINANCES.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.081
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER GOT A CLOSE

06:55.081 --> 06:55.849
LOOK AT THAT.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.450
AND THE BIG WAR IS OVER.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.819
I MEAN, THOSE DAYS OF BIG U.S.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.688
TROOPS OCCUPYING BASES AROUND

07:01.688 --> 07:03.456
THE COUNTRY, THAT'S DONE.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.658
BUT THAT SECRET WAR, THAT

07:04.658 --> 07:06.593
CLANDESTINE WAR IS STILL VERY

07:06.593 --> 07:07.460
MUCH GOING.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.228
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S

07:08.228 --> 07:09.329
ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE IS THAT

07:09.329 --> 07:10.930
WE'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT

07:10.930 --> 07:12.198
DECLARING THE WAR OVER-- I THINK

07:12.198 --> 07:13.466
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

07:13.466 --> 07:14.768
HE SAID IN THE STATE OF THE

07:14.768 --> 07:15.702
UNION-- BUT THERE ARE AMERICANS

07:15.702 --> 07:16.436
WHO ARE STILL VERY MUCH INVOLVED

07:16.436 --> 07:18.138
TO A DEGREE IN COMBAT IN

07:18.138 --> 07:19.139
AFGHANISTAN.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.006
>> Stewart: AND IS THAT WHY BOTH

07:20.006 --> 07:21.374
SIDES-- AMERICAN AND AFGHAN

07:21.374 --> 07:22.742
SIDE-- HAVE KEPT THIS RELATIVELY

07:22.742 --> 07:23.576
QUIET?

07:23.576 --> 07:24.944
>> I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.813
THERE IS SOME NECESSITY FOR

07:26.813 --> 07:28.415
OPERATIONAL SECRECY, AND WE ALL

07:28.415 --> 07:29.149
UNDERSTAND THAT.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.450
AND I THINK THERE'S THE ISSUE OF

07:30.450 --> 07:31.985
POLITICAL FALLOUT AT HOME.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.586
IN THE U.S., YOU KNOW, ON A

07:33.586 --> 07:36.156
RANGE OF ISSUES-- THIS, ON DATA

07:36.156 --> 07:37.557
RELEASED BY THE MILITARY ABOUT

07:37.557 --> 07:38.792
WHAT'S GOING ON IN AFGHANISTAN--

07:38.792 --> 07:39.726
THERE JUST IS LESS AND LESS

07:39.726 --> 07:41.161
AVAILABLE, AND THE IMPRESSION WE

07:41.161 --> 07:42.762
HAVE IS EVERYBODY WANTS TO KIND

07:42.762 --> 07:43.930
OF FORGET ABOUT IT.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.298
ON THE AFGHAN SIDE, THE IMAGE OF

07:45.298 --> 07:46.700
AMERICANS STILL RAIDING AFGHAN

07:46.700 --> 07:48.201
HOMES AT NIGHT, EVEN IF THEY'RE

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
DOING IT WITH AFGHAN TROOPS, IS

07:50.103 --> 07:52.138
JUST NOT A GOOD IMAGE THAT

07:52.138 --> 07:53.306
ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE AND ANY

07:53.306 --> 07:54.674
LEADER THERE WANTS OUT IN

07:54.674 --> 07:55.408
PUBLIC.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.176
>> Stewart: MATTHEW ROSENBERG

07:56.176 --> 07:57.210
FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THANK

07:57.210 --> 07:58.712
YOU FOR SHARING YOUR REPORTING.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.413
>> THANK YOU.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.256
>> Stewart: AND NOW TO OUR

08:10.256 --> 08:11.791
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, OUR ORIGINAL

08:11.791 --> 08:13.193
IN-DEPTH REPORTS FROM AROUND THE

08:13.193 --> 08:14.928
NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.296
YOU NO DOUBT HAVE HEARD A GREAT

08:16.296 --> 08:17.397
DEAL ABOUT COLORADO'S

08:17.397 --> 08:19.366
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND

08:19.366 --> 08:20.600
HOW SALES THERE ARE PRODUCING

08:20.600 --> 08:22.068
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

08:22.068 --> 08:23.436
TAX REVENUES.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.038
WHAT YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD

08:25.038 --> 08:26.539
ABOUT IS THE IMPACT COLORADO'S

08:26.539 --> 08:28.074
DECISION HAS HAD ON NEIGHBORING

08:28.074 --> 08:29.242
STATES.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.710
HERE'S A HINT: AUTHORITIES IN

08:30.710 --> 08:32.312
THOSE OTHER STATES ARE NOT VERY

08:32.312 --> 08:33.213
HAPPY.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.647
IN FACT, SO UNHAPPY THAT SOME OF

08:34.647 --> 08:36.649
THEM HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.851
I RECENTLY TRAVELED TO WESTERN

08:37.851 --> 08:39.052
NEBRASKA, NEAR THE COLORADO

08:39.052 --> 08:40.820
STATE LINE, TO SEE HOW THE STORY

08:40.820 --> 08:44.357
IS PLAYING OUT THERE.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.725
ADAM HAYWARD IS THE SHERIFF OF

08:45.725 --> 08:47.660
DEUEL COUNTY, NEBRASKA, WHICH IS

08:47.660 --> 08:48.962
RIGHT BY THE STATE LINE WITH

08:48.962 --> 08:50.230
COLORADO.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.698
SHERIFF HAYWARD SAYS HIS WORK

08:51.698 --> 08:52.866
HAS NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE

08:52.866 --> 08:54.834
COLORADO LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL

08:54.834 --> 08:56.102
MARIJUANA.

08:56.102 --> 08:56.936
>> KEEP IT OVER THERE.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.305
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL HERE.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.106
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.541
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.675
>> Stewart: THE SHERIFF SAYS

09:02.675 --> 09:03.810
HE'S ARRESTED ALL SORTS OF

09:03.810 --> 09:04.844
PEOPLE CARRYING MARIJUANA BACK

09:04.844 --> 09:06.746
FROM COLORADO ALONG INTERSTATE

09:06.746 --> 09:09.215
76-- TEENAGERS MAKING WEEKEND

09:09.215 --> 09:11.418
RUNS TO DENVER, AND, ONCE, A 67-

09:11.418 --> 09:12.619
YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.087
WITH EACH ARREST, THE SHERIFF

09:14.087 --> 09:15.088
COLLECTS MORE AND MORE

09:15.088 --> 09:16.322
MARIJUANA.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.457
IT IS CATALOGED AND THEN STORED

09:17.457 --> 09:19.692
IN THE DEUEL COUNTY JAIL CELL.

09:19.692 --> 09:20.960
>> NOW WE KEEP ALL OUR EVIDENCE

09:20.960 --> 09:21.561
HERE.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.796
>> Stewart: WHICH YOU CAN SMELL.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.330
>> YES.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.331
ALL THESE TRASH BAGS, THESE

09:25.331 --> 09:27.801
TOTES, THIS, THESE WERE ALL OUT

09:27.801 --> 09:29.536
OF ONE STOP WE HAD.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.037
>> Stewart: THAT WAS ONE STOP?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.573
>> THERE WERE 75 POUNDS THAT

09:33.573 --> 09:34.374
THIS GENTLEMAN HAD.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.208
>> Stewart: WHAT!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.376
>> AND THEY HAD... LIKE I SAID,

09:36.376 --> 09:37.177
ALL THESE BAGS, ALL THESE TOTES

09:37.177 --> 09:38.077
WERE FILLED.

09:38.077 --> 09:38.845
THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE A

09:38.845 --> 09:40.914
ONE-POUND PACKAGE AND THERE'S 75

09:40.914 --> 09:42.649
OF THESE PACKAGES.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.217
AND THIS WAS OUT OF ONE TRAFFIC

09:44.217 --> 09:45.585
STOP.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.286
>> Stewart: WOW!

09:46.286 --> 09:47.554
WHAT DID HE GET PULLED OVER FOR?

09:47.554 --> 09:48.254
>> SPEEDING.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.289
>> Stewart: THE SHERIFF SAYS

09:49.289 --> 09:50.590
THAT BATCH OF POT CAME FROM A

09:50.590 --> 09:52.091
MARIJUANA GROWING FACILITY IN

09:52.091 --> 09:53.726
COLORADO.

09:53.726 --> 09:54.828
HE'S ALSO RECOVERED LOTS OF

09:54.828 --> 09:56.429
EDIBLE PRODUCTS IN CARS HE PULLS

09:56.429 --> 09:58.565
OVER ON I-76.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.166
THE NUMBER OF MARIJUANA CASES IS

10:00.166 --> 10:01.334
SOARING.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.670
IN 2011, WHEN COLORADO ONLY SOLD

10:03.670 --> 10:05.371
MEDICAL CANNABIS, THE SHERIFF

10:05.371 --> 10:06.639
STOPPED SOMEONE COMING BACK FROM

10:06.639 --> 10:08.508
COLORADO WITH POT LESS THAN ONCE

10:08.508 --> 10:09.442
A WEEK.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.044
LAST YEAR, WHEN RECREATIONAL

10:11.044 --> 10:12.712
CANNABIS BECAME LEGAL, THE

10:12.712 --> 10:13.847
SHERIFF'S COUNTY HAD MORE THAN

10:13.847 --> 10:15.715
ONE MARIJUANA CASE A WEEK.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.650
LAST MONTH, THERE WERE AT LEAST

10:17.650 --> 10:19.619
FIVE CASES A WEEK.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.620
>> WE JUST GO OUT AND STOP CARS

10:20.620 --> 10:22.989
FOR NORMAL TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

10:22.989 --> 10:25.058
AND IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE

10:25.058 --> 10:26.159
ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE

10:26.159 --> 10:27.927
GOING OVER TO GET THIS, YOU JUST

10:27.927 --> 10:29.729
CAN'T HELP BUT RUN INTO IT JUST

10:29.729 --> 10:31.731
BY STOPPING A FEW CARS.

10:31.731 --> 10:32.532
>> Stewart: WHAT HASN'T CHANGED

10:32.532 --> 10:33.867
IS THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS

10:33.867 --> 10:35.668
WORKING IN DEUEL COUNTY-- THREE

10:35.668 --> 10:37.337
FULL-TIME AND TWO PART-TIME

10:37.337 --> 10:38.605
OFFICERS.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.139
THE SHERIFF SAYS HIS COUNTY IS

10:40.139 --> 10:41.741
BEING STRETCHED THIN.

10:41.741 --> 10:42.609
>> WELL, WE'RE A SMALL

10:42.609 --> 10:43.643
DEPARTMENT.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.577
WE USUALLY HAVE ONE PERSON ON AT

10:44.577 --> 10:47.413
A TIME, SO, IF THEY RUN ACROSS

10:47.413 --> 10:48.848
SOMETHING, THEN THEY'RE HAVING

10:48.848 --> 10:50.016
TO CALL SOMEBODY OUT.

10:50.016 --> 10:50.717
WELL, THEN YOU'RE PAYING

10:50.717 --> 10:51.518
OVERTIME.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.819
AND WHERE WE'VE HAD MORE ARRESTS

10:52.819 --> 10:53.586
AND MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL, YOU

10:53.586 --> 10:55.622
KNOW, IT TAKES UP MORE TIME IN

10:55.622 --> 10:56.389
THE COURT.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.156
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING TO

10:57.156 --> 10:58.024
TRANSPORT PRISONERS BACK AND

10:58.024 --> 10:59.325
FORTH, HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE

10:59.325 --> 11:01.027
COURTROOM FOR SECURITY.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.730
SO, IT TIES UP OUR TIME DEALING

11:03.730 --> 11:06.366
WITH THESE VERSUS... YOU KNOW,

11:06.366 --> 11:07.233
WE COULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS,

11:07.233 --> 11:08.568
PATROLLING IN TOWN.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.435
>> CAN I SEE A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

11:09.435 --> 11:10.703
REGISTRATION, INSURANCE, PLEASE?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.071
>> Stewart: IT TAKES UP TIME AND

11:12.071 --> 11:12.805
MONEY.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.507
AFTER AN ARREST, REGARDLESS OF

11:14.507 --> 11:15.608
WHETHER THE PERSON IS FROM

11:15.608 --> 11:18.111
NEBRASKA, COLORADO OR ELSEWHERE,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.512
THE COUNTY PICKS UP THE BILL FOR

11:19.512 --> 11:20.914
HOUSING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT

11:20.914 --> 11:22.615
FOR THOSE IN CUSTODY, AS WELL AS

11:22.615 --> 11:23.783
THE COST OF HIRING A PUBLIC

11:23.783 --> 11:25.285
DEFENDER.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.486
SHERIFF HAYWARD SAYS HIS ANNUAL

11:26.486 --> 11:29.122
JAIL BUDGET HAS ALMOST TRIPLED,

11:29.122 --> 11:32.191
UP NEARLY $100,000 SINCE 2011.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.126
>> WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING JUMP

11:33.126 --> 11:35.995
UP $100,000, THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

11:35.995 --> 11:37.397
INCREASE FOR 2,000 PEOPLE TO

11:37.397 --> 11:38.398
COVER.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.132
>> Stewart: HOW ARE YOU CLOSING

11:39.132 --> 11:40.833
THAT GAP, FINANCIALLY?

11:40.833 --> 11:42.535
>> BASICALLY, OUT HERE, I MEAN,

11:42.535 --> 11:43.803
ALL THE TAX REVENUE IS GENERATED

11:43.803 --> 11:45.405
FROM PROPERTY TAXES.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.407
SO, IF THE COUNTY NEEDS MORE

11:47.407 --> 11:48.641
MONEY, THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE

11:48.641 --> 11:51.110
PROPERTY TAXES, AND, YOU KNOW,

11:51.110 --> 11:53.780
IT GOES BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.114
>> Stewart: NEBRASKA LAW ENDS

11:55.114 --> 11:57.350
HERE AT THE COLORADO BORDER.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.585
SO, WHILE SHERIFF HAYWARD IS

11:58.585 --> 12:00.453
DOING HIS JOB JUST OVER THERE IN

12:00.453 --> 12:02.589
THE CORNHUSKER STATE, OVER HERE

12:02.589 --> 12:03.590
THE OWNER OF THE FIRST

12:03.590 --> 12:05.191
DISPENSARY BY COLORADO'S NORTH

12:05.191 --> 12:07.493
BORDER IS DOING HIS.

12:07.493 --> 12:08.695
>> I'M CURRENTLY EMPLOYING NINE

12:08.695 --> 12:09.696
PEOPLE FULL-TIME.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.431
>> Stewart: MIKE KOLLARTIS OWNS

12:11.431 --> 12:12.865
A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY IN

12:12.865 --> 12:14.801
SEDGWICK, COLORADO, A TOWN ABOUT

12:14.801 --> 12:16.769
SEVEN MILES FROM THE BORDER.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.338
HIS STORE, SEDGWICK ALTERNATIVE

12:18.338 --> 12:20.039
RELIEF, WHICH SELLS BOTH MEDICAL

12:20.039 --> 12:21.908
AND RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, IS

12:21.908 --> 12:23.543
NEWLY RENOVATED.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.911
IT STANDS OUT ALONG THIS MAIN

12:24.911 --> 12:26.079
STREET THAT HAS SEEN BETTER

12:26.079 --> 12:27.447
DAYS.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.548
IT HAS BECOME THE MAIN DRAW TO

12:28.548 --> 12:31.851
THIS QUIET TOWN OF 150 PEOPLE.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.720
>> THEY'RE PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT

12:33.720 --> 12:35.488
THE RENOVATIONS I'VE DONE, THE

12:35.488 --> 12:36.789
EMPLOYMENT I'VE BROUGHT.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.825
THE DOLLARS, THE TAX REVENUE

12:38.825 --> 12:40.093
DOLLARS ARE OUTSTANDING.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.527
>> OH, MY GOODNESS!

12:41.527 --> 12:43.062
IT'S BEEN GOOD.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.464
>> Stewart: LUPE PENA CASIAS

12:44.464 --> 12:45.798
OWNS A RESTAURANT AND INN ACROSS

12:45.798 --> 12:46.833
THE STREET.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.900
SHE SAYS THE TOWN HAS SEEN A

12:47.900 --> 12:49.402
HUGE FINANCIAL BOOST BECAUSE

12:49.402 --> 12:50.603
EACH TIME THERE'S A MARIJUANA

12:50.603 --> 12:52.238
SALE AT THE STORE, THE TOWN OF

12:52.238 --> 12:54.007
SEDGWICK GETS A $5 TRANSACTION

12:54.007 --> 12:54.874
FEE.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.142
AND AS LONG AS THE DISPENSARY IS

12:56.142 --> 12:58.511
OPEN, THE CUSTOMERS KEEP COMING.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.879
>> IT'S BUSY, BUSY, BUSY OVER

12:59.879 --> 13:02.849
THERE AND BUSY, BUSY, BUSY HERE.

13:02.849 --> 13:03.683
>> Stewart: EMPLOYEES AT THE

13:03.683 --> 13:05.018
STORE ARE TRAINED TO LOOK OUT

13:05.018 --> 13:06.219
FOR CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT BREAK

13:06.219 --> 13:07.253
THE LAW.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.488
THE DISPENSARY ALSO DISPLAYS

13:08.488 --> 13:09.956
SIGNS DETAILING THE MARIJUANA

13:09.956 --> 13:11.658
LAWS OF COLORADO AND NEIGHBORING

13:11.658 --> 13:12.692
STATES.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.627
YET THERE IS STILL AN INFLUX OF

13:14.627 --> 13:16.229
POT COMING INTO NEBRASKA AND

13:16.229 --> 13:18.297
OKLAHOMA, SO THE ATTORNEYS

13:18.297 --> 13:20.166
GENERAL OF BOTH STATES FILED A

13:20.166 --> 13:21.668
LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. SUPREME

13:21.668 --> 13:23.736
COURT IN DECEMBER, ALLEGING THAT

13:23.736 --> 13:25.738
THEY "HAVE SUFFERED DIRECT AND

13:25.738 --> 13:27.774
SIGNIFICANT HARM ARISING FROM

13:27.774 --> 13:29.075
THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF

13:29.075 --> 13:31.277
COLORADO-SOURCED MARIJUANA."

13:31.277 --> 13:32.945
NEBRASKA AND OKLAHOMA ALSO

13:32.945 --> 13:34.313
CONTEND THAT COLORADO'S

13:34.313 --> 13:36.282
MARIJUANA LAW "DIRECTLY

13:36.282 --> 13:37.950
CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL LAW AND

13:37.950 --> 13:39.585
UNDERMINES THE AREA OF DRUG

13:39.585 --> 13:41.387
CONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT."

13:41.387 --> 13:42.655
AND SO, BOTH STATES ARE ASKING

13:42.655 --> 13:44.323
THE SUPREME COURT TO DECLARE

13:44.323 --> 13:46.059
COLORADO'S MARIJUANA LAW

13:46.059 --> 13:48.094
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND, IN DOING

13:48.094 --> 13:50.229
SO, UNDO COLORADO'S MARIJUANA

13:50.229 --> 13:52.331
REGULATORY SYSTEM.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.533
BILL KELLY IS A REPORTER WITH

13:53.533 --> 13:54.867
NEBRASKA'S PUBLIC RADIO STATION,

13:54.867 --> 13:56.502
NET, WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE

13:56.502 --> 13:57.503
ISSUE.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.504
WE VIDEO-CHATTED WITH HIM

13:58.504 --> 13:59.539
BECAUSE HE'S BASED IN THE

13:59.539 --> 14:01.240
STATE'S CAPITOL, LINCOLN, OVER

14:01.240 --> 14:02.775
300 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE WE

14:02.775 --> 14:04.010
WERE REPORTING AT THE

14:04.010 --> 14:06.179
NEBRASKA/COLORADO BORDER.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.680
MEDICAL MARIJUANA, OBVIOUSLY,

14:07.680 --> 14:08.881
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME

14:08.881 --> 14:10.817
IN COLORADO, AND EVERYONE SAW

14:10.817 --> 14:12.018
THAT RECREATIONAL WAS COMING

14:12.018 --> 14:13.553
DOWN THE PIPELINE.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.155
WHY DIDN'T NEBRASKA LEGISLATORS

14:16.155 --> 14:18.624
GET MORE INVOLVED IN DEALING

14:18.624 --> 14:20.393
WITH THIS POROUS BORDER ISSUE

14:20.393 --> 14:22.095
EARLIER?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.330
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN NEBRASKA

14:24.330 --> 14:27.600
POLICY MAKERS WERE REALLY

14:27.600 --> 14:29.302
PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO

14:29.302 --> 14:30.169
HAPPEN.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.138
YOU WERE STARTING TO SEE MORE

14:32.138 --> 14:33.306
POSSESSION CASES, YOU WERE

14:33.306 --> 14:35.441
STARTING TO SEE MORE DRIVING

14:35.441 --> 14:37.410
UNDER-THE-INFLUENCE CASES.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.846
BUT THERE WAS, I THINK, A LITTLE

14:39.846 --> 14:40.780
BIT OF A DEER-IN-THE-HEADLIGHTS

14:40.780 --> 14:44.250
FEELING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

14:44.250 --> 14:46.586
THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.520
>> Stewart: SOME NEBRASKAN

14:47.520 --> 14:48.688
LAWMAKERS BELIEVE THAT THE

14:48.688 --> 14:50.156
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS TO

14:50.156 --> 14:51.524
CHANGE THE STATE'S MARIJUANA

14:51.524 --> 14:52.959
LAWS, BUT THERE ARE MANY

14:52.959 --> 14:54.193
DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO

14:54.193 --> 14:55.161
DO.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.662
ONE WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE MEDICAL

14:56.662 --> 14:58.531
CANNABIS WHILE ANOTHER WOULD

14:58.531 --> 14:59.866
INCREASE THE FINES FOR EDIBLE

14:59.866 --> 15:01.834
MARIJUANA PRODUCTS.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.935
THE PENALTIES IN NEBRASKA DEPEND

15:02.935 --> 15:04.203
ON HOW MUCH POT IS IN YOUR

15:04.203 --> 15:05.471
POSSESSION.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.672
A FIRST-TIME OFFENSE, UNDER AN

15:06.672 --> 15:09.041
OUNCE, IS A $300 FINE.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.676
MORE THAN AN OUNCE BUT LESS THAN

15:10.676 --> 15:12.445
A POUND IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH

15:12.445 --> 15:14.881
POSSIBLE JAIL TIME AND A FINE.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.249
BUT MORE THAN A POUND IS A

15:16.249 --> 15:18.351
FELONY WITH A MAXIMUM FIVE YEARS

15:18.351 --> 15:22.522
IN PRISON AND/OR A $10,000 FINE.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.489
WHILE NEBRASKA DELIBERATES

15:23.489 --> 15:25.057
WHETHER TO ALLOW MARIJUANA OR

15:25.057 --> 15:26.626
KEEP IT OUT OF THE STATE, SOME

15:26.626 --> 15:28.494
RESIDENTS LIKE JEREMY CRARY FIND

15:28.494 --> 15:29.629
THEMSELVES CAUGHT BETWEEN THE

15:29.629 --> 15:32.865
LAWS OF NEBRASKA AND COLORADO.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.100
NINE YEARS AGO, CRARY

15:34.100 --> 15:35.635
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HIMSELF IN THE

15:35.635 --> 15:37.804
HEAD WHILE PLAYING WITH A GUN.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.372
AFTER PAINFUL SURGERIES AND

15:39.372 --> 15:41.474
PHYSICAL THERAPY, HE SPENT YEARS

15:41.474 --> 15:42.909
ON MORE THAN A DOZEN MEDICATIONS

15:42.909 --> 15:44.844
AND RECEIVED REGULAR SHOTS OF

15:44.844 --> 15:47.580
BOTOX FOR SEVERE MUSCLE SPASMS.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.282
BUT RECENTLY, HE STARTED TAKING

15:49.282 --> 15:51.017
MEDICAL CANNABIS INSTEAD.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.785
HE SAYS IT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE

15:52.785 --> 15:54.120
IN RELIEVING HIS PAIN AND

15:54.120 --> 15:55.154
SPASMS.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.489
>> SO, I JUST QUIT TAKING ALL MY

15:56.489 --> 15:57.456
PAIN PILLS THEY PRESCRIBED ME

15:57.456 --> 15:58.624
AND STUFF.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.592
>> Reporter: CRARY HAS MADE

15:59.592 --> 16:01.060
SEVERAL TRIPS ACROSS THE BORDER

16:01.060 --> 16:02.862
TO MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.497
HE SAYS THE STRAINS OF CANNIBIS

16:04.497 --> 16:06.098
HE CAN LEGALLY PURCHASE IN

16:06.098 --> 16:07.967
COLORADO ARE BETTER FOR HIS PAIN

16:07.967 --> 16:09.468
THAN WHAT HE CAN ILLEGALLY GET

16:09.468 --> 16:10.469
IN HIS AREA.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.038
WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU TO

16:12.038 --> 16:14.674
KNOWINGLY BREAK THE LAW WHEN

16:14.674 --> 16:15.575
YOU'RE DRIVING BACK FROM

16:15.575 --> 16:17.376
COLORADO WITH SOME WEED IN YOUR

16:17.376 --> 16:19.345
CAR HEADING HOME?

16:19.345 --> 16:20.847
>> I MEAN, IT MAKES YOU FEEL

16:20.847 --> 16:22.281
LIKE A CRIMINAL.

16:22.281 --> 16:22.815
I HATE IT.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.749
I NEVER KNOW WHETHER THE NEXT

16:23.749 --> 16:25.418
COP'S GOING TO BE, SO I'M ALWAYS

16:25.418 --> 16:26.586
LOOKING AROUND.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.286
>> Stewart: WE SPOKE TO A

16:27.286 --> 16:28.421
SHERIFF OF DEUEL COUNTY, WHICH

16:28.421 --> 16:29.322
IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES YOU

HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH TO GET

16:30.690 --> 16:32.692
BACK THIS WAY.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.826
ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT

16:33.826 --> 16:34.927
BEING PART OF THAT GROUP THAT'S

16:34.927 --> 16:36.062
BREAKING THE LAW OR THAT'S

16:36.062 --> 16:37.897
CAUSING HIM AND THE TAXPAYERS IN

16:37.897 --> 16:39.398
THAT TOWN A PROBLEM?

16:39.398 --> 16:40.766
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

16:40.766 --> 16:41.567
I'M NOT LOOKING TO JUST GET

16:41.567 --> 16:42.401
HIGH.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.236
I'M NOT TRYING TO BRING IT BACK

16:43.236 --> 16:43.970
AND SELL IT.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.705
I'M JUST TRYING TO RELIEVE

16:45.705 --> 16:47.440
MYSELF OF HAVING TO USE

16:47.440 --> 16:49.141
PHARMACEUTICALS TO HAVE A DECENT

16:49.141 --> 16:50.209
LIFE.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.348
THIS LEGALLY IN COLORADO AS

OPPOSED TO BREAKING TWO LAWS IN

NEBRASKA-- "I'M GOING TO BUY IT

16:58.284 --> 16:59.318
ILLEGALLY AND THEN I'M GOING TO

USE IT ILLEGALLY"-- SHOULDN'T

17:01.354 --> 17:03.522
THERE BE SOME SORT OF ELASTICITY

17:03.522 --> 17:06.158
TO THE PUNISHMENT?

17:06.158 --> 17:07.093
>> NO.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.629
I MEAN, IT'S LEGAL OVER THERE.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.263
THAT'S FINE.

17:10.263 --> 17:10.930
IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT OVER

17:10.930 --> 17:12.031
THERE, USE IT OVER THERE.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.366
DON'T COME BACK HERE WITH IT

17:13.366 --> 17:14.834
BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.133
SHOW CENTERED AROUND AN ASIAN

20:01.133 --> 20:02.568
AMERICAN FAMILY.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.770
>> IF YOU TRY TO SUSPEND OUR SON

20:04.770 --> 20:06.372
BECAUSE OF THIS, WE WILL SUE

20:06.372 --> 20:08.340
EVERYONE IN THIS SCHOOL.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.575
>> SO FAST IT WILL MAKE YOUR

20:09.575 --> 20:11.811
HEAD SPIN.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.913
HEY, IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY,

20:13.913 --> 20:14.914
RIGHT?

20:14.914 --> 20:15.614
>> Reporter: THE SHOW IS BASED

20:15.614 --> 20:17.550
ON THE MEMOIR OF EDDIE HUANG, A

20:17.550 --> 20:19.952
CELEBRITY CHEF, RESTAURATEUR AND

20:19.952 --> 20:21.554
HOST OF THE WEB SERIES "HUANG'S

20:21.554 --> 20:23.923
WORLD" ON vice.com.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.391
THE SITCOM FOCUSES ON EDDIE'S

20:25.391 --> 20:27.259
ROUGH CHILDHOOD AND HIS PARENTS'

20:27.259 --> 20:28.928
STRUGGLES AS IMMIGRANTS TRYING

20:28.928 --> 20:30.963
TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM BY

20:30.963 --> 20:32.498
STARTING A WESTERN-THEMED

20:32.498 --> 20:33.532
RESTAURANT.

20:33.532 --> 20:34.967
EVEN SEEING ONE ASIAN AMERICAN

20:34.967 --> 20:36.602
ON TV USED TO BE A RARE

20:36.602 --> 20:38.771
OCCURRENCE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF

20:38.771 --> 20:40.473
ACTORS LIKE GEORGE TAKEI IN

20:40.473 --> 20:42.174
"STAR TREK" AND BRUCE LEE IN

20:42.174 --> 20:43.476
"THE GREEN HORNET."

20:43.476 --> 20:44.977
BUT SUCCESS IN THE SITCOM WORLD

20:44.977 --> 20:46.445
HAS BEEN SLOW.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.380
>> DO YOU KNOW WHY I ENCOURAGE

20:48.380 --> 20:49.748
YOUR BROTHER TO BECOME A

20:49.748 --> 20:50.716
CARDIOLOGIST?

20:50.716 --> 20:51.550
>> NO.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.384
>> BECAUSE I ALWAYS KNEW THAT

20:52.384 --> 20:53.486
ONE DAY YOU GIVE ME A HEART

20:53.486 --> 20:54.086
ATTACK.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.955
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.890
>> Reporter: IN 1994, "ALL

21:02.962 --> 21:04.396
CENTERED AROUND AN ASIAN

21:04.396 --> 21:06.398
AMERICAN FAMILY, BUT IT WAS

21:06.398 --> 21:08.300
CANCELED AFTER 21 EPISODES DUE

21:08.300 --> 21:09.668
TO POOR REVIEWS AND SINKING

21:09.668 --> 21:10.803
RATINGS.

21:10.803 --> 21:11.971
>> YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT

21:11.971 --> 21:13.172
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

21:13.172 --> 21:14.373
GO INTO THE SUCCESS OF A

21:14.373 --> 21:16.142
TELEVISION SHOW, MANY REASONS

21:16.142 --> 21:17.409
WHY YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THAT A

21:17.409 --> 21:19.278
SHOW MIGHT NOT WORK.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.682
BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING AS

21:23.682 --> 21:25.317
SINGULAR AS AN ASIAN-AMERICAN

21:25.317 --> 21:28.787
SITCOM ON TELEVISION, WHEN IT

21:28.787 --> 21:30.055
DOESN'T WORK, IT'S VERY EASY TO

21:30.055 --> 21:31.991
BLAME THE FACT THAT AMERICANS

21:31.991 --> 21:33.792
DON'T WANT TO SEE AN ASIAN.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.560
>> Reporter: "FRESH OFF THE

21:47.940 --> 21:49.508
VIEWERS BUT STILL BEAT

21:49.508 --> 21:51.544
COMPETITION LIKE NBC'S LONG-

RUNNING SITCOM "PARKS AND

21:52.945 --> 21:54.013
RECREATION."

21:54.013 --> 21:55.181

21:55.181 --> 21:56.248
LIKE, WOW, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE

21:56.248 --> 21:57.216
MOMENT OF PROGRESS.

21:57.216 --> 21:57.983
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT

21:57.983 --> 21:59.518
UNDERSCORES WAYS IN WHICH OUR

21:59.518 --> 22:02.221
MASS POPULAR CULTURE IS STILL A

22:02.221 --> 22:03.589
LAGGING INDICATOR, NOT A LEADING

22:03.589 --> 22:04.757
INDICATOR.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.492
IT... IT FOLLOWS A LITTLE BIT

22:06.492 --> 22:08.761
BEHIND WHAT'S ACTUALLY CHANGING

22:08.761 --> 22:10.529
ON THE GROUND, IN OUR LIVES, IN

OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR FAMILIES.

MOST OF YOUR COMMENTS WERE,

22:34.053 --> 22:35.588
WELL, SKEPTICAL.

JEANSC SAID: "THE KEY TO

22:46.065 --> 22:47.466
THE MANUFACTURERS LOCATING HERE

22:47.466 --> 22:48.901
ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, MAINLY

22:48.901 --> 22:50.469
TRYING TO BUY THE LABOR AS

22:50.469 --> 22:52.238
CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE AND MAKE

22:52.238 --> 22:54.006
SURE IT'S MORE EXPLOITABLE BY

22:54.006 --> 22:56.008
BEING NON-UNION."

CURTIS ADDED: "A $15 PER HOUR

23:05.784 --> 23:07.319
COLLEGE OR SAVE FOR A DECENT

ECONOMY IN HIS AREA.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.440
I WOULD ASSUME IT DEPENDS WHAT

23:39.652 --> 23:41.787
AND SO, HOPEFULLY, THEY ARE

23:41.787 --> 23:43.255
THOSE TYPE THAT WILL BE

23:43.255 --> 23:45.457
TRANSFERRED FROM ONE GENERATION

23:50.629 --> 23:52.331
THEN, LIKE THE NORTHERN STATES,

23:52.331 --> 23:54.066
ANOTHER STATE OR COUNTRY WILL

23:54.066 --> 23:56.135
UNDERCUT THE COST-- TAX BREAKS,

23:56.135 --> 23:58.203
ETC.-- AND THEY WILL MOVE.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.638
MANUFACTURING JOBS WORK ONLY

WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE WILLING TO
