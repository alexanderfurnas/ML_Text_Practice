JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.107 --> 00:10.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
behind the hack.

00:10.110 --> 00:15.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A U.S. intelligence report finds
Russia's
President Putin ordered the
campaign to influence

00:15.749 --> 00:20.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our election, with a clear
preference for
Donald Trump.

00:20.387 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: the latest on
today's deadly shooting
at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.

00:24.758 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, I sit down with Secretary
of State John
Kerry to talk about U.S.-Russia
relations

00:31.365 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the aftermath of the election
hack and
diplomatic challenges ahead for
the Trump

00:36.236 --> 00:37.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It's
going to take a lot of work.

00:39.940 --> 00:45.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not going to be easy, and
it has to be
done in a way that is
verifiable, real, without

00:45.946 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving up American principles
and values in
the process.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:51.251 --> 00:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the week's news.

00:55.656 --> 01:02.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:02.663 --> 01:05.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.565 --> 01:16.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI, the CIA
and National
Security Agency are out tonight
with a final

01:16.710 --> 01:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report on Russian meddling in
the 2016 presidential
election.

01:21.281 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they're confident that
Russia's President
Vladimir Putin personally
ordered it, with

01:26.954 --> 01:30.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- quote -- "clear preference"
for president-elect
Trump.

01:30.724 --> 01:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before he was briefed on the
findings today,
Mr. Trump said it was all --
quote -- "a political

01:35.762 --> 01:37.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
witch-hunt."

01:37.698 --> 01:41.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, he said it was a
constructive session,
but noted the agencies found
again -- quote

01:41.868 --> 01:45.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "absolutely no effect on the
outcome of
the election."

01:45.839 --> 01:50.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, the report says
officials didn't
assess the effect of the Russian
efforts.

01:50.510 --> 01:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will look at all this after
the news summary.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day's other major story is
in Florida.

01:56.850 --> 02:03.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Panic erupted at the Fort
Lauderdale Airport,
when a gunman shot five people
to death and

02:03.056 --> 02:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wounded eight more before he was
captured.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham picks it up
from there.

02:08.428 --> 02:14.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The shooting
set off an
afternoon of chaotic reports
about exactly

02:14.334 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what was going on.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Mort of Feature Story News
is at the
Fort Lauderdale Airport.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he joins me via telephone.

02:21.341 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Steve, I understand you were
there soon
after this attack came to an
end.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us what you first
saw?

02:28.248 --> 02:31.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE MORT, Feature Story News:
Yes, we were
here very soon after it took
place, maybe

02:31.885 --> 02:34.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 20 minutes to half-an-hour
or so.

02:34.821 --> 02:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we got to the airport, we
tried to
find a vantage point to
establish our camera.

02:40.227 --> 02:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We managed to find a vantage
point on the
parking garage that was
overlooking terminal

02:45.499 --> 02:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two, where the shooting took
place, of course,
in the baggage claim area.

02:50.670 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened was, there
were subsequent
reports of a shooter inside that
parking garage,

02:56.610 --> 02:59.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that prompted the SWAT team
to move in.

02:59.212 --> 03:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They moved us, as well as other
passengers,
members of the public that were
in that parking

03:04.217 --> 03:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
garage out and into one of the
other terminals
here at the Fort Lauderdale
Airport.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, it was a very surreal
situation.

03:11.858 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had to duck behind cars as
SWAT team members
spotted an unidentified
individual within

03:17.330 --> 03:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the parking garage, which, of
course, triggered
multiple rumors there were, in
fact, other

03:22.369 --> 03:28.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shooters, a very common
phenomenon in mass
shooting incidents, which many
of us who have

03:28.075 --> 03:30.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had the misfortune to cover them
know well.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eventually, we did manage to
reach the terminal.

03:33.780 --> 03:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw several groups of people
who had been
asked to clear areas by the
police, running,

03:39.019 --> 03:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screaming, many of them not sure
what was
going on.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was a pretty chaotic
scene.

03:43.824 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, we
understand from the
sheriff and from the governor
there is a suspect

03:47.461 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
named Esteban Santiago who has
been apprehended.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now believed to be the
only shooter.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do we know about who this
man is?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEVE MORT: Yes, that is
correct.

03:56.136 --> 04:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do understand at this stage
that he did
act on his own.

04:00.474 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We understand that he boarded a
plane in Alaska.

04:05.245 --> 04:11.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We understand that Esteban
Santiago then flew
to Fort Lauderdale, where he
unpacked from

04:11.985 --> 04:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his packed -- or from his
checked baggage
a firearm.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We understand that he flew with
it, he checked
it into his checked luggage.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, you're allowed to do
that.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't take firearms on the
plane.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can put them in your checked
bags.

04:25.098 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took a gun out of his checked
bag, went
to a bathroom in the baggage
claim area or

04:31.872 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adjacent to the baggage claim
area in the
terminal two here at the
airport, when he

04:38.044 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loaded the weapon, then went
back out into
the baggage claim area and
opened fire.

04:43.984 --> 04:52.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the suspect himself,
Esteban Santiago,
we're getting sort of patchy
details about

04:52.058 --> 04:53.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his background.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is suspected to be a former
U.S. Army soldier
from the New York area.

04:58.431 --> 05:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we do know that Esteban's
brother says
that he had been receiving
psychological treatment

05:03.703 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while living in Alaska and that
Esteban's
girlfriend had alerted the
brother to the

05:08.675 --> 05:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation after the shooting had
unfolded.

05:10.977 --> 05:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, of course, the main point
now for authorities
will be to try to figure out
exactly what

05:16.316 --> 05:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the motivation here was in this
attack.

05:18.985 --> 05:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't believe at the moment,
according
to authorities, that there was a
terrorism

05:24.324 --> 05:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
motivation here, but certainly
FBI officials
are going to be questioning him
intensely

05:29.429 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the coming hours and days,
trying to
find out exactly why he carried
out this attack.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Steve Mort of
Feature Story News, thank you
very much.

05:37.470 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
election of Donald Trump as
president was

05:41.942 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certified when Congress tallied
the Electoral
College votes.

05:46.046 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Vice President Joe Biden
presided, as a number
of House Democrats objected, but
none had

05:51.851 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the support of a senator, as the
rules require.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Even as people waited
hours in Georgia...

05:56.456 --> 05:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: There is no debate.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no debate.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's not signed by a senator,
the objection
cannot be entertained.

06:03.163 --> 06:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Mr. President, the
objection is signed
by a member of the House, but
not yet by a

06:08.335 --> 06:09.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
member of the Senate.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, it is over.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:11.338 --> 06:13.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:13.073 --> 06:21.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump
finished with 304
electoral votes to 227 for
Hillary Clinton.

06:21.848 --> 06:26.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She won the popular vote by a
margin of about
2.9 million.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect was busy on
other fronts
today.

06:29.289 --> 06:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a series of tweets, he
disputed reports
that U.S. taxpayers will pay for
a wall on

06:35.262 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Mexican border under a plan
his own advisers
shared with Congress.

06:39.699 --> 06:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he insisted that Mexico
will reimburse
the cost later.

06:44.137 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he mocked Arnold
Schwarzenegger's low
ratings as his replacement on
the new "Celebrity

06:50.176 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Apprentice" television show.

06:51.945 --> 06:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump wrote -- quote -- "So
much for being
a movie star."

06:56.383 --> 07:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Job creation in the U.S. slowed
last month,
as the unemployment rate ticked
higher.

07:01.488 --> 07:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Labor Department
reports the economy
saw a net gain of 156,000 jobs.

07:08.028 --> 07:14.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The jobless rate edged up to 4.7
percent,
as more people started looking
for work.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hourly pay rose nearly 3
percent.

07:16.703 --> 07:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the most in more than
seven years,
as employers paid more to
attract and to keep

07:22.842 --> 07:24.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From President Obama today, a
challenge on
repealing Obamacare.

07:27.914 --> 07:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that Republicans need to
present their
alternative before they repeal
the existing

07:33.353 --> 07:35.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with the news
Web site Vox,
he acknowledged the Affordable
Care Act has

07:38.725 --> 07:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flaws, but he challenged critics
to come up
with an improvement.

07:41.795 --> 07:46.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I am saying to every Republican
right now,

07:46.066 --> 07:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you, in fact, can put a plan
together that
is demonstrably better than what
Obamacare

07:53.973 --> 08:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing, I will publicly
support repealing
Obamacare and replacing it with
your plan.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I want to see it first.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans have
yet to agree
on their own plan, but they say
they hope

08:08.822 --> 08:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to enact repeal and to vote on a
replacement
this year.

08:13.893 --> 08:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia announced today that it's
withdrawing
some of its forces from Syria,
starting with

08:18.264 --> 08:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an aircraft carrier and other
warships.

08:20.934 --> 08:27.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The carrier the Admiral
Kuznetsov was deployed
in November, as Russia
intensified airstrikes

08:27.073 --> 08:28.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Eastern Aleppo.

08:28.541 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the city that fell to
Syrian government
forces on December 22.

08:33.313 --> 08:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The long-running search for
Malaysia Airlines
Flight MH370 will finally end in
two weeks.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malaysia's government says it's
calling a
halt, as teams finish searching
more than

08:45.492 --> 08:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
46,000 square miles in the
Indian Ocean.

08:48.828 --> 08:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The airliner disappeared in
March of 2014,
with 239 people on board.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Debris has washed up in Eastern
Africa.

08:58.538 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, states
across the Deep
South declared emergencies today
ahead of

09:03.209 --> 09:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a winter storm, and Atlanta
braced for the
worst.

09:06.646 --> 09:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 2014 storm paralyzed the city
and stranded
thousands of people overnight on
jammed highways.

09:15.088 --> 09:18.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials said plans are in
place to avoid
a repeat.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street closed the week on a
high note.

09:21.361 --> 09:28.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 64
points to finish at 19963, after
flirting

09:28.968 --> 09:30.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with 20000.

09:30.336 --> 09:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 33 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly eight.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P
closings were
new records.

09:39.746 --> 09:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Michelle Obama had her final
formal event
as first lady today.

09:44.551 --> 09:49.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spoke at a White House event
for the school
counselor of the year, and she
spoke directly

09:49.589 --> 09:51.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the nation's youth.

09:51.357 --> 09:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: Lead
by example
with hope, never fear, and know
that I will

09:57.931 --> 10:03.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be with you, rooting for you and
working to
support you for the rest of my
life.

10:03.336 --> 10:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being your first lady has been
the greatest
honor of my life, and I hope I
have made you

10:09.843 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
proud.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obamas have
two more weeks
in the White House, until
Inauguration Day,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 20.

10:16.115 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a first look
at the intelligence report on
Russian hacking;

10:21.187 --> 10:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry's
view of Russia
and the state relations with the
rest of the

10:25.925 --> 10:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world; Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze
the week's news; plus, much
more.

10:35.969 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world; Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze
the week's news; plus, much
more.

10:43.376 --> 10:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the report issued
this afternoon
by the U.S. intelligence
community on what

10:48.281 --> 10:53.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it calls Russian activities and
intentions
in recent U.S. elections.

10:53.419 --> 10:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report is a public version
of a highly
classified assessment given to
the president

10:58.491 --> 11:00.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other top officials.

11:00.326 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It alleges that Russia used
covert operations
to steal material from the
Democratic Party

11:05.698 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and others, and disseminated it
through media
organizations that it controls
and through

11:11.037 --> 11:12.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
third-party groups.

11:12.906 --> 11:18.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It called the campaign a
significant escalation
of Russian efforts to -- quote
-- "undermine

11:18.344 --> 11:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S.-led liberal democratic
order."

11:21.681 --> 11:26.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For more on the report's
findings and its
effects, I'm joined from Capitol
Hill by California

11:26.486 --> 11:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Representative Adam Schiff.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the top Democrat on the
House Intelligence
Committee.

11:31.558 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for the record, we called
every current
Republican member serving on the
Senate and

11:36.429 --> 11:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House Intelligence Committees.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
None was available.

11:39.766 --> 11:43.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adam Schiff, Congressman Schiff,
thank you
very much for joining us.

11:43.703 --> 11:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this report says it has
high confidence
that President Vladimir Putin
personally ordered

11:50.410 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this campaign to interfere with
the U.S. election.

11:53.746 --> 12:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't say how it knows
that, but after
you were briefed and have read
the classified

12:00.086 --> 12:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report, are you confident that
that's what
happened?

12:02.121 --> 12:03.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
Well, I am very
confident in it.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think all the members of
the Intelligence
Committee, Democrats and
Republicans, are

12:08.595 --> 12:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confident in the conclusions
about the Russian
involvement.

12:12.165 --> 12:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been on the committee now
for almost
10 years, and this is among the
best documented,

12:16.736 --> 12:22.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
most ironclad, I think,
intelligence reports
that I have seen on any major
issue.

12:22.141 --> 12:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this doesn't persuade Donald
Trump about
the facts, nothing will.

12:26.746 --> 12:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The report, also,
Congressman
Schiff, says the Russians
developed what they

12:31.551 --> 12:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
call a clear preference for
Donald Trump.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
How so?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.057 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, there are
many reasons
why the Russians prefer Donald
Trump.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, in the first instance,
they wanted
to tear down Secretary Clinton.

12:44.030 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They, I think, despised her
remarks about
the flawed 2011 elections in
Russia.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They feared that she would be
very tough on
Russia in terms of sanctions.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, on the other hand,
they had
every reason to want.

12:57.076 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was somebody who belittled
NATO, who praised
Putin, who I think would be much
more amenable

13:02.315 --> 13:05.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to their policy in Syria, where
they bomb
civilians.

13:05.485 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there were a lot of reasons
for them to
prefer Donald Trump.

13:09.088 --> 13:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was their aspiration, as the
report makes
clear, to help him and to hurt
her.

13:14.260 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The report also
points out
that the Russian -- how the
Russian military

13:19.098 --> 13:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence passed along this
information
to WikiLeaks, the so-called
transparency organization.

13:26.472 --> 13:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know Julian Assange, the
founder of WikiLeaks,
say they didn't get it from the
Russians.

13:31.310 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What evidence is there in the
report that
there was collaboration between
the Russians

13:37.650 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and WikiLeaks?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: You know, I can't
go into that
evidence, because that's really
the heart

13:42.188 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and soul of the classified
report.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I can say I think the case
is very powerful.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WikiLeaks was a useful medium
for the Russians.

13:51.431 --> 13:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had a little more distance
or deniability
with WikiLeaks than they did
with their other

13:56.369 --> 13:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cutouts, so they made ample use
of it.

13:58.504 --> 14:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Julian Assange knows
this, or he is
affirmatively trying to stick
his head in

14:04.343 --> 14:05.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the sand.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, nonetheless, it was a very
useful platform
for the Russians.

14:07.580 --> 14:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before this
report became public
and, in fact, before
president-elect Trump

14:12.885 --> 14:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was briefed, he said that this
whole thing
is a political witch-hunt, the
findings by

14:21.160 --> 14:23.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. intelligence community.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your reaction to that?

14:24.797 --> 14:25.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: My reaction is
this.

14:27.734 --> 14:32.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need Democrats and
Republicans in Congress
to work together to fashion a
very comprehensive

14:32.605 --> 14:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushback to Russia, not just the
cyber-hacking,
but their bribery of officials
in Europe,

14:37.744 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their social media campaign,
their overt media
campaign.

14:42.315 --> 14:48.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All of the dirty tricks,
basically, the Russians
employ to tear down liberal
democracy, we

14:48.121 --> 14:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to work together on a
bipartisan basis,
and we need the new president's
help.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't do it alone.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has to begin by his
acknowledgment
of the facts.

14:57.964 --> 15:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need him to lead the liberal
democratic
order around the world.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No other nation can do that the
way we can,
and it's going to be very hard
for Congress

15:06.939 --> 15:08.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do it over his opposition.

15:08.741 --> 15:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one of the
other -- one
of the comments he made after
the briefing

15:13.279 --> 15:19.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was he pointed out and
emphasized, he said
he appreciated the briefing, but
he emphasized

15:20.019 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the alleged Russian action
had, in his
words, absolutely no effect on
the outcome

15:26.025 --> 15:27.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the election.

15:27.860 --> 15:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, my reading of what was made
public from
this report is that they didn't
examine whether

15:33.299 --> 15:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hacking affected the outcome
of the election.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: That's exactly
right.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that was very
misleading of the
president-elect to suggest that
this report

15:41.674 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the presentation said there
was no outcome
effect, no effect on the
election itself.

15:46.212 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true there is no evidence
that the tampering
with voter machines or tampering
with voter

15:53.186 --> 15:56.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registrations or any of like
that affected
the counting of the votes.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's true.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not the same thing as
saying there
was no impact on the outcome.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, the daily dumping of
information
that was damaging to Secretary
Clinton and

16:05.731 --> 16:09.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helpful to Donald Trump was
hugely consequential.

16:09.035 --> 16:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not the intelligence
community's
place to say whether this was
determinative

16:13.072 --> 16:14.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, indeed, that's unknowable.

16:15.942 --> 16:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that claim was completely
unsupported
by the report or the briefing he
got today.

16:20.213 --> 16:24.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know,
Congressman Schiff,
that President Obama did take
some moves,

16:24.684 --> 16:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took measures against the
Russian intelligence
community just in the last few
days.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yesterday, I interviewed Vice
President Biden.

16:35.261 --> 16:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said other steps have been
taken that are
not publicly known.

16:39.031 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it your sense that the U.S.
is responding
appropriately?

16:43.269 --> 16:45.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Should more be done?

16:45.171 --> 16:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What should Americans -- what
should America
-- what should the United States
be prepared

16:49.909 --> 16:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do as a result of this?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I think what has
been done so
far by the current
administration is a first

16:56.382 --> 16:57.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
step.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is by no means, I think,
sufficient.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to work in Congress on a
bipartisan
basis.

17:02.021 --> 17:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have reached out on the
Democratic side
to Senator McCain and Graham on
a package

17:07.627 --> 17:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sanctions, broader sanctions,
to make the
Russians pay a price.

17:11.898 --> 17:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even beyond that, we need a
comprehensive
approach to what is a very
successful, well-funded

17:19.639 --> 17:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian effort, through a
variety of vectors,
through, as I mentioned, bribery
of people,

17:25.678 --> 17:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their media platforms, their
hacking,
the publishing of fake news, the
publishing

17:30.883 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of bogus documents, we need to
push back against
all of that.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a threat to the German
elections coming
up.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a threat to our French
allies, our NATO
allies.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need a comprehensive and
hard pushback.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the only thing the Russians
understand.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the only thing that will
deter them.

17:49.535 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Adam
Schiff, the
ranking Democrat on the House
Intelligence

17:53.606 --> 17:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee, we thank you very
much for talking
with us.

17:55.441 --> 17:56.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

17:58.311 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can read
the full declassified
intelligence report on our Web
site.

18:04.450 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now to my interview with
Secretary of
State John Kerry.

18:18.731 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with him earlier
today at the State
Department, before the public
release of that

18:23.502 --> 18:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intelligence report on Russia.

18:25.438 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I began by asking, now that
we have confirmation
Russia interfered in the
election, does that

18:30.843 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fundamentally change
Washington's relationship
with Moscow?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry,
thank you very
much for talking with us.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: My pleasure.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

18:41.487 --> 18:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now that it
has been confirmed
that the Russians interfered
aggressively

18:45.358 --> 18:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. election, does this
represent
a fundamental change in the
United States'

18:50.596 --> 18:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relationship with Russia?

18:51.864 --> 18:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, that remains
to be determined.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly represents a major
challenge
in that relationship.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a hostile act.

18:59.705 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has serious consequences, and
we're going
to have to work that through.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I say we.

19:06.012 --> 19:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean the United States, the
next administration
is going to have to approach
Russia very clearly

19:10.016 --> 19:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
understanding what has happened.

19:11.450 --> 19:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think more
needs to
be done to retaliate as of now?

19:15.888 --> 19:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, I think that
President Obama
made it clear that we would
retaliate at a

19:22.194 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time of our choosing and ways of
our choosing.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means some of them, the
public will
know about, some of them, they
will not know

19:28.968 --> 19:30.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

19:30.803 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, with two weeks left,
I think that
the administration coming in is
going to have

19:35.508 --> 19:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make some judgments of its
own about what
the next steps will be.

19:38.744 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's reported
the Russians
were celebrating the election of
Donald Trump.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why would they be celebrating?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: I'm not going to
speculate.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really think it's too
important.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just am not going to
speculate.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there has been a lot of
news articles.

19:55.227 --> 19:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You all have been covering this
for some period
of time.

19:58.697 --> 20:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are going to draw their
own judgments,
but I'm not going to add to that
speculation.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
Vladimir
Putin wants?

20:05.304 --> 20:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been dealing with him
for a long
time.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think he's after?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, he's after a
lot of things.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are a lot of motivations.

20:14.113 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He obviously has agreed with us
on some things
and disagreed with us on others.

20:20.019 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we managed to find common
ground and work
together effectively on the Iran
nuclear agreement,

20:26.759 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Russia assumed major
responsibilities
to try to get the agreement done
and to make

20:31.864 --> 20:33.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it work.

20:33.666 --> 20:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I can give you a long list of
things where
Russia and President Putin have
found common

20:38.771 --> 20:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground and worked with the
United States.

20:40.739 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, on Ukraine, on the
implementation of
the Minsk agreement, on Syria,
we have obviously

20:47.947 --> 20:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not been able to find the same
kind of common
ground, despite good efforts.

20:52.218 --> 20:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those are problems that are
going to continue
into the next administration.

20:56.989 --> 21:05.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My hope is the next
administration will approach
Russia strategically, with a
clear purpose

21:05.064 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of trying to find more common
ground, but
without giving up on fundamental
values and

21:11.070 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
principles that are at the core
of the United
States' foreign policy.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, are you
concerned that
that could happen?

21:17.309 --> 21:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have talked with your
successor, the designate,
Rex Tillerson.

21:22.448 --> 21:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does he have the same view of
Russian intentions
that you do?

21:28.687 --> 21:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, he and I are
going to sit
down, actually, I think next
week, and have

21:33.259 --> 21:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an opportunity to really debrief
and to go
into these subjects.

21:37.196 --> 21:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I can't comment on what his
approach is
going to be or what he's
thinking at this

21:44.136 --> 21:46.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moment about that.

21:46.038 --> 21:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you that I think
there is an opportunity
here, still, for president-elect
Trump and

21:54.980 --> 22:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then President Trump to try to
reach out to
Russia and see whether or not
they can put

22:00.186 --> 22:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to test the proposition that we
could find
things in which we can agree and
perhaps on

22:06.525 --> 22:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some things on which we're going
to agree
to disagree, but, nevertheless,
put the world

22:10.629 --> 22:12.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a better place.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, at this
moment, you're
not worried that the incoming
administration

22:14.967 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could be naive?

22:16.435 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: Well, I have
questions, like everybody
has questions, Judy.

22:20.206 --> 22:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not -- as secretary of
state, it's
inappropriate for me to start
speculating

22:26.779 --> 22:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
publicly or get caught up in the
day-to-day
back-and-forth.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't want to do that.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's inappropriate.

22:33.652 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there are clear
strategic possibilities
that, if the new administration
pursues correctly,

22:41.860 --> 22:50.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could open up avenues of
cooperation and reduce
tensions and perhaps put to test
whether or

22:50.336 --> 22:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not there could be, you know, a
more improved
day-to-day relationship between
us.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Syria.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I happened to sit down yesterday
with Vice
President Biden.

23:01.113 --> 23:05.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I asked him whether that
represented a failure
for the United States.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He said no.

23:06.986 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My question to you is, if it's
not a failure,
doesn't it at least, beyond
being a humanitarian

23:12.291 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disaster, represent an enormous
missed opportunity
for the United States to shape
events in that

23:18.731 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of the world?

23:19.999 --> 23:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, we did shape
events to a
certain degree.

23:23.736 --> 23:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is certainly going to be
debated whether
or not they were shaped enough
or whether

23:29.508 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain options that might have
shaped them
differently were taken or not
taken.

23:34.380 --> 23:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I agree with the vice
president that the
fact that we were not able,
which is a disappointment,

23:39.818 --> 23:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly, to push the parties
into a place
where they made a different set
of choices,

23:46.859 --> 23:48.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's disappointing.

23:48.494 --> 23:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think it represents,
you know,
some sort of failure on our
part.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can try and try and push
people.

23:55.234 --> 24:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The old saying, you can lead a
horse to water,
but you can't make it drink.

24:00.472 --> 24:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here, we led people to
water, the water
of peace proposition, the water
of Geneva

24:06.378 --> 24:07.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a process.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We laid out through our
leadership the International
Syria Support Group.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We brought Iran to the table.

24:13.819 --> 24:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We brought Russia to the table.

24:15.688 --> 24:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had assurances that Assad
would do certain
things.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He didn't.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He chose not to.

24:26.832 --> 24:31.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the Russians failed,
actually, to deliver
Assad in a way that they said he
would.

24:31.570 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iranians failed to deliver
the process
that they said they would,
because they continued

24:37.509 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prop him up in ways that went
way beyond
the agreement that had been
reached in the

24:43.615 --> 24:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Geneva agreement to try to come
to a political
resolution.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, look, did the whole process
fail?

24:51.056 --> 24:54.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did the international community
fail to solve
it?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, profoundly.

24:55.928 --> 25:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But was that a specific failure
of the United
States?

25:00.299 --> 25:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
History will debate whether some
choices might
have been made or not made that
might have

25:03.869 --> 25:10.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
altered that, but I don't think
it falls exclusively
on us that this problem hasn't
been solved.

25:10.175 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are U.S.
interests advanced
with the way things stand today
in Syria?

25:15.881 --> 25:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: With the way they
stand today?

25:18.984 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, nobody's interests are
served by what's
happening in Syria today.

25:24.723 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a catastrophe.

25:25.924 --> 25:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the worst human catastrophe
since World
War II.

25:29.528 --> 25:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I said just now, it
represents a failure
of the entire international
community to come

25:36.201 --> 25:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to grips with solving it.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a tragedy for the
people who have
been caught in the middle.

25:41.340 --> 25:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am proud of what our
administration
has done, of what we did day to
day to try

25:47.446 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get a cease-fire in place.

25:49.415 --> 25:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am proud that we are the
largest donor of
humanitarian assistance for
refugees.

25:54.620 --> 25:57.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am proud of what we did with
the ISSG.

25:57.556 --> 26:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I regret that we were not
able to be successful
in getting the parties to
Geneva.

26:03.228 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I deeply believe that we are
on the cusp
of seeing that happen over the
course of the

26:08.834 --> 26:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next months, and that it will be
the framework
that we put in place that is
ultimately going

26:15.507 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be the structure around which
peace in
Syria is built.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Several other
countries I want
to mention very quickly.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Israel.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You got a great deal of
attention with the
speech you gave about Israel's
policy, talking

26:29.054 --> 26:30.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the settlements.

26:30.989 --> 26:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right after that, they announced
-- Israel
announced they're expanding the
settlements.

26:35.427 --> 26:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the attitude about
Israel of the incoming
president-elect, Mr. Netanyahu.

26:40.866 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, my question is, were you as
secretary
of state shouting into the wind?

26:46.472 --> 26:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: No, I don't believe
so.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't believe so at all.

26:51.176 --> 26:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every administration through our
history has
said that the settlements are an
obstacle

26:56.148 --> 26:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to peace and they do not have
legal validity.

26:59.751 --> 27:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't break new ground with
that, except
that we reiterated and
reaffirmed that we

27:06.558 --> 27:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not going to sit by idly and
watch a sort
of extreme element within the
current government

27:16.368 --> 27:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move in a direction that we
believe is dangerous
for Israel, reduces the
possibility of peace,

27:25.811 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prolongs the potential of
conflict, and is
completely contrary to American
values and

27:32.818 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests, which have been
expressed by Republican
and Democrat administrations
alike throughout

27:38.223 --> 27:39.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

27:39.224 --> 27:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question.

27:41.727 --> 27:46.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're seen as the most
shoulder-to-the-wheel
secretary of state we have had
in a long time.

27:46.565 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been to every --
virtually every
global -- or you have been
dealing with virtually

27:51.436 --> 27:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every global trouble spot around
the world.

27:56.041 --> 27:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have given this job long
hours.

27:59.077 --> 28:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have traveled nonstop.

28:02.447 --> 28:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you the most proud of?

28:03.949 --> 28:07.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What is your greatest
disappointment as you
walk away?

28:07.185 --> 28:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, you know, I'm
going to duck
you slightly here, in the sense
that I honestly

28:14.593 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't dwell on the
disappointments.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There are some.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have talked about a few
of the things
that are undone.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I am very proud of the
department.

28:23.969 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we are more engaged in
more places
in the world, simultaneously
dealing with

28:31.009 --> 28:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more crises, and with greater
effect in those
more places in the world, than
at any time

28:37.149 --> 28:38.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in American history.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the world is safer
without Iran with
a nuclear weapon.

28:42.521 --> 28:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world has got the potential
to be safer
if we fully implement the Paris
agreement.

28:48.226 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think, all in all,
the Obama administration
and what President Obama has
focused on has

28:55.334 --> 29:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lived up to our need to protect
American interests,
to live our values and assert
our values,

29:04.476 --> 29:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to stand up for future
generations.

29:07.879 --> 29:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State John Kerry,
thank you very much.

29:13.118 --> 29:20.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: Thank you.

29:21.026 --> 29:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

29:27.466 --> 29:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Happy new year, gentlemen.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Happy new year,
Judy.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good seeing you
in 2017.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's start by talking about
this intelligence
report.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, the entire intelligence
community is
behind it.

29:41.880 --> 29:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying without a shadow
of a doubt,
in so many words, they are
confident the Russians

29:47.219 --> 29:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to interfere in the U.S.
election and
they developed a clear
preference for Donald

29:51.623 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

29:52.991 --> 29:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of this?

29:54.159 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does it change the way we look
at this election?

29:56.361 --> 29:59.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know if it
changes the
way we look at it, Judy.

29:59.498 --> 30:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It certainly changes the way we
look at the
United States' relationship with
Russia, I

30:04.603 --> 30:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, and in this sense, that
the intelligence
community said it made these
findings with

30:12.277 --> 30:14.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high confidence.

30:14.046 --> 30:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since the weapons of mass
destruction
era and the decision on invading
Iraq, the

30:22.454 --> 30:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence community has been
very, very
careful to avoid high
confidence.

30:26.058 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's saying, we really believe
this to be
true.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have been more tentative.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was no question.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were unequivocal and
emphatic.

30:34.566 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every American ought to be
angry, ought to
be concerned that an unfriendly
nation, a

30:39.638 --> 30:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation that has cooperated with
us certain
places, but doesn't wish us
well, sought to

30:47.913 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sabotage American democracy,
American confidence
in our own democratic
institutions, and to

30:53.585 --> 30:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
influence the outcome of the
election.

30:56.488 --> 31:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a cause of concern and
worry and anger.

31:00.058 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would hope that we would
respond, not
as Democrats or Republicans, but
as Americans,

31:04.596 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make sure it never happens
again.

31:05.897 --> 31:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how should
Americans
look at this?

31:07.999 --> 31:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that,
with anger,
with shock.

31:10.068 --> 31:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have sort of gotten used to
the idea, because
of the news leaks before this
report.

31:14.239 --> 31:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea that Russia felt
emboldened and
apparently fearless to go into
our election

31:18.510 --> 31:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and manipulate our own election
process, whether
successfully or not, is a sign
that they are

31:23.515 --> 31:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside the norms of normal
society.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's always statecraft.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's always disinformation.

31:27.853 --> 31:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a step up, a Russia
that feels
completely free to do this, a
Putin who feels

31:31.890 --> 31:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely free to do this,
without fear of
penalty, and so far paying
little penalty.

31:36.228 --> 31:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Partly, it's motivated, I think,
by animus
toward Hillary Clinton, as we
heard earlier

31:40.732 --> 31:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the program, things she said
in 2011, 2012,
partly, frankly, a desire, a
belief that feeling

31:46.905 --> 31:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump will be tougher on
ISIS.

31:49.241 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing that should most
concern us
is a shift in American foreign
policy.

31:53.712 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had a bipartisan belief
in American
foreign policy based on the
post-World War

31:57.649 --> 32:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
II institutions that believed in
democratic
global world, which Russia and
the Soviet

32:03.188 --> 32:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Union was often seen as hostile
to.

32:05.524 --> 32:10.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And most Republicans and
Democrats have always
basically believed in this world
order.

32:10.061 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin
and maybe
Marine Le Pen do not agree with
this basic

32:15.033 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
structure of the world.

32:16.868 --> 32:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They seem to have no respect for
the institutions
that were created after World
War II, and

32:21.506 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they see a potential alliance of
populists
around the world who would fight
Islam and

32:26.178 --> 32:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restore a certain semblance of
traditional
values.

32:28.747 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we could be seeing a
pivot in American
foreign policy that may be on
the mind of

32:32.284 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, certainly seems to
be on the
mind of Steve Bannon, his
ideologist.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is a piece of that
larger shift.

32:38.657 --> 32:44.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, Donald
Trump, the
president-elect, does have his
own reaction

32:44.496 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this report.

32:46.331 --> 32:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, joining in
with what David's
saying, I mean, he started out
by calling

32:51.102 --> 32:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it a political witch-hunt.

32:52.971 --> 32:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then after he was briefed
about it, he
said -- he made a very short
comment and said,

32:59.878 --> 33:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in so many words that, well, it
didn't affect
the outcome of the election.

33:03.481 --> 33:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: As usual, he takes
the big picture.

33:08.186 --> 33:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, I won, and
anything that in
any way diminishes or tarnishes
my personal

33:14.259 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
victory, I reject.

33:16.528 --> 33:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His disparagement, make that
disdain, openly,
for the American intelligence
community and

33:22.634 --> 33:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its work is damaging to national
security.

33:28.139 --> 33:33.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, the intelligence
community, for the
security of our nation, for the
well-being

33:33.812 --> 33:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our nation, for the economic
prosperity
of our nation, competitiveness,
depends on

33:39.484 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sources in other places.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And other nations depend upon
our intelligence.

33:43.154 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And here we have the
president-elect dismissing,
disparaging, disdaining openly
because it

33:51.663 --> 33:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somehow, in his way -- his
perspective, diminishes
his victory, is just
astonishing.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's happening on
three levels,
like, this story.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is the big strategic
level, which I
described.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then there's the Donald Trump
ego level.

34:06.745 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his ego is like a comet the
size of Jupiter
just traveling through the solar
system, and

34:10.982 --> 34:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we all have to be affected by
its gravitational
pull.

34:13.184 --> 34:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So all of American foreign
policy has to remind
us that Donald Trump really did
win this election

34:17.289 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all by himself, and nobody else
could have
helped, and so it was all me,
me, me.

34:21.459 --> 34:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that seems to be the center
of his views.

34:23.762 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the third is, this is a
guy who's
going to be taking over a public
office, presidency

34:27.232 --> 34:28.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is going to have a system
built around
him.

34:30.535 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He will have employees.

34:33.338 --> 34:37.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he, as a public servant,
will work with
other public servants,
presumably the intelligence

34:37.876 --> 34:39.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

34:39.711 --> 34:42.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he seems completely
uninterested in being
part of this system which our
founders set

34:42.180 --> 34:43.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

34:43.715 --> 34:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he seems to still be a
lone wolf insulting
his future employees.

34:47.953 --> 34:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, believe me, woe to you who
insults the
intelligence community, if
you're president.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You do not want to get on their
bad side,
because, A, they leak a lot.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
B, you actually need them to
learn about the
world.

34:57.562 --> 35:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he seems to be on purpose
alienating the
resources he's going to have to
draw upon.

35:00.498 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just
heard from
John Kerry, Mark, the world is a
more complicated

35:04.569 --> 35:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
place than it's maybe ever been.

35:07.172 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about the number of
different places
that the U.S. now has to worry
about its relationship

35:14.646 --> 35:16.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

35:16.514 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, we're at this
critical point
where we're changing from one
administration

35:22.387 --> 35:24.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the next.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's always, I guess, a fraught
time, but
it just seems especially so this
time.

35:26.925 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does, and
I think,
in part, because of the reasons
David announced,

35:32.230 --> 35:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
observed earlier, that the
changing sort of
organizing principle of postwar
world and

35:39.604 --> 35:41.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

35:41.373 --> 35:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know, I think, probably
more keenly
and more acutely, the limits of
our power.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I could just add one thing to
David's observation
earlier.

35:49.781 --> 35:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, Judy, I have lived
through an
awful lot of transitions from an
election

35:55.653 --> 35:56.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to inauguration.

35:57.022 --> 36:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a period during which
president-elects
follow a pattern.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They become more popular.

36:03.828 --> 36:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they do is, they submerge
partisanship.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They reach across the line.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They do all sorts of symbolic
things to unite
the nation.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This president-elect has done
just the opposite.

36:14.639 --> 36:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He continued his rallies,
apparently for
self-gratification.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He fired up his true believers.

36:22.180 --> 36:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He continued to disparage and
belittle his
defeated opponent openly.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And toward what end?

36:30.255 --> 36:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been no symbolic reach.

36:32.424 --> 36:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's had interviews, I guess,
with Heidi Heitkamp,
the Democratic senator from
North Dakota.

36:36.694 --> 36:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's been no sense of any
strategic
sense of where the country is
going or what

36:42.767 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's about.

36:44.302 --> 36:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here he is tweeting about Arnold
Schwarzenegger's
ratings on "The Apprentice"?

36:47.405 --> 36:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He's interfering?

36:50.208 --> 36:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's making 12 calls into Ohio
to defeat John
Kasich's Republican state
chairman in the

36:56.714 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican state committee vote.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is pettiness.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is -- this shows just
no largeness
of vision.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is really distressing.

37:05.590 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, yesterday,
David, in conjunction
with this, he tweeted another
criticism, I

37:10.662 --> 37:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guess, of the Senate Democratic
leader, Chuck
Schumer.

37:13.331 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called him the head clown in
talking the
way the Democrats are handling
Obama.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I did interview the vice
president yesterday,
who looked right into the camera
and said,

37:21.773 --> 37:24.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grow up, Donald.

37:24.342 --> 37:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, is that the kind of
comment that's
likely to make a difference, do
you think?

37:28.012 --> 37:29.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: The vice
president?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice
president.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:31.716 --> 37:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm sure
Donald Trump is
growing and maturing as we
speak.

37:35.787 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I -- we have gotten
used to analyzing
presidential statements in a
certain way.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Like, what is the policy
implications?

37:42.727 --> 37:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we take them all very
seriously, because,
when a president speaks, as Mark
said a couple

37:46.264 --> 37:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of weeks ago, that usually means
a lot.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have come to think we have
to treat
Donald Trump's tweets like
Snapchat.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just something that is
going to go away.

37:54.405 --> 37:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it flies out of some region
of his brain
and it goes out into the ether.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And usually it's on the realm of
media.

38:01.746 --> 38:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even in his tweets of Russia, he
was attacking
CNN and NBC for their coverage.

38:05.483 --> 38:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a media commentator a lot
of the time,
even with Schwarzenegger.

38:09.487 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it will exist, and it
will fill conversation
for a moment.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, like Snapchat, it will
just go away.

38:15.360 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, until he can
give us something
real, it's sometimes best to
just let them

38:20.632 --> 38:22.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go with the wind.

38:22.500 --> 38:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when he calls
Chuck Schumer
the head clown, Mark, we just
ignore it, or...

38:28.940 --> 38:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, what does it
help?

38:30.975 --> 38:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does it possibly help?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's going to need Chuck
Schumer.

38:34.612 --> 38:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer is a proud and
able and dedicated
and skillful leader, and you
don't want him

38:41.252 --> 38:42.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as an opponent.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't want him as a sworn
adversary.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's a formidable figure
legislatively.

38:48.893 --> 38:49.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why do it?

38:49.894 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's gratuitous.

38:51.729 --> 38:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Joe Biden interview, of
all sad words
of tongue and pen, these are the
saddest that

38:55.266 --> 38:57.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might have been.

38:57.101 --> 39:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went through an election
where we had the
two least-liked nominees in the
modern history

39:01.339 --> 39:03.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of American polling.

39:03.141 --> 39:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you could not watch the
interview -- and
I commend you for it last night
-- with Joe

39:07.111 --> 39:09.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Biden without saying, I like
this guy.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he is a thoroughly
likable man.

39:12.016 --> 39:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he says, grow up, I
mean, it wasn't
said -- there was nothing mean
about it.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just -- it was absolutely
what a grownup
would say.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a grownup talking.

39:21.326 --> 39:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way I thought he talked
about Democratic
values was missing in the
campaign of 2016,

39:26.130 --> 39:30.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sorely to the Democrats'
disadvantage, it
was just a -- it was a marvelous
-- I commend

39:30.969 --> 39:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to anybody who missed it for
any reason
to watch it online.

39:34.439 --> 39:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things
I talked
to the vice president about,
David, was Obamacare

39:39.544 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what the Republicans are
going to do about
it.

39:43.314 --> 39:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration is saying
they're afraid
that they can't make any changes
unless they

39:48.886 --> 39:50.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make bad changes to it.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you see going on with
it?

39:52.590 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First, on the
interview, I was
struck by the way he kept
emphasizing the

39:55.493 --> 39:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats did not campaign on
the dignity
of the working class.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The policies of
the Democratic
Party have always been in
cultural consonance

40:02.567 --> 40:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the culture of the working
class.

40:04.369 --> 40:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, somehow, they missed that.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought he was very
honest.

40:07.705 --> 40:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also on the part of the
interview -- you
saw a man who has been in
governance, as he

40:11.109 --> 40:13.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
said, since he was 27.

40:13.077 --> 40:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you're in governance,
you understand
the limitations and the
complexities of governance.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's hard.

40:18.016 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Obamacare, I'm not sure
the Trump administration
has thought in any complex way
about how to

40:23.921 --> 40:25.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
repeal and replace.

40:25.857 --> 40:31.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Repealing first and then
replacing later doesn't
strike me -- and a lot of the
Republican health

40:31.062 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care experts I talk to --
doesn't strike them
as just a workable thing to do.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You repeal some of the things,
like maybe
the -- some of the premium
supports that are

40:38.703 --> 40:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Obamacare, and then you
replace it with
something later, that seems
likely in the

40:43.341 --> 40:47.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short term to create exactly the
sort of death
spiral and destabilization that
we're all

40:47.779 --> 40:49.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worried about.

40:49.681 --> 40:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it seems to me and it
seems to a growing
number of Republican senators,
including Bob

40:52.884 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corker and John McCain, that you
have got
to repeal and replace at the
same time.

40:56.721 --> 41:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to have a plan, or else
you're just
creating a recipe for chaos.

41:00.758 --> 41:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not clear how much
either the House
leadership or the Trump
administration has

41:05.029 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought that through how exactly
how it's
going to work.

41:07.498 --> 41:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds,
Mark.

41:08.933 --> 41:09.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be watching.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What's the big
rush, Judy?

41:11.269 --> 41:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the big rush on the
health care plan?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been eight years.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So they have had a lot of ideas.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, Paul Ryan said that.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have got ideas everywhere.

41:20.878 --> 41:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have no idea what they're
going to do.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Repeal is low-hanging fruit.

41:25.817 --> 41:26.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have done it.

41:26.818 --> 41:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have done it 60 times.

41:27.819 --> 41:28.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They will do it 60 more.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have no plan.

41:30.221 --> 41:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you both.

41:40.264 --> 41:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you both.

41:45.136 --> 41:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the latest story in our
series about food
in America, a collaboration
between the "NewsHour"

41:51.175 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and NPR.

41:52.977 --> 41:58.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, our focus is on
seafood, and specifically
a movement to ensure sustainable
seafood.

41:58.349 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That means fish caught
domestically and locally,
and not fished to extinction.

42:04.021 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the vast expanse of
shoreline in this
country, more than 90 percent of
the seafood

42:08.626 --> 42:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans eat is imported.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many conservationists, fishermen
and foodies
are out to change this.

42:15.967 --> 42:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Allison
Aubrey of NPR
News has the story.

42:20.838 --> 42:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, named
for the cod, but that's not what
fisherman

42:26.944 --> 42:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jamie Eldredge is catching
today.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cod's been overfished in these
waters.

42:31.783 --> 42:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he's laying his lines for a
fish that
most American's have never even
heard of.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's called dogfish.

42:40.525 --> 42:41.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And was it a good catch?

42:41.526 --> 42:43.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How much did you land?

42:43.461 --> 42:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE ELDREDGE, Fisherman: It's
a daily limit
of 6,000 pounds, and probably
was just a little

42:45.897 --> 42:47.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shy of it today.

42:47.632 --> 42:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: That fish ends
up here at
this processing plant just up
the road.

42:51.502 --> 42:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is dogfish here, kind
of a long sharky-looking
thing?

42:55.773 --> 42:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIAN MARDER, Owner, Marder
Trawling: Yes.

42:58.042 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, it is the most plentiful
fish we have
on the East Coast right now.

43:01.879 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Owner Brian
Marder says the
Chatham fishermen will bring in
six million

43:06.250 --> 43:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pounds of dogfish this year.

43:08.152 --> 43:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His operation turns that spiky
shark into
long white fillets.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who's buying this fish?

43:13.391 --> 43:16.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN MARDER: This is all being
packed for
the European export market.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: I'm told that
the French love
it.

43:17.728 --> 43:18.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They call it salmonetes.

43:18.729 --> 43:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN MARDER: Salmonete, yes.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Which sounds
kind of fancy.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRIAN MARDER: Yes.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Are you telling
me that everything
being processed here is just
going to be shipped

43:25.636 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out?

43:26.637 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN MARDER: Yes, it is.

43:27.638 --> 43:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Ninety-nine
percent of it?

43:28.639 --> 43:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIAN MARDER: Ninety-nine
percent.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: While all this
dogfish is
shipping out to Europe, where's
the fish that

43:33.811 --> 43:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans like to eat coming
from?

43:37.849 --> 43:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turns out it's being flown in
from countries
around the world, arriving at
warehouses like

43:43.120 --> 43:44.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this one we visited.

43:44.655 --> 43:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Santa Monica Seafood is one of
the largest
distributors on the West Coast.

43:48.526 --> 43:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, they will distribute
42 million
pounds of seafood, much of it
imported.

43:53.364 --> 43:58.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lots of fresh caught seafood
going out and
tons of seafood coming in from
overseas, it's

43:58.169 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a swap that plays out across the
United States,
according to Jennifer Dianto
Kemmerly Bio.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's director of Seafood Watch
at the Monterey
Bay Aquarium.

44:06.377 --> 44:09.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They track and rank
environmentally responsible
fisheries.

44:09.347 --> 44:12.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DIANTO KEMMERLY,
Monterey Bay Aquarium:
Over 90 percent of the seafood
we consume

44:12.216 --> 44:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. is actually caught
or farm-raised
overseas.

44:16.487 --> 44:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the majority of the seafood
that we catch
in our U.S. fisheries doesn't
stay here in

44:20.157 --> 44:21.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our local market.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It goes to other countries.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Does that make
sense?

44:24.061 --> 44:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DIANTO KEMMERLY: We're
kind of missing
out on the bounty that we
actually have here.

44:26.931 --> 44:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not celebrating the local
fisheries
as much as we probably should
be.

44:30.935 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: And that bounty
is so plentiful,
the Environmental Defense Fund
has launched

44:35.506 --> 44:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a campaign to get Americans
eating these lesser-known
species from our own coastal
waters.

44:41.612 --> 44:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Eat These Fish is a
campaign to
celebrate the comeback of
America's fisheries.

44:46.183 --> 44:51.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALLISON AUBREY: Like New
England's overfished
cod, fisheries around the U.S.
were being

44:51.722 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
depleted.

44:53.558 --> 44:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After environmentalists sounded
alarm bells,
Congress passed an act in 2006
that required

44:57.595 --> 45:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fisheries to set quotas by 2011.

45:00.831 --> 45:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now fisheries have rebounded.

45:02.934 --> 45:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy Civetta is with the Cape
Cod Commercial
Fishermen's Alliance.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been trying to promote the
story of
dogfish.

45:10.007 --> 45:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says even with all the
demand from Europe,
there's still plenty left here
for Americans

45:15.112 --> 45:16.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to eat.

45:16.948 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY CIVETTA, Cape Cod
Commercial Fishermen's
Alliance: There's so many out
there, that

45:18.182 --> 45:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't even catch the quota
the government
allows us.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: But here's the
challenge.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY CIVETTA: We don't eat
dogfish in this
country.

45:24.956 --> 45:29.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We import salmon, tuna and
shrimp.

45:29.493 --> 45:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do not eat the food that
we're bringing
to shore right here.

45:33.297 --> 45:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Civetta says
importing most
of the fish we eat could have
consequences

45:38.803 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down the line.

45:40.571 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CIVETTA: If we continue to
import and
buy from other countries, then
our fishing

45:45.209 --> 45:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
industry could wither away.

45:47.044 --> 45:52.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're going to maximize the
potential of
this fishery, then we need to
create markets,

45:52.183 --> 45:56.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that the fisherman can fish
for it, they
can better their bottom lines,
and we can

45:56.487 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a sustainable coastal
community.

45:58.289 --> 46:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN DIMIN, Sea to Table: So
what they do
is they lay down on the bottom
of the ocean.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Sean Dimin runs
a company
called Sea to Table that he says
is doing

46:07.565 --> 46:09.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just that.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN DIMIN: We come out here to
places like
Chatham, fishing communities all
around America's

46:12.603 --> 46:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coasts, and we figure out how to
get the best
directly to chefs, universities,
distributing

46:18.042 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directly from the point of catch
to the point
of consumption.

46:23.547 --> 46:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beautiful photos of the fish
that we can now
sell directly to people's homes.

46:28.552 --> 46:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Back at Sea to
Table's Brooklyn
headquarters, Dimin explains
that his operation

46:33.724 --> 46:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a complete departure from the
traditional
model.

46:36.427 --> 46:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN DIMIN: A big thing that we
do is sell
fish that fishermen are
catching, not necessarily

46:42.667 --> 46:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what American consumers and
diners think they
want.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a big part of what we
do is supporting
American fishing communities.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: That's beautiful.

46:50.307 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: And the model
aligns perfectly
with a big push at university
dining halls

46:55.980 --> 46:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to source their foods from more
local and
sustainable sources.

46:59.116 --> 47:01.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: On the count of three, say
dogfish.

47:01.052 --> 47:04.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: This group runs
the dining
halls at the University of
Massachusetts.

47:04.622 --> 47:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They serve 55,000 meals a day.

47:08.392 --> 47:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have made a commitment to
bring this
dogfish and other underloved
fish back to

47:13.564 --> 47:15.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their campus.

47:15.366 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's at university dining halls
like this
one, where thousands of people
eat every day,

47:19.637 --> 47:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you might be able to shake
things up.

47:21.739 --> 47:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These students are used to
trying new things,
and a lot of them love the
novelty of it.

47:27.378 --> 47:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what's the appeal here?

47:28.946 --> 47:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why go out of the way to buy
dogfish?

47:31.215 --> 47:34.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BANKERT, Chef, University of
Massachusetts:
Being in Western Massachusetts,
we love to

47:34.251 --> 47:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support the Massachusetts
fisheries, and that
it tastes great.

47:37.755 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: University of
Massachusetts
chef Bob Bankert is grilling
dogfish fillets.

47:42.827 --> 47:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's lathered them in a spicy
seasoning to
make tacos.

47:48.365 --> 47:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At another food station, the
dogfish becomes
an Asian flash fry.

47:52.737 --> 47:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's drizzled with wasabi mayo
on top.

47:57.007 --> 47:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The students are curious.

47:58.876 --> 48:03.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A display tells them where the
dogfish comes
from and who caught it.

48:03.981 --> 48:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Selina Fournier is manager of
this dining
hall.

48:05.983 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SELINA FOURNIER, Dining Hall
Manager, University
of Massachusetts: There's
students that may

48:07.785 --> 48:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have never heard of such a fish,
and so when
they saw the fish here today,
and then got

48:12.022 --> 48:17.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to taste it, the whole
association really
creates that story and bringing
it to life,

48:17.461 --> 48:21.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hopefully creating something
exciting
that they will want to order
even when they're

48:21.132 --> 48:22.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not at UMass.

48:22.967 --> 48:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Is that your
hope, that you're
sort of setting a new generation
of eating

48:25.269 --> 48:26.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
habits here?

48:26.270 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SELINA FOURNIER: Definitely.

48:28.105 --> 48:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are setting the standard for
the way that
these students hopefully
continue their health

48:31.842 --> 48:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and wellness once they graduate
UMass.

48:34.044 --> 48:35.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Thank you.

48:35.813 --> 48:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Ruth Crawford
(ph) and Ana
Yrazusta (ph) went for the Asian
flash fry.

48:38.883 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, give it a try.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us what you think.

48:42.953 --> 48:44.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

48:44.588 --> 48:45.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It's so good.

48:45.856 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Amazing.

48:47.057 --> 48:48.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: What's the
biggest appeal
to you here?

48:48.726 --> 48:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: It's new, local, fresh,
so healthy.

48:52.029 --> 48:56.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Sea to Table
already has about
1,000 customers, including
dozens of large

48:56.967 --> 48:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universities and restaurant
chefs.

48:59.403 --> 49:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're also planning to
roll out direct-to-consumer
delivery, so people can get fish
delivered

49:04.408 --> 49:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right to their front door.

49:06.177 --> 49:09.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And are you hoping now that, 10
years from
now, most Americans know what
dogfish is?

49:09.747 --> 49:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIE ELDREDGE: Well, we hope
so.

49:11.715 --> 49:13.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:13.551 --> 49:16.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Fishermen like
Jamie Eldredge
are eager to see if companies
like Sea to

49:16.620 --> 49:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Table can capture the taste buds
of the next
generation.

49:20.157 --> 49:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Allison Aubrey of NPR News
for the "PBS
NewsHour" in Chatham,
Massachusetts.

49:31.468 --> 49:40.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally:
Professor Christopher
Emdin teaches at Columbia
University's Teachers

49:40.911 --> 49:42.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
College.

49:42.746 --> 49:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He explains why there are so few
African-American
males teaching our children in
tonight's In

49:47.751 --> 49:49.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My Humble Opinion.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER EMDIN, Professor,
Columbia University
Teachers College: So, when
"NewsHour" asked

49:51.989 --> 49:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me to write and deliver this
essay about why
there are so few black male
teachers, I was

49:56.727 --> 49:57.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
excited.

49:57.728 --> 49:59.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I agreed.

49:59.463 --> 50:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I then realized that I
needed to discuss
this issue by presenting it in a
way that

50:02.600 --> 50:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of exemplifies the problem.

50:04.201 --> 50:07.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the problem is that no one's
really listening.

50:07.171 --> 50:12.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for this essay, you're going
to have to
listen, but do so in a little
bit of a different

50:12.610 --> 50:14.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

50:14.478 --> 50:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, like some other black
cultural values
and modes of expression that
black male teachers

50:17.915 --> 50:22.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their students share and
have in common,
hip-hop is demonized by the
public, and then

50:22.453 --> 50:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it is devalued in schools.

50:24.288 --> 50:30.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whether we're talking about
dance, dress,
slang, entertainment, we have
these forms

50:30.728 --> 50:34.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of culture that need to be
accepted, with
some limits, of course, in
schools.

50:34.965 --> 50:38.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we do that to engage
students and then
to retain teachers.

50:38.903 --> 50:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they are not accepted,
students underperform,
teachers get frustrated, and
then they leave.

50:46.977 --> 50:52.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
See, black youth drop out, get
suspended at
higher rates.

50:52.116 --> 50:55.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schools react about that fact,
so they hire
a black face.

50:55.753 --> 50:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Black male went through hell,
dodged a cell,
got a degree.

50:59.256 --> 51:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
School is excited he got hired.

51:01.392 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They gave him some mentees.

51:03.227 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, these mentees breeze
through P.E. with
ease, but at best see C's if the
course talks

51:09.133 --> 51:15.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degrees or ratio, proportions,
because math
is boring, the language is
anguish.

51:15.105 --> 51:17.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They languish in their
performance.

51:17.341 --> 51:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frustrated, they updated their
thug image,
stuck in the sewage cultural
irrelevance created.

51:23.647 --> 51:26.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Poor instruction, boring
structures.

51:26.050 --> 51:28.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then I'm called in to rupture.

51:28.152 --> 51:29.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm overwhelmed.

51:29.153 --> 51:30.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, I'm black.

51:30.955 --> 51:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the kids are black, too, but
what I know
is right to do means breaking
the school's

51:35.125 --> 51:36.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

51:36.894 --> 51:41.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we leave the profession in
every major
city, 40 percent in Chicago, 19
in Philly,

51:41.532 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
really.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We can't stand being the
teachers that we
hated, but they made us suspend
them and punish

51:45.903 --> 51:47.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them with bad grades.

51:47.738 --> 51:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school system is more
diverse than ever,
but I never see myself amongst
the faculty.

51:51.742 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether I do or not doesn't
make much
of a difference if you hire me,
retire me,

51:57.081 --> 51:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and do not change the system.

51:59.049 --> 52:03.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listen, like 50 percent of
public school students
of color, right?

52:03.721 --> 52:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighty-two percent of those
teachers are,
the other, white.

52:05.889 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Less than 2 percent of those who
teach are
black males.

52:08.425 --> 52:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One in 15 of those same males
end up in jail.

52:11.695 --> 52:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schools criminalize, and society
despises
us.

52:14.865 --> 52:17.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the black male teacher,
frustrations rise
in us.

52:17.468 --> 52:20.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, students respond in anger
and hate schools.

52:20.270 --> 52:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then the teachers respond and
start tightening
up the rules.

52:23.707 --> 52:26.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Test prep begets yet even more
frustration.

52:26.677 --> 52:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I prep them for a test they
detest, so they
fail it.

52:30.714 --> 52:35.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then I get blamed and nailed to
the cross,
as if I'm the cause of it.

52:35.486 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, of course, I feel I'm forced
to quit.

52:37.721 --> 52:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The source of this often sits at
the precipice
of pessimists who get to spit a
less legit

52:44.728 --> 52:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hypothesis about my grit, when
it's obvious
that I am forced to fit in a
system.

52:54.071 --> 53:00.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I quit.

53:00.411 --> 53:09.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in later
tonight on "Washington
Week": an in-depth look at the
ongoing power

53:09.086 --> 53:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plays between president-elect

53:14.191 --> 53:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration over national
security, health
care and immigration reform.

53:19.129 --> 53:21.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's later tonight on
"Washington Week."

53:21.732 --> 53:27.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: how health
insurance under the Affordable
Care Act may

53:27.571 --> 53:30.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change in one state.

53:30.174 --> 53:31.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday.

53:31.909 --> 53:33.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:33.744 --> 53:34.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:34.745 --> 53:35.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:35.746 --> 53:50.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
