02:25.367 --> 02:28.300
ASSUME THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBL

02:28.300 --> 02:30.967
FOR IRAN, LIKE ANY COUNTRY, TO

02:30.967 --> 02:31.767
CHANGE OVER TIME

02:31.767 --> 02:34.867
I WOULDN'T SAY IT IS MORE THAN

02:51.200 --> 02:53.567
THE VIOLENCE IS WORSE THAN A

02:53.567 --> 02:55.467
ANY TIME SINCE 2006 WHEN THE

02:55.467 --> 03:01.400
COUNTRY WAS ON THE VERGE O

GOVERNMENT MOVE AHEAD WITH A

03:18.400 --> 03:20.600
DEAL TO DEEPEN TIES TO THE WEST.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.567
THE PLAN ANGERED RUSSIA TO THE

POWER OUTAGES IN TEXAS HAS MOVED

03:31.700 --> 03:32.200

A SPOKESWOMAN FOR EMERGENC

03:34.167 --> 03:36.633
MANAGEMENT IN VIRGINIA WARNED OF

03:36.633 --> 03:41.200
WHAT SHE CALLED A HISTORIC ICE

03:41.200 --> 03:41.400
EVENT.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.667
THE STORM SENT SNOW TO

03:45.667 --> 03:45.800
PHILADELPHIA

A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL

03:49.233 --> 03:51.567
TEACHERS, AN OPENLY GAY MAN,

AFTER HE APPLIED FOR A NEW

03:56.467 --> 04:02.633
JERSEY LICENSE TO WED HI

04:02.633 --> 04:03.433
PARTNER.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.000
>>> A DISTANT REMINDER OF WORL

04:06.000 --> 04:06.367
WAR II

04:06.367 --> 04:10.600
AN UNEXPLODED ONE-TON GERMAN

04:10.600 --> 04:13.467
BOMB WAS UNCOVERED 20 FEET UNDER

04:13.467 --> 04:14.967
THE GROUND AT A CONSTRUCTION

04:14.967 --> 04:16.367
SITE IN SERBIA

04:16.367 --> 04:19.200
IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCEN

04:19.200 --> 04:20.800
AND DESTROYED.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.633
>>> NOW RETURN TO IRAN WHERE

04:22.633 --> 04:26.167
U.N. INSPECTORS VISITED A SITE

04:26.167 --> 04:28.533
USED TO PRODUCE PLUTONIUM THAT

04:28.533 --> 04:30.867
COULD BE USED IN A NUCLEAR

04:30.867 --> 04:31.733
WEAPON

04:31.733 --> 04:36.100
WE ARE JOINED IN WASHINGTON BY

04:36.100 --> 04:39.067
DAVID ALBRIGHT

04:39.067 --> 04:41.733
HE IS A LEADING EXPERT

04:41.733 --> 04:45.300
THE INSPECTORS ARE VISITING

04:45.300 --> 04:46.200
HEAVY WATER PRODUCTION PLANT

04:46.200 --> 04:47.833
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FO

04:47.833 --> 04:48.833
SPECIFICALLY AT THIS PLANT

04:48.833 --> 04:51.200
>> THIS IS A VISIT BY TH

04:51.200 --> 04:51.333
INSPECTORS

04:51.333 --> 04:53.800
SO THEY ARE LOOKING FOR VERY

04:53.800 --> 04:55.333
SIMPLE THINGS.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.000
IS THE PLANT OPERATIONAL

04:57.000 --> 04:58.700
HOW MUCH HEAVY WATER HAS I

04:58.700 --> 04:58.867
MADE

04:58.867 --> 05:01.300
THEY WILL TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT

05:01.300 --> 05:04.200
ITS PURPOSE IS, I WOULD IMAGINE.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.667
IRAN HAS SAID IT HAS MADE ENOUGH

05:06.667 --> 05:09.500
HEAVY WATER FOR THE ADJACENT

05:09.500 --> 05:11.267
HEAVY WATER PRODUCTION REACTOR

05:11.267 --> 05:13.700
SO WHY DOES IT NEED TO OPERATE

05:13.700 --> 05:14.700
THE HEAVY WATER PRODUCTION

05:14.700 --> 05:14.833
PLANT?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.633
IS IT GOING TO EXPORT IT

05:16.633 --> 05:18.900
IS IT PLANNING TO BUILD MORE

05:18.900 --> 05:20.667
HEAVY WATER REACTORS

05:20.667 --> 05:22.233
THE PLANT IS PART OF THE TWO

05:22.233 --> 05:24.867
FACILITIES INCLUDING THE

05:24.867 --> 05:28.167
REACTORER THAT U.N. SECURITY

05:28.167 --> 05:28.500
COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS HAVE ASKED

05:28.500 --> 05:32.600
TO HAVE OPERATIONS SUSPENDED

05:32.600 --> 05:32.767
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THIS

05:32.767 --> 05:35.933
PLANT IS ALSO ON THE LIST OF

05:35.933 --> 05:37.533
PLANTS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS

05:37.533 --> 05:40.267
LIKELY GOING TO WANT TO SEE SHUT

05:40.267 --> 05:41.533
DOWN IF THERE IS A FINAL DEA

05:41.533 --> 05:42.733
WITH IRAN.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.733
AND THIS KIND OF VISIT CREATES A

05:44.733 --> 05:48.433
BASELINE OF WHAT IS GOING ON

05:48.433 --> 05:50.967
THERE AND IT WILL HELP ESTABLISH

05:50.967 --> 05:52.700
WHERE THE PLANT IS NEEDED.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.467
>> TODAY IS A ONE DAY EVENT AT

05:54.467 --> 05:55.767
ONE PLACE.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.067
ULTIMATELY, HOW MANY INSPECTIONS

05:57.067 --> 06:00.667
WILL TAKE PLACE?

06:00.667 --> 06:03.900
>> FOR THE AGENDA OF THE AGENC

06:03.900 --> 06:06.333
THIS IS A SMALL, IMPORTANT STEP.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.833
THEY WILL HAVE TO VISI

06:09.833 --> 06:11.100
MILITARY-RELATED SITES RELATED

06:11.100 --> 06:14.067
TO PAST AND ON GOING WORK.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.533
THE SITE HAS A FACILITY THAT I

06:16.533 --> 06:22.900
LINKED TO OLD WORK ON NUCLEA

06:22.900 --> 06:23.300
WEAPONS.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.467
AND IN THAT PERIOD OF DENIAL

06:26.467 --> 06:29.300
IRAN HAS ESSENTIALLY REBUILT THE

06:29.300 --> 06:31.067
SITE AND IT WILL MAKE THE JO

06:31.067 --> 06:32.767
HARDERER TO VERIFY WHAT HAPPENED

06:32.767 --> 06:34.167
THERE IN THE PAST.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.000
AND THAT MEANS THEY WILL WANT TO

06:36.000 --> 06:38.200
TALK TO PEOPLE AND GO TO OTHER

06:38.200 --> 06:40.700
SITES THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO

06:40.700 --> 06:43.367
NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATIO

06:43.367 --> 06:43.500
ALLEGATIONS.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.800
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG

06:45.800 --> 06:48.267
DIFFICULT PROCESS AND WILL

06:48.267 --> 06:49.633
DEPEND ON IRAN COOPERATING WIT

06:49.633 --> 06:51.267
THE INSPECTORS

06:51.267 --> 06:53.900
>> WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF

06:53.900 --> 06:55.567
IRAN CONCEALING THE NUCLEA

06:55.567 --> 06:55.700
PROGRAM?

06:55.700 --> 06:57.367
>> I DON'T THINK IT HAS DONE A

06:57.367 --> 06:58.767
VERY GOOD JOB.

06:58.767 --> 07:02.400
THE EVIDENCE ASSEMBLED FOR MAN

07:02.400 --> 07:04.500
MEMBER STATES IS THEY HAD

07:04.500 --> 07:05.300
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IN THE

07:05.300 --> 07:07.333
PAST AND PARTS OF IT MAY HAV

07:07.333 --> 07:07.533
CONTINUED.

07:07.533 --> 07:10.100
THE PROBLEM IS IRAN ABSOLUTELY

07:10.100 --> 07:14.233
DENIES IT, CALLS THE INFORMATION

07:14.233 --> 07:15.833
FABRICATED, MISINTERPRETED AND

07:15.833 --> 07:17.533
HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THEY HAVE

07:17.533 --> 07:19.767
NEVER HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON

07:19.767 --> 07:20.067
PROGRAM.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.300
I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY

07:21.300 --> 07:23.900
GOOD AND IRAN WILL HAVE TO

07:23.900 --> 07:25.800
CHANGE ITS APPROACH AND START TO

07:25.800 --> 07:27.033
ADDRESS THE CONCERN.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.667
IT CAN DO IT IN SECRET

07:28.667 --> 07:31.400
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A PUBLIC

07:31.400 --> 07:31.633
DISCUSSION

07:31.633 --> 07:33.933
THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR IRAN TO,

07:33.933 --> 07:36.267
IN A SENSE, COME CLEAN AND

07:36.267 --> 07:37.533
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

07:37.533 --> 07:39.500
IT CAN'T ESCAPE IT

07:39.500 --> 07:40.567
IT WILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO

07:40.567 --> 07:43.000
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

07:43.000 --> 07:46.100
AND THE RECENT JOINT PLAN OF

07:46.100 --> 07:49.833
ACTION NEGOTIATED REITERATES

07:49.833 --> 07:51.200
THAT THE CONCERNS WILL HAVE TO

07:51.200 --> 07:52.467
BE ADDRESSED IF THERE IS GOING

07:52.467 --> 07:54.200
TO BE A FINAL DEAL

07:54.200 --> 07:56.533
>> HOW MUCH IS TODAY'S

07:56.533 --> 07:58.200
INSPECTION A GESTURE OR A TEST

07:58.200 --> 08:00.733
OF IRAN'S COOPERATION GOIN

08:00.733 --> 08:00.967
FORWARD?

08:00.967 --> 08:03.233
>> I THINK IT IS A GOOD GESTUR

08:03.233 --> 08:04.100
BY IRAN.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.300
THEY HAVEN'T ALLOWED THE

08:07.300 --> 08:09.367
INSPECTORS INTO THE PLANT SINC

08:09.367 --> 08:09.667
2011

08:09.667 --> 08:11.767
THE VISIT BEFORET THAT WAS I

08:11.767 --> 08:12.033
2005

08:12.033 --> 08:16.000
I THINK IT IS A GOOD GESTURE B

08:16.000 --> 08:17.667
IRAN AND SETS UP WHAT YOU HAVE

08:17.667 --> 08:21.267
TO LOOK AT AS A VERY DIFFICULT

08:21.267 --> 08:22.167
PROCESS BUT A POSITIVE PROCESS

08:22.167 --> 08:24.167
IN THAT IRAN APPEARS TO BE

08:24.167 --> 08:25.300
WILLING TO OPEN UP

08:25.300 --> 08:28.533
IT IS GOING TO BE SORELY TESTE

08:28.533 --> 08:29.900
IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS

08:29.900 --> 08:34.200
YOU HAVE TO VIEW TODAY'S SUCCESS

08:34.200 --> 08:37.033
AS GIVING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.

08:37.033 --> 08:56.000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH

08:56.000 --> 08:57.933

09:18.767 --> 09:22.133
DIED THURSDAY.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.633
NELSON MANDELA UNDERSTOOD THAT

09:23.633 --> 09:26.067
ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST POPULAR

09:26.067 --> 09:29.467
SPORTS, RUGBY, COULD PLAY A BI

09:29.467 --> 09:34.000
ROLE IN BRIDGING SOUTH AFRICA'

09:34.000 --> 09:35.233
RACIAL DIVIDE.

09:35.233 --> 09:39.467
>> RUGBY WAS ALSO DIVISIVE,

09:39.467 --> 09:42.500
SYMBOL OF APARTHEID.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.433
TO MANDELA IT WAS AN

09:44.433 --> 09:44.567
OPPORTUNITY.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.967
IT WAS JUST A YEAR INTO HI

09:46.967 --> 09:47.567
PRESIDENCY

09:47.567 --> 09:55.533
NO ONE EXPECTED HIM TO DON THE

09:55.533 --> 09:56.967
GREEN AND GOLD OF THE JERSEY

09:56.967 --> 09:59.067
JUST LISTEN TO THE REACTION OF

AND WHEN SOUTH AFRICA BEAT THE

10:10.067 --> 10:13.200
COUNTRY CELEBRATED AS ONE.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.600

10:16.600 --> 10:17.733
UNPRECEDENTED UNITY.
