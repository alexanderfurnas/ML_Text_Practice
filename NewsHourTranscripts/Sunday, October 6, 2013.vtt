01:10.933 --> 01:14.633
AMERICA WILL HOLD THOS

01:14.633 --> 01:19.700
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO ATTACK

01:19.700 --> 01:21.567
THEY CAN RUN BUT THEY CAN'

01:21.567 --> 01:21.733
HIDE

01:21.733 --> 01:23.833
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO BRING

01:23.833 --> 01:27.033
PEOPLE TO JUSTICE IN APPROPRIATE

01:27.033 --> 01:31.433

>> WORD OF THE RAIDS CONDUCTED

01:39.600 --> 01:42.367
FIRST TRICKLED OUT YESTERDAY

01:42.367 --> 01:42.633
EVENING.

01:42.633 --> 01:46.267
IN LIBYA AMERICAN COMMAND DOES

01:46.267 --> 01:54.500
WITH FBI AND CIA AGENTS CA

01:54.500 --> 01:59.233
CAPTURED A HIGH RANKING AL QAEDA

01:59.233 --> 01:59.500
LEADER

01:59.500 --> 02:04.400
THE PENTAGON ISSUED A STATEMEN

02:04.400 --> 02:09.200
TODAY SAID AL LIBI HAD BEE

02:09.200 --> 02:11.967
INDICTED IN A U.S. FEDERAL COURT

02:11.967 --> 02:18.067
IN 2000 IN CONNECTION WITH

02:18.067 --> 02:18.767
ATTACKS.

02:18.767 --> 02:24.400
BUT THE RAID IN SOMALIA BY NAV

02:24.400 --> 02:26.633
S.E.A.L.S WAS RETALIATION FO

02:26.633 --> 02:38.333
THE AL SHABAAB MILITANT GROUP ON

02:38.333 --> 02:39.133
A MALL IN KENYA.

02:39.133 --> 02:42.867
THEY ENGAGED IN AN HOUR-LONG

02:42.867 --> 02:50.367
FIRE FIGHT WITH MILITANTS BEFORE

02:50.367 --> 02:50.600
WITHDRAWING.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.533
THE TEAM WAS FORCED TO WITHDRA

02:53.533 --> 02:56.100
BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO CONFIR

02:56.100 --> 02:58.333
THAT IT HAD KILLED IT'S TARGET

02:58.333 --> 03:01.167
SO, I HAVE TO ASK, HOW DEAL IS

03:01.167 --> 03:11.567
THE PRESENCE OF ISLAMIC MILL

03:11.567 --> 03:12.533
MILITANCY NOW?

03:12.533 --> 03:15.800
>> FOR YEARS AMERICA HAS FEARE

03:15.800 --> 03:18.767
THE SMALL CONFLICTS AND SECURITY

03:18.767 --> 03:23.167
VACUUMS WOULD ALLOW AL QAEDA T

03:23.167 --> 03:25.767
IMBED ITSELF IN THESE LOCAL WARS

03:25.767 --> 03:28.533
AND USE THEM TO TARGET AMERICA

03:28.533 --> 03:29.100
INTERESTS.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.833
SO FAR THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED

03:30.833 --> 03:32.900
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, IT HA

03:32.900 --> 03:35.500
BECOME MORE AND MORE OF

03:35.500 --> 03:37.600
REALITY AND IN THE WESTGAT

03:37.600 --> 03:40.800
ATTACK IN WHICH AL QAEDA FORCE

03:40.800 --> 03:44.467
COORDINATED WITH THE LOCAL REBEL

03:44.467 --> 03:46.867
MOVEMENT INDICATES THAT TH

03:46.867 --> 03:49.267
THREAT MAY BE VERY REAL.

03:49.267 --> 03:52.367
ARE THEY MOVING OUT OF SOMALIA

03:52.367 --> 03:56.567
AND ACROSS LIBYA AND

03:56.567 --> 04:01.167
ING FOOTHOLDS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

04:01.167 --> 04:01.733
AS WELL?

04:01.733 --> 04:05.933
>> AL SHABAAB IS THE GROUP THA

04:05.933 --> 04:09.967
IS THOUGHT TO HAVE COMMITTED THE

04:09.967 --> 04:10.133
ATTACK

04:10.133 --> 04:13.500
THEY ARE NOT KNOWN TO HAVE

04:13.500 --> 04:17.233
TIES IN LIBYA OR MALI.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.467
IT IS LIKELY THAT A GROU

04:19.467 --> 04:22.033
WORKING WITH THEM HAD THOS

04:22.033 --> 04:23.000
CONTACTS

04:23.000 --> 04:26.900
AT THIS POINT YOU ARE LOOKING AT

04:26.900 --> 04:43.867
A SHABAAB ATTACKING UGANDA AND

04:43.867 --> 04:44.467
ETHIOPIA AS PART OF THE WAR ON

04:44.467 --> 04:44.667
TERROR

04:44.667 --> 04:45.867
>> DO THESE COUNTRIES BECOME OUR

04:45.867 --> 04:48.533
NEW FRONT LINES FOR THE WAR ON

04:48.533 --> 04:48.667
TERROR

04:48.667 --> 04:52.800
>> WELL, THESE COUNTRIES ARE

04:52.800 --> 04:54.933
EXCUSES BASICALLY.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.133
THE SMALL CONFLICTS THAT ARE

04:57.133 --> 05:00.467
TAKING PLACE ON THE LOCAL LEVE

05:00.467 --> 05:04.967
ALLOW AL QAEDA TO INFILTRATE

05:04.967 --> 05:06.500
THESE PLACES

05:06.500 --> 05:09.033
THEY HAVE REASONS TO WORK WITH

05:09.033 --> 05:13.100
AL QAEDA OPERATIVES.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.633
OVER THE YEARS, AL QAEDA HAS

05:15.633 --> 05:20.033
BEEN UNABLE TO OPERATE IN OTHE

05:20.033 --> 05:21.333
COUNTRIES.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.433
IT WAS A REASON FOR AL QAEDA T

05:24.433 --> 05:28.367
PERSUADE SOMALI THAT KENYA WAS

05:28.367 --> 05:32.633
AN ENEMY AND DESERVING OF AN

05:32.633 --> 05:32.900
ATTACK

05:32.900 --> 05:34.667
AND THE QUESTION FOR THE UNITE

05:34.667 --> 05:38.033
STATES IS, HOW SUCCESSFUL WILL

05:38.033 --> 05:41.300
AL QAEDA CONTINUE TO BE AT USING

05:41.300 --> 05:44.167
AFRICA'S SMALL WARS TO HURT U.S.

05:44.167 --> 05:44.433
INTERESTS?

05:44.433 --> 05:47.000
>> WHAT ARE THE U.S. INTERESTS

05:47.000 --> 05:52.500
IN GOING AFTER THEM WHAT ARE OUR

05:52.500 --> 05:54.800
THREATS DOE MESSICALLY

05:54.800 --> 05:57.767
>> I THINK THERE ARE VERY LITTLE

05:57.767 --> 05:59.300
THREATS AT THIS POINT.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.433
50 SOMALIS WHO HAVE U.S.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.867
PASSPORTS HAVE LEFT THE UNITED

06:05.867 --> 06:08.367
STATES AND GONE TO SOMALIA

06:08.367 --> 06:10.667
THERE IS A REMOTE POSSIBILIT

06:10.667 --> 06:12.567
THAT THEY WILL COME BACK AND

06:12.567 --> 06:14.500
LAUNCH AND ATTACK.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.933
THE U.S. IS WORRIED ABOUT AL

06:16.933 --> 06:18.600
QAEDA OPERATIVES

06:18.600 --> 06:21.333
THEY ARE COORDINATING WITH THE

06:21.333 --> 06:21.633
RADICALS

06:21.633 --> 06:24.033
THE U.S. HAS LITTLE REASON T

06:24.033 --> 06:28.100
WORRY ABOUT AL SHABAAB ITSEL

06:28.100 --> 06:33.067
BECAUSE IT IS PRIMARILY AN

06:33.067 --> 06:33.333
INSURGESY.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.367
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH

06:34.367 --> 06:36.633
>> THANK YOU

06:36.633 --> 06:39.133
>> THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER

06:39.133 --> 06:42.967
APPARENT TERROR INCIDENT TODAY

06:42.967 --> 06:46.500
THIS ONE IN YEMEN.

06:46.500 --> 06:54.967
GUN MEN ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAPPING.

06:54.967 --> 06:58.200
>> UNDER TERMS OF THE RECENTLY

06:58.200 --> 07:01.867
APPROVED UN SECURITY COUNCIL

07:01.867 --> 07:02.867
RESOLUTION

07:02.867 --> 07:13.100
SYRIA'S ENTIRE CHEMICAL WEAPON

07:13.100 --> 07:16.233
STOCK PILE IS TO BE DESTROYED.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.367
>> PEOPLE WERE KILLED WHEN

07:18.367 --> 07:23.300
POLICE FIRED ON SUPPORTERS O

07:23.300 --> 07:27.467
THE PRESIDENT OF THE MUSLI

07:27.467 --> 07:27.667
BROTHERHOOD.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.900
HE HAD BEEN DEMOCRATICALLY

07:30.900 --> 07:33.067
ELECTED LAST YEAR.

07:33.067 --> 07:35.333
IRAN ARRESTED FOUR PEOPLE THAT

07:35.333 --> 07:38.167
THEY SAID WERE TRYING TO

07:38.167 --> 07:41.333
SABOTAGE ONE OF FOUR PEOPLE.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.367
IRAN HAS BLAMED ISRAEL FOR A

07:44.367 --> 07:47.433
SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS

07:47.433 --> 07:49.933
IN CHINA, ANOTHER DAY OF

07:49.933 --> 07:51.167
HORRIBLE AIR POLLUTION

07:51.167 --> 07:53.267
LEADING TO FLIGHT CANCELLATION

07:53.267 --> 07:55.700
AND DELAYS AND CAUSING HEADACHES

07:55.700 --> 08:01.733
FOR VACATIONERS ON THEIR WAY

08:01.733 --> 08:02.000
HOME

08:02.000 --> 08:04.300
THE CITY HAS MORE THAN 2

08:04.300 --> 08:06.733
MILLION PEOPLE AND FIVE MILLIO

08:06.733 --> 08:07.233
CARS

08:07.233 --> 08:11.000
THE U.S. EMBASSY SAYS THE LEVELS

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
OF POLLUTION ARE HAZARDOUS T

08:14.000 --> 08:17.233
HEALTH AND ISSUED A POLLUTIO

08:17.233 --> 08:17.767
ALERT.

08:17.767 --> 08:20.000
>> BACK AT THE NATION'S CAPITO

08:20.000 --> 08:22.667
TODAY A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHU

08:22.667 --> 08:26.733
DOWN CONTINUES FOR A 6th DAY AND

08:26.733 --> 08:29.567
EFFORTS APPEAR TO BE GOING

08:29.567 --> 08:30.833
NOWHERE.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.067
THAT COULD HAPPEN 11 DAYS FROM

08:33.067 --> 08:37.600
NOW IF THE DEBT CEILING IS NOT

08:37.600 --> 08:37.733
RAISED

08:37.733 --> 08:40.933
HOUSE SPEAKER, JOHN BOEHNER,

08:40.933 --> 08:44.200
INSISTED THAT THE PRESIDEN

08:44.200 --> 08:46.067
NEGOTIATE IMMEDIATELY.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.467
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO PASS IT

08:48.467 --> 08:51.100
WHEN THE VOTES ARE NOT IN TH

08:51.100 --> 08:54.300
HOUSE TO PASS A CLEAN DEBT

08:54.300 --> 08:54.433
LIMIT.

08:54.433 --> 08:58.567
AND HE IS RISKING DEFAULT BY NOT

08:58.567 --> 09:00.167
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH US.

09:00.167 --> 09:04.467
>> THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID HE

09:04.467 --> 09:10.133
WILL OPEN CONVERSATIONS BUT ONLY

09:10.133 --> 09:14.233
AFTER THE SHUTDOWN IS LIFTED

09:14.233 --> 09:16.400
>> THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE

09:16.400 --> 09:18.667
THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION I

09:18.667 --> 09:21.400
THAT KIND OF A WAY

09:21.400 --> 09:23.233
HE HAS CONSULTED WITH HI

09:23.233 --> 09:26.000
LAWYERS AND THAT IS TH

09:26.000 --> 09:37.267
CONCLUSION THAT HE HAS REACHED

09:37.267 --> 09:42.167
OF COURSE THE SO-CALLED WAR ON

09:42.167 --> 09:44.933
TERROR BEGAN IN AFGHANISTA

09:44.933 --> 09:48.467
WEEKS AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11th

09:48.467 --> 09:49.500
ATTACKS.

09:49.500 --> 09:53.200
TROOPS ARE STILL DEPLOYED IN

09:53.200 --> 09:55.333
THAT COUNTRY AND FOUR OF THE

09:55.333 --> 09:58.000
WERE KILLED TODAY IN A BOMBING

09:58.000 --> 09:59.233
IN THE SOUTH

09:59.233 --> 10:02.167
>> FOR THE LATEST ABOUT ALL OF

10:02.167 --> 10:08.400
THIS WE ARE JOINED BY MATTHE

10:08.400 --> 10:10.100
RESENBERG FROM KABUL

10:10.100 --> 10:12.933
WHERE ARE WE IN THE PLANS FO

10:12.933 --> 10:14.200
TROOP WITHDRAWAL

10:14.200 --> 10:16.900
>> THE PLAN IS A SMALL RESIDUA

10:16.900 --> 10:19.633
FORCE UP TO 9,000 PEOPLE TO HELP

10:19.633 --> 10:22.567
TRAIN THE AFGHANS WITH A SMALLER

10:22.567 --> 10:24.333
COUNTER TERRORISM FORCE.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.167
GUYS WHO WOULD GO OUT AN

10:26.167 --> 10:28.100
CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST A

10:28.100 --> 10:30.433
QAEDA HERE

10:30.433 --> 10:34.200
THE THING IS THAT IS CONTINGEN

10:34.200 --> 10:38.333
ON THE AFGHANS AND THE

10:38.333 --> 10:38.900
AMERICANS.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.467
AFTER 2014 WHEN THEIR LEGA

10:41.467 --> 10:43.267
MANDATE ENDS AND EVERYBODY SAI

10:43.267 --> 10:45.600
WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT DON

10:45.600 --> 10:48.567
BUT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, TH

10:48.567 --> 10:52.000
IMPASSE HAS GOTTEN LONGER AN

10:52.000 --> 10:53.433
LONGER AND WITHIN THE WHIT

10:53.433 --> 11:00.167
HOUSE, YOU CAN TELL A GROWIN

11:00.167 --> 11:02.567
CONTINGENCY, LET'S JUST LEAVE WE

11:02.567 --> 11:05.067
DON'T NEED TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

11:05.067 --> 11:06.433
WHY ARE WE TRY SNG

11:06.433 --> 11:08.567
>> WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS THA

11:08.567 --> 11:11.133
LEADERS HAVE ABOUT REDUCING OU

11:11.133 --> 11:15.667
TROOP LEVELS TO ZERO

11:15.667 --> 11:18.667
>> THE AMERICANS HAVE SAID I

11:18.667 --> 11:21.500
THE MILITARY LEAVES THE AID THAT

11:21.500 --> 11:23.767
THEY DEPEND ON, THEY ARE NOT

11:23.767 --> 11:25.900
GOING TO GET THE MONEY

11:25.900 --> 11:27.500
AFGHANISTAN IS NOT A COUNTRY

11:27.500 --> 11:32.267
THAT CAN SUPPORT ITSELF.

11:32.267 --> 11:36.500
THE SECURITY FORCES, HOW THE

11:36.500 --> 11:37.800
GOVERNMENT RUNS.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.067
THE AFGHAN ARMY DOES NOT HAV

11:41.067 --> 11:42.067
AIR SUPPORT.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.267
IT NEEDS HELP.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.967
AND IF WE LEAVE, IT WON'T GE

11:45.967 --> 11:46.467
THAT HELP.

11:46.467 --> 11:50.467
>> PERHAPS THIS IS A QUESTION OF

11:50.467 --> 11:50.733
LOGISTICS.

11:50.733 --> 11:55.000
BUT HOW SOON IS THIS GOING TO BE

11:55.000 --> 11:55.267
MADE

11:55.267 --> 11:57.267
>> NOT AS SOON AS YOU THINK.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.967
THE WITHDRAWAL PLAN HAS TH

11:59.967 --> 12:03.467
NUMBERS DOWN BY FEBRUARY

12:03.467 --> 12:06.600
YOU CAN GET ROUGHLY 10,000

12:06.600 --> 12:08.167
TROOPS OUT A MONTH

12:08.167 --> 12:10.133
I THINK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

12:10.133 --> 12:12.333
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A REPEAT

12:12.333 --> 12:17.100
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ

12:17.100 --> 12:19.400
IT LOOKS BAD AT HOME AND THE

12:19.400 --> 12:26.100
HAVE TO PULL 8,000 OR 9,00

12:26.100 --> 12:26.767
PEOPLE OUT

12:26.767 --> 12:30.567
>> SO, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN RELEASE

12:30.567 --> 12:34.833
OF HIGH PROFILE TALIBAN LEADER

12:34.833 --> 12:36.100
FROM PAKISTAN.

12:36.100 --> 12:41.133
WHERE ARE WE IN NEGOTIATING WITH

12:41.133 --> 12:42.367

IT WAS NOT EVEN A COURSE AND I

17:37.567 --> 17:40.267
REMEMBER SITTING IN THE CLAS

17:40.267 --> 17:43.800
THINKING THAT A STUDENT LIKE A

THAT THEY WILL GET JOBS IN THA
