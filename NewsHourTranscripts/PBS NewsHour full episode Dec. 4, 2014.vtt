TIMES, TWICE IN THE HEAD.       
AND WHEN I WENT TO HIS          
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   

51:16.592 --> 51:18.925
AND WHEN I WENT TO HIS          
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND  

51:18.927 --> 51:20.595
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND  
SAY THINGS LIKE "WOULD YOU LIKE

SAY THINGS LIKE "WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY TODDLER 
WITH HIS HANDS UP IN THE AIR?"  

51:26.938 --> 51:28.238
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY TODDLER 
WITH HIS HANDS UP IN THE AIR?"  
AND ONE YOUNG MAN SAID TO ME "I 

51:28.240 --> 51:29.040
WITH HIS HANDS UP IN THE AIR?"  
AND ONE YOUNG MAN SAID TO ME "I 
LOOK JUST LIKE HIM.

LOOK JUST LIKE HIM.             
THAT COULD BE ME."              
AND BOTH THINGS DISTURBED ME,   

51:40.156 --> 51:41.455
THAT COULD BE ME."              
AND BOTH THINGS DISTURBED ME,   
THE SENSE OF BLACK BODIES INSIDE

51:41.457 --> 51:45.061

THE SENSE OF BLACK BODIES INSIDE
A DEAD BODY.                    

51:45.063 --> 51:50.434

ONLY THING I'VE DONE SO FAR IS  
WRITTEN A SMALL HAIKU.          

51:56.510 --> 51:58.945
ONLY THING I'VE DONE SO FAR IS  
WRITTEN A SMALL HAIKU.          
IT GOES BECAUSE WHITE MEN CAN'T 

51:58.947 --> 52:00.113
WRITTEN A SMALL HAIKU.          
IT GOES BECAUSE WHITE MEN CAN'T 
POLICE THEIR IMAGINATION BLACK  

52:00.115 --> 52:04.051
IT GOES BECAUSE WHITE MEN CAN'T 
POLICE THEIR IMAGINATION BLACK  
MEN ARE DYING.
