WOODRUFF: President Trump faced
dramatically different crowds
as he made his way across

00:04.533 --> 00:06.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Europe today.

00:06.566 --> 00:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His second overseas trip began
in Poland, before he moved
on to Hamburg, Germany, the

00:12.566 --> 00:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
site of the summit of
leaders of the major
industrialized nations.

RYAN CHILCOTE, PBS NEWSHOUR
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over): President
Trump kicked off his

00:23.300 --> 00:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second trip to Europe by doing
something he was criticized
for not doing on his first:

00:29.466 --> 00:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offering America's full
commitment to the NATO alliance.

00:31.566 --> 00:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The United States has
demonstrated not merely with
words but with its actions

00:37.766 --> 00:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we stand firmly
behind Article 5, the
mutual defense commitment.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Words are easy but
actions are what matters.

00:48.466 --> 00:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Mr. Trump was
addressing a friendly
crowd of some 15,000
in Warsaw, Poland, some

00:55.600 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the spectators bused
in by the country's
center-right governing party.

01:00.133 --> 01:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To the delight of Poles
concerned about Russia,
their neighbor to the
east, he declared the

01:04.733 --> 01:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
West would triumph over
its many adversaries.

01:07.866 --> 01:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The fundamental question
of our time is whether the
West has the will to survive.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I declare today for the
world to hear that the West
will never, ever be broken.

01:22.533 --> 01:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our values will prevail, our
people will thrive, and our
civilization will triumph.

01:30.533 --> 01:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: The president, though,
reiterated criticism of some
NATO allies in Western Europe

01:36.666 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for not committing more
to defense spending.

01:39.266 --> 01:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also offered his
most forceful condemnation
yet of Russia, just a
day before his meeting

01:44.566 --> 01:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with President Vladimir Putin.

01:46.666 --> 01:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: We urge Russia to cease
its destabilizing activities in
Ukraine and elsewhere and its

01:53.833 --> 01:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support for hostile regimes,
including Syria and Iran, and
to instead join the community

02:01.300 --> 02:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of responsible nations.

02:03.433 --> 02:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: Hours earlier, at a
press conference with Poland's
president, though, Mr. Trump

02:08.333 --> 02:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skirted questions about Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

02:12.066 --> 02:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REPORTER: Will you once and for
all, yes or no, definitively
say that Russia interfered

02:17.033 --> 02:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the 2016 election?

02:19.500 --> 02:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I think it
was Russia and I think
it could've been other
people and other countries.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could've been a lot
of people interfered.

02:25.966 --> 02:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody really knows, nobody
really knows for sure.

02:28.700 --> 02:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Mr. Trump also
cast blame on former
President Barack Obama.

02:32.466 --> 02:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think what happened is
that he thought Hillary Clinton
was going to win the election

02:36.233 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he said, let's not
do anything about it.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Had he thought the other
way, he would have done
something about it.

02:41.966 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: President Trump
then flew to Hamburg,
Germany for the G20 Summit.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There he met German
Chancellor Angela Merkel.

02:48.933 --> 02:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two have publicly tussled
on a variety of issues including
trade and climate change.

02:55.966 --> 03:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the while the "welcome to
hell" protest, its actual title,
was already under way, turning

03:01.666 --> 03:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violent almost immediately.

03:03.700 --> 03:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of protesters clashed
with police in riot gear who
used water cannons to disperse

03:09.000 --> 03:10.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crowds.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others rushed demonstrators,
tackling them to the ground.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

03:14.966 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: President Trump's
most important meeting
is, of course, tomorrow.

03:16.933 --> 03:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be his first
ever meeting with the
president of Russia -- Judy.

03:20.966 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, Ryan,
you've covered the Kremlin.

03:23.733 --> 03:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you think Mr. Putin is
going to react to what President
Trump had to say today about

03:29.900 --> 03:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia's interference
in last year's election?

03:31.866 --> 03:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: Well, look, I don't
think that President Putin
will like those remarks.

03:36.100 --> 03:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, I think in
a way he will appreciate that
they were made in Poland and

03:42.766 --> 03:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not here at the G20 Summit, not
alongside the Russian president.

03:49.733 --> 03:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, they're well
aware that President Trump
is optically challenged.

03:56.033 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be very difficult
for him to say something
pro-Russian at this point.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They feel that, at this point,
it would be very difficult
for him to really achieve much

04:07.933 --> 04:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to improving the
Russian-American relationship.

04:11.866 --> 04:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just don't want to
see it get any worse.

04:14.933 --> 04:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think they'll think
that he was sort of speaking
to the crowd, speaking to the

04:19.866 --> 04:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parlor, if you will, and what
really matters is what President
Trump tells them in that

04:26.933 --> 04:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
- - or tells President
Putin in that room when
it comes to policy, and
namely what President

04:33.533 --> 04:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin is hoping is two
things, that one, President
Trump will perhaps listen
to some of the issues

04:38.233 --> 04:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he has with the Ukrainian
side, when it comes to
Russia's conflict in Ukraine,

04:44.733 --> 04:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and secondly, President Putin
will be hoping that he can use
Russia's precedence in Syria,

04:49.766 --> 04:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Russia is doing in Syria
as a bridge to the United
States, find some kind of common

04:55.800 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground, encourage President
Trump to pursue for example
Islamic State in Syria together

05:00.600 --> 05:02.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Syria.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is a whole lot
of challenges but that
has always been the
Russians' big hope that

05:05.433 --> 05:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can team up with the United
States or at least the lower
the level, the temperature

05:09.933 --> 05:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the relationship by
working together in Syria.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Ryan Chilcote
