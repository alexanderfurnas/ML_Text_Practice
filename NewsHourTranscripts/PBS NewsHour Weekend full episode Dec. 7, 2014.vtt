00:48.348 --> 00:49.783
HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY THE

00:49.783 --> 00:51.018
SIX WERE NEVER CHARGED OR GIVEN

00:51.018 --> 00:51.985
A TRIAL DURING THEIR 12 YEARS OF

00:51.985 --> 00:53.687
DETENTION.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.155
THIS IS THE LARGEST PRISONER

00:55.155 --> 00:56.757
CONTINGENT TO LEAVE GITMO SINCE

00:56.757 --> 00:57.724
2009, AND IT'S THE FIRST GROUP

00:57.724 --> 00:58.625
OF DETAINEES SENT TO SOUTH

AMERICA.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.095
THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN IN THE

01:02.095 --> 01:02.896
WORKS SINCE JANUARY, BUT

01:02.896 --> 01:03.864
URUGUAY'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

01:03.864 --> 01:05.632
DELAYED THE DEAL.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.833
THE STATE DEPARTMENT EXPRESSED

01:06.833 --> 01:08.201
ITS GRATITUDE AND CALLED THE

01:08.201 --> 01:09.569
TRANSFER A "MILESTONE IN U.S.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.304

REFUGEES AND THE FIRST DAY THAT

01:18.612 --> 01:19.713
THEY WANT TO LEAVE, THEY CAN

01:19.713 --> 01:21.214
LEAVE."

01:21.214 --> 01:23.650
136 DETAINEES REMAIN AT THE

01:23.650 --> 01:25.085
PRISON, INCLUDING 67 WHO'VE BEEN

01:25.085 --> 01:30.223

01:30.223 --> 01:31.625
IN SAUDI ARABIA, 135 PEOPLE

01:31.625 --> 01:37.831
SUSPECTED OF PLOTTING TERRORIST

01:37.831 --> 01:38.665
INSIDE THE KINGDOM HAVE BEEN

01:38.665 --> 01:39.533
ARRESTED.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.367
MOST OF THEM ARE SAUDI

01:40.367 --> 01:41.401
NATIONALS.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.169
SAUDI ARABIA IS STEPPING UP

01:42.169 --> 01:43.003
SECURITY AFTER GETTING THREATS

01:43.003 --> 01:43.770
FROM ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS IN

01:43.770 --> 01:44.604
RECENT WEEKS.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.539
IN MEXICO, AT LEAST ONE OF THE

01:45.539 --> 01:46.506
43 STUDENTS MISSING SINCE

01:46.506 --> 01:47.441
SEPTEMBER HAS NOW BEEN

01:47.441 --> 01:48.408
IDENTIFIED.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.443
FAMILY MEMBERS SAY THE REMAINS

01:49.443 --> 01:50.577
HAD BEEN MOSTLY BURNED TO ASHES.

01:50.577 --> 01:51.645
THE DISCOVERY ADDS WEIGHT TO THE

01:51.645 --> 01:52.612
PROSECUTOR'S THEORY THAT THE

01:52.612 --> 01:53.714
STUDENTS WERE KILLED AFTER BEING

01:53.714 --> 01:55.048
ABDUCTED BY LOCAL POLICE AND

01:55.048 --> 01:56.416
TURNED OVER TO A DRUG GANG.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.184
THE STUDENTS DISAPPEARANCE

01:57.184 --> 01:57.918
TOUCHED OFF MASSIVE PROTESTS IN

01:57.918 --> 02:01.088
MEXICO CITY LAST MONTH.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.155
TODAY THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE

02:02.155 --> 02:03.123
STUDENTS SAYS THE PROTESTS WILL

02:03.123 --> 02:05.592
GO ON.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.594
>> (translated): AS OF TODAY,

02:07.594 --> 02:09.262
OUR DAYS OF FIGHTING WILL

02:09.262 --> 02:10.564
CONTINUE UNTIL WE FIND THE OTHER

02:10.564 --> 02:13.266
MISSING FORTY TWO FRIENDS ALIVE.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.267
>> Sreenivasan: MEXICAN

02:14.267 --> 02:15.502
AUTHORITIES ARE HOLDING MORE

02:15.502 --> 02:16.770
THAN 70 PEOPLE IN CUSTODY,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.639
INCLUDING THE MAYOR, POLICE

02:19.639 --> 02:20.607
OFFICERS, AND GANG MEMBERS FROM

02:20.607 --> 02:21.708
THE TOWN WHERE THE STUDENTS WERE

02:21.708 --> 02:22.976
ABDUCTED.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.311
HERE IN THE U.S., PROTESTS OVER

02:24.311 --> 02:25.846
RECENT POLICE KILLINGS TURNED

02:25.846 --> 02:26.613
VIOLENT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:26.613 --> 02:27.714
LAST NIGHT.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.282
AT LEAST 300 PEOPLE MARCHED IN

02:29.282 --> 02:30.117
MOSTLY PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS

02:30.117 --> 02:31.518
NEAR THE BERKELEY CAMPUS.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.153
BUT AUTHORITIES SAY A SPLINTER

02:33.153 --> 02:34.221
GROUP OF PROTESTERS SMASHED

02:34.221 --> 02:35.288
WINDOWS AND THREW BRICKS,

02:35.288 --> 02:36.990
WRENCHES, SMOKE GRENADES AND

02:36.990 --> 02:40.293
EVEN SANDBAGS AT POLICE.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.061
OFFICERS FIRED BACK WITH TEAR

02:41.061 --> 02:43.697
GAS.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.232
TWO POLICE OFFICERS WERE HURT

02:45.232 --> 02:45.966
AND SEVERAL BUSINESSES WERE

02:45.966 --> 02:48.035
VANDALIZED.

02:48.035 --> 02:48.869
ANOTHER ROUND OF PROTESTS IS

02:48.869 --> 02:49.870
EXPECTED TONIGHT IN NEW YORK,

02:49.870 --> 02:50.670
CHICAGO, MINNEAPOLIS, MIAMI AND

02:50.670 --> 02:53.640
PHILADELPHIA.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.242
IN LOUISIANA, DEMOCRAT MARY

02:55.242 --> 02:56.743
LANDRIEU LOST YESTERDAY'S RUNOFF

02:56.743 --> 02:58.045
ELECTION TO BILL CASSIDY BY A

02:58.045 --> 02:59.579
LARGE MARGIN, BOLSTERING THE

02:59.579 --> 03:03.650
REPUBLICAN'S CONTROL OF THE

03:03.650 --> 03:04.818
SENATE.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.353
CASSIDY PROMISED TO SEEK THE

03:06.353 --> 03:07.621
REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

03:07.621 --> 03:08.855
ACT THROUGHOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.057
WITH CASSIDY'S VICTORY, THE

03:10.057 --> 03:11.091
REPUBLICANS HAVE GAINED A TOTAL

03:11.091 --> 03:12.325
OF NINE SENATE SEATS, GIVING

03:12.325 --> 03:13.560
THEM 54 SENATORS AND FIRM

03:13.560 --> 03:14.661
CONTROL GOING INTO THE NEW

03:14.661 --> 03:16.029
SESSION OF CONGRESS.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.330
TWO MORE LOUISIANA REPUBLICANS

03:17.330 --> 03:18.398
WON THEIR RUNOFF ELECTIONS FOR

03:18.398 --> 03:19.466
U.S. HOUSE SEATS.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.600
LANDRIEU'S LOSS MEANS LOUISIANA

03:20.600 --> 03:21.635
WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED BY A

03:21.635 --> 03:22.736
DEMOCRAT IN THE U.S. SENATE FOR

03:22.736 --> 03:25.539
THE FIRST TIME IN 131 YEARS.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.374
AND THE U.S. BIRTH RATE HAS

03:27.374 --> 03:28.842
REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW, AS

03:28.842 --> 03:30.177
WOMEN WAIT LONGER TO HAVE

03:30.177 --> 03:31.812
CHILDREN.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.879
THIS, ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS

03:32.879 --> 03:34.047
FOR DISEASE CONTROL.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.315
BIRTH RATES FOR WOMEN OVER 35

03:35.315 --> 03:37.017
REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN

03:37.017 --> 03:38.351
ABOUT 50 YEARS.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.953
BIRTH RATES FOR WOMEN BETWEEN

03:39.953 --> 03:41.421
THE AGES OF 15 AND 44 HAVE

03:41.421 --> 03:45.058
DROPPED 10% SINCE 2007.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.294
THE SHARPEST DROP OCCURRED AMONG

03:47.294 --> 03:49.029
TEENS WHOSE BIRTH RATES FELL

03:49.029 --> 04:00.373
10%, JUST IN THE LAST YEAR.

04:00.373 --> 04:01.908
>> Sreenivasan: WE'RE LEARNING

04:01.908 --> 04:03.543
MORE ABOUT THAT FAILED HOSTAGE

04:03.543 --> 04:04.578
RESCUE ATTEMPT IN SOUTHERN

04:04.578 --> 04:05.846
YEMEN.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.847
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES TRIED TO

04:06.847 --> 04:07.881
FREE PHOTOJOURNALIST LUKE SOMERS

04:07.881 --> 04:08.715
FROM AL-QAEDA MILITANTS

04:08.715 --> 04:10.183
YESTERDAY.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.219
BUT THE KIDNAPPERS FATALLY SHOT

04:12.219 --> 04:13.820
SOMERS AND ANOTHER HOSTAGE,

04:13.820 --> 04:15.255
SOUTH AFRICAN TEACHER PIERRE

04:15.255 --> 04:16.690
KORKIE, JUST BEFORE THE

04:16.690 --> 04:18.391
COMMANDOS COULD GET TO THEM.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.759
THE BBC REPORTS U.S. SPECIAL

04:19.759 --> 04:20.861
FORCES DIDN'T KNOW KORKIE WAS

04:20.861 --> 04:22.829
BEING HELD THERE.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.097
A CHARITY WORKING ON KORKIE'S

04:24.097 --> 04:25.465
RELEASE SAYS HE WAS SET TO BE

04:25.465 --> 04:26.800
FREED TODAY.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.401
I'M JOINED NOW BY REPORTER ADAM

04:28.401 --> 04:29.603
ENTOUS WHO CHRONICLED THE RAID

04:29.603 --> 04:32.906
FOR THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

04:32.906 --> 04:34.875
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS, DO

04:34.875 --> 04:35.876
WE KNOW ANY MORE INFORMATION

04:35.876 --> 04:37.077
ABOUT ANY OTHER CASUALTIES

04:37.077 --> 04:38.011
DURING THIS RAID?

04:38.011 --> 04:40.213
>> NO, THE LATEST WE HEARD

04:40.213 --> 04:41.681
IS THE AMERICANS ASSESSED

04:41.681 --> 04:45.986
THAT ABOUT 6 OR 7 AQAP OR AL

04:45.986 --> 04:47.120
QAEDA MILITANTS WERE KILLED

04:47.120 --> 04:48.788
IN THE RAID AND NONE OF THE

04:48.788 --> 04:49.823
SPECIAL FORCES THAT WERE

04:49.823 --> 04:51.158
INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.693
ABOUT 40 TOTAL, NONE OF THEM

04:53.693 --> 04:54.361
WERE HURT OR INJURED IN ANY

04:54.361 --> 04:54.995
WAY.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.097
BUT OF COURSE THE OUTCOME AS

04:57.097 --> 04:59.099
WE KNOW WAS NOT WHAT WAS

04:59.099 --> 05:00.100
INTENDED WITH THE DEATH OF

05:00.100 --> 05:01.868
THE TWO HOSTAGES.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.270
>> AND AT WHAT POINT DURING

05:03.270 --> 05:04.304
THIS OPERATION DID THING

05:04.304 --> 05:05.172
GOES SOUTH?

05:05.172 --> 05:08.675
>> WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT

05:08.675 --> 05:11.077
THE AMERICAN COMMANDO TEAM

05:11.077 --> 05:13.813
FLEW IN ON OSPREY AIRCRAFT

05:13.813 --> 05:17.217
TO A LANDING SPOT ABOUT 10

05:17.217 --> 05:18.318
KILOMETERS FROM THE COMPOUND

05:18.318 --> 05:19.653
WHERE THE HOSTAGES WERE

05:19.653 --> 05:20.587
BEING HELD.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.322
AND THEN THEY HIKED BY FOOT

05:22.322 --> 05:24.291
THROUGH THIS AREA TO ABOUT

05:24.291 --> 05:27.460
100 YARDS OF THE COMPOUND

05:27.460 --> 05:29.095
WHEN A NOISE WAS HEARD.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.630
ONE OFFICIAL TOLD ME THAT IT

05:30.630 --> 05:32.165
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DOG BARK,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.800
SOMETHING AS BENIGN AS THAT.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.402
AND THAT TIPPED OFF THE

05:35.402 --> 05:36.903
MILITANTS INSIDE WHO WERE

05:36.903 --> 05:39.072
ALREADY PRETTY TRIGGER HAPPY,

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073
SINCE THERE WAS A PREVIOUS

05:40.073 --> 05:41.274
RAID LATE LAST MONTH TO TRY

05:41.274 --> 05:43.310
TO FREE THE AMERICAN HOSTAGE.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.178
AND THEY OPENED FIRE.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.746
AND AT THAT POINT, YOU KNOW,

05:46.746 --> 05:48.448
THE COMMANDOS WERE STILL ON

05:48.448 --> 05:49.316
THE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPOUND.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.518
AND THAT'S WHEN AMERICANS

05:51.518 --> 05:52.886
BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE

05:52.886 --> 05:54.254
MILITANTS WENT INSIDE A

05:54.254 --> 05:55.956
BUILDING AND FIRED SHOTS

05:55.956 --> 05:57.724
KILLING THE TWO HOSTAGES.

05:57.724 --> 05:58.725
>> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT

05:58.725 --> 05:59.759
ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE THAT

05:59.759 --> 06:01.528
WENT INTO THIS OPERATION.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.862
OBVIOUSLY THE TIMETABLE WAS

06:02.862 --> 06:03.563
ACCELERATED WITH THE

06:03.563 --> 06:04.598
DEADLINE OF A POSSIBLE

06:04.598 --> 06:06.366
KILLING AM BUT EVEN IF THESE

06:06.366 --> 06:07.634
TWO GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING

06:07.634 --> 06:08.935
TOGETHER, WITH ALL THE

06:08.935 --> 06:09.769
INTELLIGENCE RESOURCES THAT

06:09.769 --> 06:11.204
THEY HAD, THEY STILL DIDN'T

06:11.204 --> 06:12.072
KNOW THAT THERE WAS THIS

06:12.072 --> 06:13.406
OTHER HOSTAGE THERE.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.341
>> WELL, THEY KNEW THAT

06:14.341 --> 06:15.542
THERE WAS ANOTHER HOSTAGE

06:15.542 --> 06:16.943
THERE, BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW

06:16.943 --> 06:18.745
WHO IT WAS.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.047
BASICALLY AFTER THE RAID

06:21.047 --> 06:22.749
AROUND THANKSGIVING, OR JUST

06:22.749 --> 06:25.385
BEFORE THANKSGIVING, THE

06:25.385 --> 06:29.022
U.S. SAW TWO HOSTAGES BEING

06:29.022 --> 06:30.957
MOVED FROM THE PREVIOUS SITE

06:30.957 --> 06:32.158
WHICH WAS A CAVE.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.460
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO THOSE

06:33.460 --> 06:35.829
PEOPLE WERE BUT IT SEEMS

06:35.829 --> 06:37.197
THEY INCORRECTLY THOUGHT AT

06:37.197 --> 06:38.565
THE TIME THAT IT DID NOT

06:38.565 --> 06:40.300
INCLUDE THE AMERICAN.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.370
THAT RAID IN NOVEMBER HELPED

06:43.370 --> 06:45.472
LEAD SPECIAL FORCES TO THIS

06:45.472 --> 06:47.540
NEW COMPOUND AND CLEARLY THE

06:47.540 --> 06:49.943
INTELLIGENCE WAS CORRECT IN

06:49.943 --> 06:52.979
THE SENSE THAT IT HAD THE

06:52.979 --> 06:53.880
AMERICAN MAN A SECOND

06:53.880 --> 06:54.547
HOSTAGE.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.482
ALTHOUGH THE AMERICANS

06:55.482 --> 06:56.483
DIDN'T KNOW WHO THAT SECOND

06:56.483 --> 06:57.150
HOSTAGE WAS.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.585
BUT GETTING INTELLIGENCE IN

06:58.585 --> 06:59.586
THIS PART OF THE WORLD IS

06:59.586 --> 07:00.787
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.222
AND AS YOU KNOW,

07:02.222 --> 07:04.391
INTELLIGENCE IS PERISHABLE.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.925
YOU KNOW, THE INFORMATION

07:05.925 --> 07:08.561
MIGHT BE RIGHT AT ONE POINT

07:08.561 --> 07:10.563
BUT AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF

07:10.563 --> 07:11.865
TIME, IF THE WEATHER ISN'T

07:11.865 --> 07:13.300
RIGHT AND THE DRONES CAN'T

07:13.300 --> 07:14.668
WATCH PEOPLE COMING AND

07:14.668 --> 07:16.369
GOING, THAT INTELLIGENCE CAN

07:16.369 --> 07:17.671
QUICKLY BE OUT OF DATE.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.372
>> SO WHAT DOES THIS DO TO

07:19.372 --> 07:21.408
FUTURE MISSIONS OR-- I MEAN

07:21.408 --> 07:22.809
YOU SAID IN YOUR REPORTING

07:22.809 --> 07:24.177
THAT SOME OF THE U.S.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.745
OFFICIALS YOU SPOKE TO WERE

07:25.745 --> 07:27.247
DEVASTATED BY THIS FAILURE.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.615
>> YES, THIS WAS THE SECOND

07:28.615 --> 07:30.650
VERY RISKY RAID THAT THE

07:30.650 --> 07:31.985
U.S. HAS DONE TO TRY TO GET

07:31.985 --> 07:33.019
THIS AMERICAN HOSTAGE IN

07:33.019 --> 07:34.387
YEMEN.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.655
AND AT THE WHITE HOUSE, I

07:35.655 --> 07:36.690
KNOW FROM TALKING TO

07:36.690 --> 07:38.058
OFFICIALS, THEY WERE REALLY

07:38.058 --> 07:39.259
HEARTBROKEN THAT IT WAS NOT

07:39.259 --> 07:40.160
SUCCESSFUL.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.128
THEY REALLY DID TAKE A HUGE

07:42.128 --> 07:44.564
RISK HERE.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.266
THEY WERE INSERTING 40

07:46.266 --> 07:48.968
SPECIAL FORCES TO RESCUE ONE

07:48.968 --> 07:49.669
AMERICAN.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.372
IN A PART OF YEMEN WHERE A

07:52.372 --> 07:53.973
LOT OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG

07:53.973 --> 07:55.442
WITH SUICIDE BOMBERS AND

07:55.442 --> 07:56.309
THINGS LIKE THAT.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.347
SO YOU KNOW, IT WAS A REALLY-- A

08:00.347 --> 08:01.381
REAL BIG GAMBLE.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.749
BUT FROM THERE PERSPECTIVE,

08:02.749 --> 08:04.084
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST

08:04.084 --> 08:07.220
SHOT THAT SUMMERS HAD

08:07.220 --> 08:08.221
BECAUSE THEY WERE

08:08.221 --> 08:09.422
THREATENING TO EXECUTE HIM

08:09.422 --> 08:11.624
AS EARLY AS LATER THAT SAME

08:11.624 --> 08:12.959
DAY THAT THE RAID WAS TAKING

08:12.959 --> 08:13.860
PLACE.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.462

08:37.817 --> 08:40.420
SMALL CONTRIBUTORS.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.021

08:42.021 --> 08:43.990
TO DEPRESSION-ERA LAWS THAT WERE

08:43.990 --> 08:45.592
DESIGNED TO PROTECT THOSE SMALL

08:45.592 --> 08:46.726
INVESTORS FROM BEING FLEECED.

08:46.726 --> 08:47.994
BUT AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS

08:47.994 --> 08:49.162
UPDATED SEGMENT, THE LAW ITSELF

08:49.162 --> 08:50.096
HASN'T QUITE GOTTEN OFF THE

14:56.662 --> 14:57.563
REMEMBER, SINCE WE STARTED AOL

14:57.563 --> 14:58.464
ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO WHEN THE

14:58.464 --> 14:59.232
INTERNET JUST BEGINNING TO BE AN

14:59.232 --> 14:59.999

WHEN PEOPLE ENTERING

15:11.944 --> 15:12.812
COMFORTABLE THAT THEY WERE GOING

15:12.812 --> 15:13.479
TO BE PROTECTED.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.480
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THESE

15:14.480 --> 15:15.615

DOES THE EVIDENCE POINT TO NORTH

18:14.060 --> 18:16.495
>> WELL, THAT AT LEAST NO

18:16.495 --> 18:17.763
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT

18:17.763 --> 18:19.598
NORTH KOREA WAS BEHIND THE

18:19.598 --> 18:21.534
ATTACKS ON SONY PICTURES.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.269
WHAT WE DO KNOW ARE THAT

18:23.269 --> 18:29.008
THERE ARE-- THERE ARE SOME

18:29.008 --> 18:30.509
ATTACKS TO AN EARLIER ONE

18:30.509 --> 18:31.677
SINCE ABOUT 2009 THERE HAVE

18:31.677 --> 18:33.112
BEEN COUNTLESS ATTACKS ON

18:33.112 --> 18:36.882
SOUTH KOREA BY A GANG WHICH

18:36.882 --> 18:39.585
SECURITY RESEARCHERS HAVE

18:39.585 --> 18:41.187
NICK NAMED THE DARK SEOUL

18:41.187 --> 18:43.589
GANG WHICH WAS THE NAME FOR

18:43.589 --> 18:47.059
THE MALWARE THAT THEY WERE

18:47.059 --> 18:48.794
USING AT THE TIME.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.829
THEY FOUND THAT THESE

18:49.829 --> 18:52.465
HACKERS WERE ON THE SURFACE

18:52.465 --> 18:56.635
LOOKED LIKE HACKTIVISTS.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.970
THEY WERE DEFACING WEB

18:57.970 --> 18:58.571
SITES.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.705
THE CODE THEY HAD WRITTEN

18:59.705 --> 19:01.307
WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO

19:01.307 --> 19:02.875
STEAL SOUTH KOREAN AND

ARE MANY HERE IN SOUTH

19:08.848 --> 19:10.783

19:10.783 --> 19:12.752
SO THERE WHILE THERE IS

19:12.752 --> 19:13.853
STILL NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE

19:13.853 --> 19:15.821
THAT NORTH KOREA IS INDEED
