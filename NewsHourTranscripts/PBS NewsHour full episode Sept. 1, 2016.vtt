I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.474 --> 00:08.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:10.244 --> 00:13.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
In a Trump administration, all
immigration

00:13.480 --> 00:15.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
laws will be enforced.

00:15.415 --> 00:20.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump
outlines tough immigration
proposals hours after returning
from a surprise

00:20.821 --> 00:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meeting with Mexico's president.

00:22.823 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
a deep dive into the politics of
trade this

00:26.360 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential election, and where
Hillary Clinton
stands on America role's in the
global economy.

00:31.398 --> 00:37.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And empty shelves
line Venezuela's
grocery stores, as desperate
crowds await

00:37.037 --> 00:40.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare meal -- a look at the
country's worsening
food shortage.

00:40.807 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
one article
of food per person, and then you
have to wait

00:44.745 --> 00:48.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eight days, because, if you try
to buy more,
they will stop you.

00:48.048 --> 00:54.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.454 --> 00:56.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.790 --> 01:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The campaign
spotlight stayed
on Donald Trump today, and what
he will or

01:07.768 --> 01:11.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not do about immigration,
deportation,
and a border wall.

01:11.805 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican nominee faced
fallout from
a fiery speech last night hours
after he had

01:16.276 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken a more moderate tone with
Mexico's president.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a full report after
the news
summary.

01:21.949 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: People
along Florida's Gulf Coast
braced for a direct

01:26.687 --> 01:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hit tonight by a hurricane, the
state's first
since 2005.

01:31.024 --> 01:37.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hermine is projected to make
landfall with
winds of 75 miles an hour or
higher and drive

01:37.230 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the state toward the
Atlantic.

01:39.599 --> 01:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As it approached today, rain
caused minor
flooding, and people filled
sandbags.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Rick Scott warned
against taking
the storm for granted.

GOV.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: We're
going to see
a big storm surge.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to see a lot of
rain.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to see flooding.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to see downed power
lines.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to see -- there's
going to be
a lot of risk if we don't do our
job.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody needs to be prepared.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are blessed.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the best emergency
management teams
in the country at the state and
at the local

02:03.056 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
level.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a great National Guard,
but you have
got to take this seriously.

02:06.426 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Many cities in the
storm's path,
including the capital,
Tallahassee, have not

02:11.331 --> 02:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been hit by a hurricane in
decades.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: State
lawmakers in California
are expanding a climate change
law that's

02:17.771 --> 02:20.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
already the most aggressive in
the nation.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Majority Democrats agreed last
night to regulate
methane emissions from landfills
and dairy

02:24.911 --> 02:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
farms for the first time.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came over the objections of
industry and
farming interests.

02:29.683 --> 02:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A huge explosion
rocked a SpaceX
launch pad today at Cape
Canaveral, Florida.

02:35.088 --> 02:40.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unmanned Falcon rocket blew
up as a test
for a Saturday launch was under
way.

02:40.527 --> 02:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The blast also destroyed a
communications
satellite on board, but no one
was hurt.

02:45.465 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SpaceX said there was a problem
in a fuel
tank, but they gave no details.

02:49.302 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Eastern
Ukraine, a fragile
new cease-fire took effect at
midnight between

02:53.974 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government troops and
pro-Russian rebels.

02:56.043 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both President Petro Poroshenko
and the rebels
said the truce appeared to be
holding.

03:00.714 --> 03:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting had flared in the
contested Donetsk
region over the last month after
an earlier

03:04.785 --> 03:06.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cease-fire collapsed.

03:06.486 --> 03:11.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, authorities
in Florida have found Zika virus
in three

03:11.458 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups of mosquitoes in Miami
Beach.

03:14.327 --> 03:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first time that's
happened in the
continental United States.

03:17.731 --> 03:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The insects were trapped in the
small area
that's seen active Zika
transmission.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials said today the finding
will help
them fight the virus.

DR.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BRADEN, Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention: If there are
positive traps,

03:28.141 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we know when, we know where.

03:29.509 --> 03:30.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

03:30.677 --> 03:33.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can identify where this
transmission is
occurring.

03:33.113 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Typically, what happens is that
transmission
occurs in mosquitoes in a
limited area.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we can intensify what we
do in those
areas.

03:41.721 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We can do more active
surveillance, we can
do surveys, we can do more
active mosquito

03:46.293 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The control efforts
could be complicated
by the hurricane coming ashore
tonight.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its heavy rain will leave new
breeding pools
for mosquitoes.

03:54.734 --> 03:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In economic
news: Major
automakers reported U.S. sales
slumped in

03:59.039 --> 04:03.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
August, as a surge in business
begins to cool
after six years.

04:03.076 --> 04:07.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 18 points to
close at 18419.

04:07.914 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 14
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added a fraction.

04:12.586 --> 04:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's
immigration speech in context;
both presidential

04:17.491 --> 04:22.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates make their appeals to
veterans;
where Clinton stands on
international trade;

04:22.529 --> 04:25.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

04:25.765 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The talk on the
campaign trail
today focused largely on one
issue, immigration,

04:39.179 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the new words from one
candidate, Donald
Trump.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUDIENCE: Build the wallo~!

04:45.352 --> 04:46.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Build the wallo~!

04:46.620 --> 04:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The scene today
was Southwestern
Ohio.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Don't worry, we're going to
build that wall.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That wall will go up.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But the big
applause lines
for Donald Trump were the same
as last night

04:58.165 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Phoenix: talk of a Mexican
border wall
and fighting illegal
immigration.

05:03.537 --> 05:07.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That speech was Trump's most
comprehensive
yet on his signature issue.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you
about my plan.

05:09.543 --> 05:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Tell, he did,
for an hour
and 15 minutes.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Much was familiar, but on the
topic of deportation,
something new.

05:17.284 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I am going to
create a new special
deportation task force focused
on identifying

05:25.659 --> 05:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and removing quickly the most
dangerous criminal
illegal immigrants in America.

05:31.364 --> 05:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's an
important shift,
as, in this speech in Florida
last year, previously,

05:37.204 --> 05:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump pledged to deport every
undocumented
immigrant.

05:40.006 --> 05:44.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
take people that
are here illegally, and we're
going to move

05:44.544 --> 05:45.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them out.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Got to move them out.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But last night,
the Republican
nominee said he would target
only some, those

05:51.484 --> 05:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who commit crimes and those who
overstay their
visa.

05:54.354 --> 05:59.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There are at least
two million
-- two million, think of it --
criminal aliens

05:59.359 --> 06:02.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now inside the country.

06:02.162 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will begin moving them out
day one.

06:06.399 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This leaves the
question
of what happens to everyone
else, millions

06:11.137 --> 06:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of others here illegally who
haven't committed
crimes since arriving.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump answered the question two
ways.

06:17.510 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, he said, those who stay
will remain
Outside the Law.

06:21.748 --> 06:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: For those here
today illegally
who are seeking legal status,
they will have

06:28.054 --> 06:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one route and only one route: to
return home
and apply for reentry, like
everybody else.

06:37.330 --> 06:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But later, near
the end of
the speech, Trump indicated that
someday that

06:42.569 --> 06:44.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could change.

06:44.504 --> 06:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: In several years,
when we have
accomplished all of our
enforcement and deportation

06:51.011 --> 06:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goals and truly ended illegal
immigration
for good, including the
construction of a

06:59.419 --> 07:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great wall, then and only then
will we be
in a position to consider the
appropriate

07:07.661 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disposition of those individuals
who remain.

07:12.465 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That discussion can take place
only in an
atmosphere in which illegal
immigration is

07:19.906 --> 07:21.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a memory of the past.

07:21.675 --> 07:27.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump also
launched a plan
to limit all legal immigration,
proposing

07:27.113 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a commission with these goals.

07:29.015 --> 07:34.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: To keep
immigration levels,
measured by population share,
within historical

07:34.821 --> 07:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
norms, to choose immigrants
based on merit,
merit, skill, and proficiency.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Doesn't that sound nice?

07:50.637 --> 07:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to establish new immigration
controls
to boost wages and to ensure
that open jobs

07:57.344 --> 08:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are offered to American workers
first.

08:00.380 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The speech
brought repeated
thunderous applause in the
arena, but in the

08:05.385 --> 08:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aftermath, multiple members of
Trump's Hispanic

Today, Democratic vice
presidential nominee
Tim Kaine slammed the speech as
anti-immigrant.

SEN.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
It is a deportation nation, and
they're all

08:19.599 --> 08:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criminals, and they're doing
terrible things.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not going to make our
country great.

08:23.703 --> 08:28.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Kaine also
charged that Trump
choked in yesterday's meeting
with Mexican

08:28.241 --> 08:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Pena Nieto by not
repeating his
demand that Mexico pay for a
border wall.

GWEN IFILL: Digging deeper into
the politics
and policy of the immigration
debate, we turn

08:41.187 --> 08:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Kris Kobach, the Kansas
secretary of state
who helped author Donald Trump's
immigration

08:46.693 --> 08:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, Marielena Hincapie, the
executive
director of the National
Immigration Law Center,

08:52.298 --> 08:56.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Karthick Ramakrishnan,
associate dean
of the School of Public Policy
at the University

08:57.003 --> 08:58.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of California, Riverside.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He writes extensively on
immigration issues.

09:01.508 --> 09:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Ramakrishnan, how did
immigration
end up being or at least appear
to be so central

09:06.246 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this political debate right
now?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN,
University of California,
Riverside: Well, it all started
with the launch

09:10.350 --> 09:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump's campaign.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a signature issue.

09:14.187 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the thing that got him a
lot of attention,
some would say a lot of negative
attention

09:18.658 --> 09:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the beginning, but he used
that publicity
and that notoriety to jump to
the top of the

09:24.030 --> 09:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican heap, and he has
never looked back
since.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marielena Hincapie,
how do you
interpret Donald Trump's
approach?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE, Executive
Director, National
Immigration Law Center: I think
Donald Trump

09:32.972 --> 09:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a very smart man who knows
how to use the
media, and he's using
immigration as a wedge

09:37.644 --> 09:39.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

09:39.479 --> 09:44.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He understands that there are
low-wage white
voters, for example, who are
feeling a lot

09:44.584 --> 09:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of economic distress and a lot
of economic
pain.

09:47.454 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And rather than focusing on the
true issues,
which is that those workers
deserve a living

09:51.558 --> 09:57.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage, collective bargaining,
safety net programs,
he instead is using their fear
of the other,

09:57.063 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their fear of immigrants and
scapegoating
immigrants and fear-mongering in
order to

10:01.468 --> 10:02.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get elected.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kris Kobach, she
said a lot of
things there.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to start about the part
about who he
is speaking to.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who is his audience?

10:10.176 --> 10:11.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
You know, I think he's speaking
to the American

10:11.778 --> 10:13.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people generally.

10:13.613 --> 10:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's talking -- in his speech
last night,
he's talking about putting
American interests

10:18.184 --> 10:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first, putting Americans first,
whether we
talk about the resources of our
country or

10:22.522 --> 10:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether we're talking about
crime.

10:24.257 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to the point that was just
made about
speaking to individuals who are
competing

10:30.330 --> 10:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with illegal labor for those
jobs and are
seeing wage depression in their
workplace,

10:36.836 --> 10:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illegal immigration, the impact
of it falls
disproportionately upon
African-American U.S.

10:41.908 --> 10:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens and Hispanic U.S.
citizens and legal
immigrants of Hispanic
ethnicity.

10:47.380 --> 10:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, really, he's
talking to -- in
terms of the wage depression
effect of illegal

10:52.652 --> 10:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration, he's talking to
individuals who
are often not white, and I think
this is part

10:57.557 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of actually broadening the base,
and making
that point that you know your
wages have suffered

11:01.494 --> 11:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of illegal immigration,
and I want
to do something about it.

11:04.297 --> 11:08.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Professor
Ramakrishnan, how often
is an immigration debate about
economics and

11:08.334 --> 11:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how much is it, as Marielena
Hincapie was
saying, is about fear-mongering?

11:12.472 --> 11:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Well,
there's a little
of both.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.843 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

11:16.876 --> 11:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, it's important to
correct the
record that Kris Kobach just
laid out.

11:20.346 --> 11:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Academy of Sciences
in a consensus
report among social sciences --
it's very

11:25.151 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult to get a consensus
among social
scientists -- found no evidence
-- this was

11:31.324 --> 11:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in a report 20 years ago
and also a more
recent report from last year --
no evidence

11:36.996 --> 11:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is any significant
wage depression
effect.

11:41.601 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More generally, when we talk
about America
being strong, it's important to
remember that

11:46.506 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
immigrants are Americans, too.

11:48.308 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, when you have seen
instances
like Riverside, New Jersey, for
example, which

11:53.746 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed a law trying to cut down
on undocumented
immigrants in the city, they
actually lost

12:00.320 --> 12:02.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
economically.

12:02.088 --> 12:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have cities and states
throughout the
country that are trying to get
immigrants,

12:05.458 --> 12:10.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
including low-skilled
immigrants, because
they are so vital to sectors
like construction

12:10.964 --> 12:12.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and agriculture.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm going to let
Kris Kobach respond
to that, and then I will get to
you, Marielena

12:15.668 --> 12:17.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hincapie, in a moment.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: The wage depression
effect has
been well-researched by
economists who have

12:20.540 --> 12:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looked specifically at it.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would note George Borjas
of Harvard
University has talked about it.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, look, it's just
commonsense.

12:26.346 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone who is familiar with the
industries
of, like, meatpacking or hotel
janitorial

12:30.883 --> 12:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service knows that those wages
have gone down
not only in real terms, but in
absolute dollars,

12:36.222 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because of illegal immigration.

12:38.057 --> 12:42.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the point about the
economies of places
that crack down on illegal
immigration, look

12:42.662 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the states of Arizona and
Georgia, two
states that have cracked down on
illegal immigration

12:47.533 --> 12:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the state level and have
E-Verify requirements
in place.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their economies are booming.

12:53.239 --> 12:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, clearly, pushing illegal
labor out of
the labor market doesn't mean
that a state's

12:57.644 --> 12:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy collapses, and the same
is true for
the country.

12:59.912 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marielena Hincapie,
let's talk
about one of the specific
proposals in Donald

13:04.183 --> 13:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's speech last night where
he talked
about deportation.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immediate -- he seemed to
suggest he was talking
about eventual deportation,
perhaps self-deportation,

13:12.925 --> 13:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which sounded very much like
something we
heard from Mitt Romney four
years ago.

13:16.663 --> 13:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How different is his deportation
plan, assuming
there are 11 million
undocumented immigrants

13:23.369 --> 13:25.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country?

13:25.204 --> 13:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How similar is it to what is
already in place
and what other Republican
candidates in the

13:28.608 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
past have proposed?

13:30.443 --> 13:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: I think
there are a couple
of things to what Trump said
last night.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one is, he appeared to be --
at least
before the speech yesterday, he
appeared to

13:37.483 --> 13:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be trying to tone down the
rhetoric, but,
in fact, yesterday, he made very
clear that

13:42.588 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
although not everybody will --
all 11 million
will be deported on day one, he
did say that

13:47.760 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the first hour of his
first day of
the presidency, he would
immediately push

13:52.598 --> 13:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have all individuals -- and I
think he
referred to the number two
million individuals

13:58.871 --> 14:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- anyone who's been convicted
of crimes and
bad people, is the way he is
referring to

14:03.009 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us as immigrants -- that they
would be deported.

14:05.478 --> 14:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that really means in
practice, Gwen,
one is, it's an extreme
position, and it's

14:10.116 --> 14:11.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an expensive position.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to deport and have a
deportation
force that would result in the
deportation

14:15.655 --> 14:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 11 million immigrants, we're
talking about
over $6 billion -- or $60
billion.

14:22.829 --> 14:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things in terms of
the current
policies that many people don't
understand

14:27.200 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, current administration,
Obama administration's
policy is to deport criminal --
individuals

14:33.106 --> 14:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with criminal convictions.

14:35.007 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, here in Los
Angeles, organizers
are fighting the deportation of
a grandmother

14:38.778 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was convicted of shoplifting
as a misdemeanor
over 30 years ago.

14:43.116 --> 14:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that really who Donald Trump
thinks are
bad people that should be
deported?

14:47.153 --> 14:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the grandmother of four
U.S. citizen
children.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's raising, helping support
her family.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask Kris
Kobach about what
that happened today.

14:54.927 --> 15:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After his speech last night,
several of Donald
Trump's Hispanic Advisory
Council resigned

15:00.233 --> 15:01.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in disappointment.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said they would no longer
support him.

15:03.703 --> 15:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A, why are they leaving, and are
they justified?

15:07.240 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, B, what was the point of
yesterday's
visit to Mexico in the end, when
there was

15:11.077 --> 15:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such disagreement about what was
said?

15:12.845 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I can't comment on
the two individuals
you talked about.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I haven't seen any statement
from them or
explanation.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or I'm really not familiar with
what they
have decided to do.

15:21.921 --> 15:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as the visit to Mexico,
you know, I
think that was really a pretty
shrewd move

15:27.593 --> 15:29.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Mr. Trump.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was given an invitation.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So was Hillary Clinton.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She declined it, at least for
the time being.

15:34.167 --> 15:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took it and said, look, I'm
going to go
and I'm going to talk to the
president of

15:38.371 --> 15:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our neighbor, neighboring
country.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, they had an
interesting meeting,
by all accounts.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know exactly what was
said, but one
of the interesting things I take
out of it

15:46.813 --> 15:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, they came out of the meeting
and both
recognized that border security
is important.

15:53.352 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Mexican president seemed
to be suggesting
that he, too, thought a wall was
justifiable.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know, that's really
interesting.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, Mr. Trump is not the
president
yet.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was in no position to
argue.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:06.866 --> 16:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm not we listened
to exactly
the same press conference,
because I think

16:09.936 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody agrees about border
security, Democrats,
Republicans, but I -- but we
don't have time

16:14.340 --> 16:16.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to debate all of that.

16:16.175 --> 16:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want to ask Professor
Ramakrishnan, what
is it about a zero-tolerance
argument that

16:22.515 --> 16:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems so effective, or at least
keeps coming
back in our debates about
immigration?

16:26.853 --> 16:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Well,
it's important
to recognize, Gwen, that Donald
Trump's position

16:32.258 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually a minority position,
not only
in the general electorate, which
he needs

16:36.295 --> 16:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to win, but even within the
Republican Party.

16:39.098 --> 16:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a bit surprising that
he doubled
down on the kind of rhetoric
that he did early

16:45.271 --> 16:47.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the primary season.

16:47.206 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a real opportunity for
him to potentially
pivot, right, and maybe not go
as far as many

16:52.945 --> 16:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his advisers were thinking
about.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he used the kind of
language.

16:56.949 --> 17:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know in our research on
framing -- we
have a book coming out on
framing, and as

17:01.621 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it involves immigrants.

17:03.489 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that frames like using
the word amnesty
or talking about the criminal
aspect, which

17:08.327 --> 17:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually -- all the evidence
shows immigrants
are much less likely to commit
crimes than

17:12.798 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the native-born.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But using that kind of language
can fire up
the base.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, he needs to grow that
base.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not sure that he did
that last night.

17:20.840 --> 17:25.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Professor Karthick
Ramakrishnan
and Kris Kobach and Marielena
Hincapie, thank

17:25.845 --> 17:26.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you all very much.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Thank
you, Gwen.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Thank you,
Gwen.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: Thank you.

17:31.150 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Our analysis of
Donald Trump's
stance on immigration continues
online, where

17:35.087 --> 17:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins explores his
plan, and finds
six new key points from his
speech.

17:40.760 --> 17:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

17:46.365 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now we
turn to another
voting bloc in the presidential
election,

17:57.677 --> 17:59.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
veterans.

17:59.478 --> 18:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, the candidates who
are vying to
become the next commander in
chief courted

18:02.048 --> 18:04.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that vote.

18:04.984 --> 18:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump briefly
paused their debate over
immigration this

18:08.754 --> 18:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week to address to the American
Legion.

18:10.790 --> 18:16.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
As the daughter of a veteran, as
a proud American,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am grateful to you all.

18:18.798 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The men and women of the
American Legion represent

18:23.102 --> 18:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the best, absolute best of
America, strength,
courage, selfless devotion.

18:32.578 --> 18:36.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The candidates
voiced their
commitment to veterans and their
families,

18:36.849 --> 18:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also took the chance to go
after each
other.

18:39.585 --> 18:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what do the men and women
that served
in uniform think of their
options for president?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bob Simpson is a Marine Corps
veteran who
served in Vietnam.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB SIMPSON, U.S. Marine Corps
Veteran: I
vote for Trump all the way.

18:49.962 --> 18:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems to be the general case
amongst all
of us veterans, not every one of
course, but

18:57.003 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most of us probably pull to the
Trump side.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gene Miller, a
former Marine,
also served in Vietnam.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE MILLER, U.S. Marine Corps
Veteran: I
believe that Donald Trump is the
one that's

19:06.879 --> 19:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best suited over Hillary.

19:09.749 --> 19:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that Mr. Trump has
several attributes
that is on record as far as
knowing the military.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's up to speed on the
military.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He talks a tough game.

19:22.528 --> 19:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two recent
polls found that
Trump holds a significant
advantage among

19:26.632 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
veterans, 14 percent in one poll
and 11 percent
in another.

19:29.835 --> 19:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when asked who they feel
would be the
most supportive of veterans,
overall, likely

19:34.940 --> 19:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters feel the candidates are
even.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navy veteran Kia Hamel says
Clinton's support
is strongest with recent
veterans.

19:41.580 --> 19:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIA THOMAS HAMEL, Veteran:
Younger veterans,
different ethnicities, females,
LGBT community

19:47.253 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are coming out for Secretary
Clinton, because
she's more of a progressive
candidate.

19:52.725 --> 19:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hamel one of
the first women
to serve on the aircraft carrier
the USS Nimitz,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supports Clinton.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIA THOMAS HAMEL: She is not
going to be a
person that's going to be very
careless and

20:02.401 --> 20:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to use nuclear weapons just
because she's
insulted.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the kind of person
that we need
at the helm.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Both
candidates have stumbled
in dealing with veterans issues.

20:14.346 --> 20:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last summer, Trump responded to
Senator John
McCain, calling his supporters
crazies.

20:18.017 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: He lost.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He let us down.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, you know, he lost.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have never liked him as
much after that,
because I don't like losers.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, Frank, let me get to it.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: He's a war hero.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's a war hero.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's not a war
hero.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: He's a war hero.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:31.230 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a war hero --
he's a war
hero because he was captured.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like people that weren't
captured, OK, I
hate to tell you.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And when the
father of a
Muslim American soldier who was
killed in

20:39.939 --> 20:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq in 2004 condemned Trump's
rhetoric at
this year's Democratic
Convention, Trump attacked

20:46.078 --> 20:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Goldman Sachs family on
television and
social media in the following
days.

20:51.217 --> 20:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton upset some veterans
answering questions
last October about negligent
medical care

20:55.788 --> 20:57.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in certain VA hospitals.

20:57.857 --> 21:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Overall, veterans who do get
treated are satisfied

21:01.127 --> 21:02.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with their treatment.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: More so than people in
the regular
system.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's
exactly right.

21:05.764 --> 21:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, nobody would believe that
from the coverage
that you see and the constant
berating of

21:11.036 --> 21:15.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the VA that comes from
Republicans, in part
in pursuit of this ideological
agenda.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: But, in part, because
there has been
real scandal.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: There
has been, but
it's not been as widespread as
it has been

21:21.814 --> 21:23.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made out to be.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Veterans like
Bob Simpson
and Gene Miller say they're also
concerned

21:26.452 --> 21:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Clinton's response to the
attack on
the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi
and her use

21:30.956 --> 21:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a private e-mail server while
secretary
of state.

21:33.526 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SIMPSON: If that had been
any one of us
with the computers, with
Benghazi, we'd have

21:41.400 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in the jail and they
would've thrown
the key away.

21:43.369 --> 21:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For Kia Hamel,
the biggest
concern about Donald Trump is
what she says

21:47.373 --> 21:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a lack knowledge about world
affairs.

21:49.408 --> 21:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIA THOMAS HAMEL: I think that
he's more of
a danger because of the fact
that he doesn't

21:55.214 --> 21:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know enough about the situations
to make an
educated decision.

22:00.019 --> 22:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan in
Washington.

22:06.859 --> 22:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

22:15.768 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
massive protest
sparked by Venezuela's growing
economic crisis;

22:22.775 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgetown University sets out
to make amends
for its history of slavery; and
Lemony Snicket

22:28.214 --> 22:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explains how he got his pen
name.

22:31.116 --> 22:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: If immigration is
one of this
year's big policy debates, the
other is free

22:36.121 --> 22:37.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trade.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when it comes to the future
of how the
U.S. does business abroad, the
two major candidates

22:42.061 --> 22:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not sounding that far apart.

22:44.463 --> 22:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, correspondent Paul
Solman spoke
with economist Peter Navarro
about Donald

22:49.134 --> 22:51.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's approach.

22:51.036 --> 22:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Paul talks trade with
Ohio Senator
Sherrod Brown, one of Hillary
Clinton's biggest

22:56.041 --> 22:57.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supporters.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

SHERROD BROWN (D), Ohio: Denise?

23:43.055 --> 23:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

American workers and companies.

24:04.443 --> 24:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

more of it,

24:15.254 --> 24:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

triple the number

have by far

24:42.514 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our largest bilateral trade
deficit.

24:45.184 --> 24:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We lost five million jobs from

almost closed

Boss it would

floor.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump outsources his

25:31.029 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could have bought them here.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could have had them made
here.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He outsourced -- outsources his

25:36.902 --> 25:37.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He outsources.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This tie's made in the U.S.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump talks a good game
on trade, but
he's never lived it.

25:43.308 --> 25:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's lined his pockets by
outsourcing jobs
to low-wage countries, and now
he's talking

25:48.881 --> 25:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about trade as if he actually
means it?

25:51.083 --> 25:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been engaged in this

Donald Trump stand with us.

25:58.490 --> 26:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

trust Hillary

trade agreements.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she was in the Senate, she
voted against
some, she voted for some.

26:14.606 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Clinton has taken

Trans-Pacific

26:19.077 --> 26:20.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

26:20.145 --> 26:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As secretary of state, she said:

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: This TPP
sets the
gold standard in trade

26:25.451 --> 26:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

26:28.420 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I will

26:45.637 --> 26:47.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oppose it as president.

26:47.439 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You understand why

say she's absolutely done an
about-face on

26:52.845 --> 26:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue, right, and that she

go back on the position she now

SEN.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHERROD BROWN: Well, she
supported TPP in
the early days because she was
the -- she

27:03.055 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked for the president of the
United States
in his cabinet, and so did
everybody else

27:07.259 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Cabinet support TPP.

27:09.394 --> 27:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a candidate, she understands
it, and she
looks at TPP in a different way,
fixing rules

27:15.167 --> 27:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of origin, fixing currency
issues, fixing
investor-state dispute
settlement, which undermines

27:21.607 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
environmental and worker safety
standards.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In nearby
Cleveland, at the former
site of

27:26.311 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Premier Manufacturing, we met
economist Susan
Helper, a progressive Democrat
who also supports

27:32.417 --> 27:33.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when a plant like this
closes down, there's
substantial economic damage.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN HELPER, Economist: yes.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people in the plant lose
their jobs.

27:41.159 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People working in restaurants
nearby lose
their jobs.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Home values fall, et cetera.

27:46.198 --> 27:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This steel wire
plant, which
moved most of its work to
Mexico, exemplifies

27:50.869 --> 27:52.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the migration of U.S.
manufacturing.

27:52.971 --> 27:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN HELPER: The decline of
unions and the
figuring out by management of
strategies to

27:57.109 --> 28:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
avoid unions in the U.S., and
then a movement,
particularly after NAFTA was
signed, to Mexico,

28:04.750 --> 28:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and even lower wages there.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The North American
Free Trade
Agreement was signed by Bill
Clinton in 1993.

28:11.023 --> 28:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his wife has become a
critic, for good
reason, says Professor Helper.

28:15.093 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN HELPER: I think that one
of the things
now, we have greater experience.

28:18.730 --> 28:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can see what -- what's
happened as a result
of some of the trade agreements.

28:21.433 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's some very excellent work
that suggests
that workers who are displaced
by trade or

28:28.740 --> 28:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other reasons, but particularly
by trade,
don't easily find new jobs.

28:32.411 --> 28:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And particularly in the case of
a lost manufacturing
job, the new job that somebody
gets doesn't

28:37.382 --> 28:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
equal their previous wage.

28:39.217 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But many economists
argue, robots,
not trade deals, are the real
job-robbers.

28:43.722 --> 28:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I asked Sherrod Brown, isn't
it technology
that's actually replacing jobs,
as opposed

28:50.128 --> 28:51.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to unfair trade?

SEN.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHERROD BROWN: Well, it's all of
the above.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's unfair trade practices.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's technology.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About five miles from my home is
a company
called ArcelorMittal.

28:58.670 --> 29:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That plant was the first plant
in world history
where close to one person hour
of labor produces

29:06.778 --> 29:08.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one ton of steel.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's technology, that's
efficiency.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's put some steelworkers out
of work because
they're so efficient.

29:12.651 --> 29:13.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERROD BROWN: But unfair trade
practices
has also -- have also put a lot
of those workers

29:18.423 --> 29:20.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of work.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, Susan
Helper's research
suggests that technology can
actually add

29:23.795 --> 29:26.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs at ArcelorMittal or
anywhere else.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HELPER: When your
productivity goes
up, your price falls, so more
people are going

29:30.936 --> 29:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to want to buy things made out
of steel.

29:33.572 --> 29:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We looked at manufacturing
industries over
the last couple of decades, and
found that

29:38.710 --> 29:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those industries that had the
greatest productivity
growth actually had the most job
gains.

29:43.982 --> 29:44.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But why?

29:44.983 --> 29:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN HELPER: Because they found
new markets.

29:46.852 --> 29:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were able to expand into
new markets
and find new uses for the
technology that

29:51.123 --> 29:52.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they had innovated.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Even so, Sherrod
Brown believes
candidate Clinton's tougher
stance on trade

29:56.695 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a welcome one.

steel plant in the world less
than 10 miles

30:01.600 --> 30:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from here, but we have got a lot
of work to
do to make sure trade
enforcement is done

30:05.837 --> 30:07.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way Secretary Clinton wants
it done.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that -- that will ultimately
provide jobs.

30:10.575 --> 30:11.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will save jobs.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will help manufacturing

HARI SREENIVASAN: In Caracas,
today, hundreds
of thousands of Venezuelans
turned out to

30:33.198 --> 30:38.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protest against President
Nicolas Maduro's
government and called for an end
to his rule.

30:38.437 --> 30:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country has been plagued by
a deepening
economic crisis, corruption,
crime, all of

30:43.508 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which have contributed to a
worsening food
shortage.

Nathan Halverson of Reveal from
the Center
for Investigative Reporting
recently visited

30:50.849 --> 30:52.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Caracas,.

30:52.718 --> 30:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: Well before
sunrise, hungry
Venezuelans are waiting outside
grocery stores

30:57.089 --> 30:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
praying for food trucks to
arrive.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By mid-morning, with streets
crowded with
anxious faces, there is little
hope.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There is only
butter and oil.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need them to send us more
food.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
When did you
get here?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): At
4:00 a.m.

31:10.302 --> 31:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I got
here at 8:00
p.m. last night.

31:14.039 --> 31:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Venezuelans watch their
country crumble
and their desperation and hunger
spill into

31:18.643 --> 31:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the streets, their anger with
President Nicolas
Maduro and his party has become
explosive.

31:24.249 --> 31:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): This
is what's
happening in Venezuela.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're starving.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're struggling, thanks to this
government.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the Maduro diet.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: Police now
guard grocery
stores across the country,
holding back the

31:38.897 --> 31:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hungry and volatile mobs.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Why
are you taking
me out of line?

31:42.300 --> 31:43.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was here early.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I also need food.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: Some 90
percent of Venezuelans
now report that food has become
too expensive

31:48.707 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to buy.

31:50.275 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hungry mobs are increasingly
rioting and looting
bakeries and food trucks.

31:54.312 --> 31:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has forced everyday people
to try and
calm desperate crowds, like this
grocery store

31:59.584 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
manager.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
don't produce
the food.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everyone is waiting for
something to arrive.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it doesn't arrive, we can't
create food
from nothing.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: People are
losing hope that
the government-controlled system
will supply

32:10.529 --> 32:11.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
key items.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they blame the socialist
government for
the scarcity.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
one article
of food per person, and then you
have to wait

32:17.736 --> 32:20.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eight days, because if you try
to buy more,
they will stop you.

32:20.972 --> 32:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: The result is
hunger, and
a country increasingly turning
against President

32:26.378 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nicolas Maduro.

PAULA GIRAUD, Journalist

My friends have lost weight, 15,
20, 25 pounds

32:33.151 --> 32:34.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
even.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: Paula Giraud
is a journalist
who writes a food blog about the
country's

32:37.823 --> 32:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rapidly worsening situation.

32:39.724 --> 32:42.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAULA GIRAUD (through
translator): I'm afraid
there will be, although the
government doesn't

32:42.994 --> 32:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to see it, and I don't want
to either,
a social explosion of immense
proportions.

32:48.033 --> 32:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: Usually, her
only meal for
an entire day is one egg.

32:53.705 --> 32:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA GIRAUD: Only one egg, no
more.

32:57.709 --> 33:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: And she has to
share it
with her dog.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The impacts are widespread.

33:05.116 --> 33:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Schoolchildren are fainting from
hunger.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD (through translator): In
my house, there
is no food.

NATHAN HALVERSON: School
principal Malkis
Mochado (ph) says some students
don't even

33:14.059 --> 33:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have the energy to attend.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: When you were absent from
school, why
didn't you come?

33:19.965 --> 33:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD (through translator):
Because I had
nothing to eat.

33:21.967 --> 33:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: The school now
provides
what is sometimes the only meal
these children

33:25.904 --> 33:26.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
eat.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Food has become political.

33:28.974 --> 33:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In August, the opposition party
started this
school lunch program, winning
the gratitude

33:33.478 --> 33:35.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a hungry community.

33:35.447 --> 33:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for others, food still
remains hard to
find.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I have
a job, but
what's the point?

33:42.220 --> 33:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My salary is worth nothing.

33:43.455 --> 33:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, you can't even get
rice or corn
flour.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For everything, you have to wait
in line.

33:50.495 --> 33:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: After work,
men gather on
street corners to scavenge for
food, rather

33:54.799 --> 33:57.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than skip work to wait in line
all day.

33:58.003 --> 34:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These workers once shopped at
government-subsidized
grocery stores like this one
once, but now

34:02.374 --> 34:06.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the shelves here are completely
empty.

34:06.144 --> 34:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for some well-connected
people, there
are still reliable sources of
food.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Government employees receive
privileged access
at this warehouse.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are government workers and
their friends
carting off items that most
Venezuelans can

34:18.723 --> 34:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no longer afford or even find on
the shelves.

34:24.930 --> 34:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paula Giraud said the government
is using
the food to control people, to
buy their support,

34:29.668 --> 34:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and was outraged by what we
filmed.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAULA GIRAUD (through
translator): Every week
in the country, the hunger
increases.

34:35.173 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The shortages increase and the
corruption
increases.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's what millions and
millions of Venezuelans
are enduring.

34:40.812 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HALVERSON: For the
country, the societal
explosion that many fear seems
to be inching

34:46.785 --> 34:47.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closer every day.

34:48.019 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nathan Halverson
in Caracas.

34:58.496 --> 35:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In recent
years, a number
of prestigious colleges and
universities have

35:09.441 --> 35:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to acknowledge their past
ties and history
to slavery in the U.S.

35:14.012 --> 35:19.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Georgetown University
became the latest
to say it will apologize for its
past and

35:19.217 --> 35:21.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take new steps.

35:21.152 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 200 years ago, the
original Georgetown
College operated plantations in
Maryland that

35:26.324 --> 35:28.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worked with slave labor.

35:28.193 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in 1838, facing deep debt,
a pair of
priests who each served as
president of Georgetown

35:34.933 --> 35:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sold 272 people to help pay the
bills.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The slaves were sent to
plantations in Louisiana.

35:42.507 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help atone for its past, the
university
announced it would give a
special preference

35:46.711 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in admissions to applicants who
are descendants
of Georgetown's slaves.

35:51.683 --> 35:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also renaming a building in
honor of
one of the slaves, erecting a
public memorial,

35:57.489 --> 36:01.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and creating an institute to
study slavery
and its legacy.

36:01.326 --> 36:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University president John
DeGioia spoke at
a news conference today.

36:04.696 --> 36:09.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DEGIOIA, President,
Georgetown University:
So many were surprised, even
shocked, by the

36:09.401 --> 36:15.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
revelation of Jesuit
slaveholding and the
benefit we received from the
1830 sale.

36:15.240 --> 36:25.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As a community and as
individuals, we cannot
do our best work if we refuse to
take ownership

36:25.050 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of such a critical part of our
history.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We must acknowledge it.

36:30.321 --> 36:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For a closer
look at this,
I'm joined from New York by
Craig Steven Wilder.

36:33.691 --> 36:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a professor of American
history at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and
author of "Ebony

36:38.496 --> 36:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the
Troubled History
of America's Universities."

36:42.400 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Wilder, put this in context
for us.

36:44.302 --> 36:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How crucial was this transaction
of people
to keep Georgetown alive?

36:48.940 --> 36:52.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER,
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology: You know, in
1838, Georgetown

36:52.177 --> 36:57.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sold -- the president of
Georgetown helped
negotiate the sale of about 272
people to

36:57.315 --> 36:59.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Louisiana.

36:59.150 --> 37:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from what we understand,
about 15 to 20
percent of the money, the
proceeds, actually

37:04.122 --> 37:06.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was used to pay down
Georgetown's debts.

37:06.524 --> 37:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's actually
quite crucial
to the continued survival of the
university.

37:11.463 --> 37:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is about the time that the
university
imposed tuition for the first
time.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it was helping to meet a
number of
financial needs.

37:19.137 --> 37:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
your thoughts
on the university's actions
today?

37:23.241 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: I thought
that the report
was thorough and quite
thoughtful, but the

37:28.546 --> 37:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real meaning of the report --
I'm cautiously
optimistic -- I think the real
meaning of

37:32.217 --> 37:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the report will get revealed
over the next
several years and decades, as we
see Georgetown

37:38.189 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
implement these promises.

37:39.991 --> 37:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it will depend upon how
fully those get
institutionalized on the campus,
and so that

37:46.064 --> 37:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can actually see them really
get achieved.

37:47.966 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how --
today, there
was a clause in there about
admissions preference.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

37:54.973 --> 37:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: Well, I
think what they're
doing is, they're looking at the
descendants

37:58.209 --> 38:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 272 people who were sold
in 1838, and
seeking to bring them to campus
and to give

38:05.884 --> 38:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them preferential admission to
Georgetown,
actually like a lot of
populations of students

38:11.055 --> 38:12.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

38:12.857 --> 38:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, the children of
alumni often
get preferential treatment in
admissions.

38:17.328 --> 38:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this would extend that to
the children
of the people sold -- or the
descendants of

38:21.499 --> 38:23.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the people sold in 1838.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How does this
compare to
what other schools are doing
these days?

38:26.571 --> 38:34.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: That step
is actually
-- takes the response to slavery
further than

38:34.512 --> 38:37.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any other institution has gone.

38:37.749 --> 38:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other actions inside the
report actually
are fairly similar to what other
institutions

38:44.622 --> 38:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done, for instance, the
renaming of two
of the buildings on the
Georgetown campus,

38:49.294 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the decision to create a
memorial to slavery
on the campus, and the decision
to establish

38:54.899 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an institute for the study of
slavery.

38:56.768 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
dangers is that
this almost creates a checklist
for a university

39:01.472 --> 39:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that says, OK, fine, I have got
a memorial,
check.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to do this, check.

39:04.709 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that long-lasting change
you're talking
about, that could take years to
get through

39:09.681 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the student body and the entire
campus.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: And I think
that's the
key to this.

39:14.986 --> 39:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A report does not bring closure
to the story
of Georgetown's relationship to
slavery.

39:21.559 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will ultimately begin to, I
hope, heal
and repair the relationship
between Georgetown,

39:27.832 --> 39:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Catholic Church and the
descendants of
the people sold in 1838 will be,
in fact,

39:33.104 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgetown fulfilling these
commitments in
a really quite holistic way.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And does this
blaze the
trail for other universities,
considering

39:40.545 --> 39:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there are already some that
are tackling
this?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: I think it
does.

39:44.515 --> 39:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what you will see
is, in fact,
a continued conversation about
the legacies

39:49.420 --> 39:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of slavery on our campuses, and
also the thing
that's actually has kept much of
this discussion

39:54.559 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alive for the past several
years, student
activism on campus, which has,
in fact, been

39:59.297 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the instrument for keeping this
conversation
alive.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, has
Georgetown taken
steps to try to track down the
descendants?

40:06.638 --> 40:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, when you think about
it, 272 people
from the 1800s, that actually
could be thousands

40:11.242 --> 40:13.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people by now.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: Right.

40:15.046 --> 40:19.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the sort of
remarkable things about
the Georgetown situation is that
the records

40:19.150 --> 40:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Jesuits kept of that
sale are actually
really quite complete.

40:24.756 --> 40:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, with the assistance --
actually, really,
in many ways, the alumni sort of
pushed this

40:30.561 --> 40:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation, members of the
alumni community
of Georgetown, and actually
helped to both

40:35.767 --> 40:40.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund and encourage the process
of reaching
out and going out to Louisiana
and helping

40:40.772 --> 40:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to track the genealogies of the
families who
are related to those 272 slaves.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we're
talking a lot
about Georgetown today and a few
other schools,

40:50.481 --> 40:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, really, when you look up
and down the
Eastern Seaboard for hundreds of
years, all

40:54.619 --> 40:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the early, early colleges
likely had some
of this in their past.

40:59.090 --> 41:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: Yes, every
college established
before the American Revolution
-- there are

41:03.094 --> 41:07.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine colleges established before
the revolution
in the British colonies.

41:07.198 --> 41:11.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're all, in fact,
established by slave
traders and slave owners.

41:11.202 --> 41:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the American Revolution,
we established
17 colleges, one every year
until 1800.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those colleges have close ties
to slavery
because they're founded with the
recovery

41:20.678 --> 41:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the slave economy after the
war.

41:22.847 --> 41:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the decades before the
Civil War, it's
the rise of the cotton economy
that drives

41:27.618 --> 41:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the expansion of American higher
education.

41:30.021 --> 41:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the story of American
education, higher
education in particular, is the
story of American

41:34.592 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
slavery.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Craig Steven
Wilder, thanks so much.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAIG STEVEN WILDER: Thank you.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Online, the
discussion of
race continues.

41:41.733 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Milwaukee was rocked by riots
last month after
a young man was killed by
police.

41:46.637 --> 41:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked to community leaders
and city officials
about the city's history of
segregation and

41:50.742 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what hope there is for future
generations.

41:56.414 --> 42:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to another of
our Brief But
Spectacular interviews.

42:08.192 --> 42:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Daniel
Handler, a name
you may only recognize if we
identify him

42:13.164 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by his alias, Lemony Snicket.

42:15.600 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL HANDLER, Author: When I
was researching
my first novel, "The Basic
Eight," I was calling

42:22.607 --> 42:27.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up right-wing religious
organization and political
groups in order to make fun of
them.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought to myself, I
better not tell
her my real name.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will be on their mailing list
forever.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she said, "What is your
name?"

42:33.785 --> 42:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I said, "Lemony Snicket."

42:35.753 --> 42:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then there was a pause.

42:38.122 --> 42:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, out of all the
things you could
have said, that was the worst
one.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one was going to believe
that.

42:43.461 --> 42:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the woman from the
right-wing organization
said, "Is that spelled how it
sounds?"

42:54.305 --> 42:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was 5 years old, someone
asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,
and I said

42:57.842 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I wanted to be an old man
who lived on
the top of a mountain giving
advice.

43:01.045 --> 43:02.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't remember it.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All I remember is wanting to be
a writer.

43:04.348 --> 43:05.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would read on the bus.

43:05.817 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would miss the bus because I
was reading.

43:08.119 --> 43:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first book that I bought
with my own money
was "The Blue Aspic" by Edward
Gorey.

43:12.790 --> 43:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, when the first two
volumes of "A
Series of Unfortunate Events"
were ready to

43:16.794 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be published, I sent them to
Edward Gorey
with a note saying how much I
admired his

43:20.631 --> 43:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work and how much I hoped that
he would forgive
what I had stolen from him.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shortly after I sent it, he
died.

43:27.672 --> 43:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I like to think that I
killed him.

43:29.941 --> 43:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much of children's literature
is about
enforced fun or enforced
morality.

43:34.045 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surely, you will be rewarded if
you behave
this way, or aren't you having a
wonderful

43:38.783 --> 43:40.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time reading about this?

43:40.718 --> 43:41.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you never are.

43:41.886 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it never goes that way.

43:43.754 --> 43:47.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, part of "A Series of
Unfortunate Events"
was an acknowledgment of the
bewildering state

43:47.058 --> 43:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of affair that is childhood.

43:48.860 --> 43:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you have a notebook
on you right
now?

43:52.196 --> 43:53.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL HANDLER: I do.

43:53.197 --> 43:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do have a notebook on me right
now.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is my notebook.

43:58.169 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think of things or I read
them, and then
I write them down in the
notebook.

44:02.340 --> 44:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I type it onto a document on my
computer,
tape them or paste on to index
cards.

44:07.745 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I move all the index cards
around.

44:10.114 --> 44:12.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I write it on a legal pad
longhand.

44:12.250 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I type up the legal pad onto
another document.

44:15.152 --> 44:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It makes me look largely like a
serial killer.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I work in public, people
clutch their
children tighter because they're
walking by

44:21.225 --> 44:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man sipping an espresso moving
pasted index
cards around and writing on a
legal pad.

44:26.964 --> 44:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That man's not to be trusted.

44:28.466 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: You say, it's OK, I'm
writing a
children's book.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL HANDLER: Yes.

44:32.103 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I say, don't worry.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm in narrative prose.

44:34.605 --> 44:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A writer's relationship with
rejection is
like that of a fish to water.

44:39.577 --> 44:40.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all that's there.

44:41.012 --> 44:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you should feel it and
feel utter
despair and then move on.

44:47.718 --> 44:52.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was going to say something
about technology's
influence on reading, but then I
got a text,

44:52.123 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I just have to answer it.

44:53.558 --> 44:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can I just -- I will be right
back.

44:55.293 --> 44:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a triumph of finding
specific things
and an utter failure of finding
something

44:58.062 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you didn't know you were
looking for.

44:59.764 --> 45:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I exist in a state of
bewilderment almost
all of the time.

45:02.934 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Am I grasping at the hem of some
large idea
that is worth investigating?

45:08.372 --> 45:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I mull this over all day
long, whether
this thing that I'm pulling is a
thread that

45:14.211 --> 45:18.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will lead me through the
labyrinth or just
a thread that will dismantle the
sweater.
