JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.472 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
U.S. economy
shows signs of sustained
strength, adding

00:12.379 --> 00:16.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
292,000 jobs in December,
despite global turmoil.

00:16.617 --> 00:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, almost six months after
escaping a high-security
prison, the Mexican drug lord
known as El

00:23.056 --> 00:25.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chapo is arrested.

00:25.092 --> 00:31.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Miles O'Brien unwraps the
latest health-related
technology from the Consumer
Electronics Show.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEILSON, CEO, femtoScale:
Can we use
all this data we can get from
all sorts of

00:35.569 --> 00:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different things, not only to
keep people
healthy once they're in the
hospital, but

00:39.273 --> 00:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prevent them from getting sick
in the first
place?

00:41.808 --> 00:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
David Brooks
and David Corn are here, to
analyze the week's

00:47.080 --> 00:48.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:48.081 --> 00:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.389 --> 00:58.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.225 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The December jobs
numbers are
in, and they show employers were
in a hiring

01:08.435 --> 01:13.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mood. According to the
Department of Labor,
monthly surveys found that U.S.
businesses

01:13.740 --> 01:18.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
added a net of more than 290,000
positions.

01:18.545 --> 01:24.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate was
unchanged, at 5
percent, as more people went
looking for work

01:24.184 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and found it. We will hear from
the secretary
of labor, Thomas Perez, after
the news summary.

01:30.424 --> 01:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has vetoed a
Republican bill
that would have repealed the
Affordable Care

01:35.896 --> 01:41.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act. He said today it would
reverse significant
progress in improving health
care. This was

01:41.368 --> 01:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first such repeal measure to
reach the
Oval Office.

01:44.671 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in a video statement, House
Speaker Paul
Ryan said it may not be the
last.

01:48.976 --> 01:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We have shown now that there is
a clear path

01:53.347 --> 01:59.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to repealing Obamacare without
60 votes in
the Senate. So, next year, if
we're sending

01:59.486 --> 02:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this bill to a Republican
president, it will
get signed into law.

02:03.557 --> 02:08.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bill had
enough votes in
the House to override a
presidential veto,

02:08.228 --> 02:10.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but not in the Senate.

02:10.130 --> 02:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also made moves
today on fighting
violent extremism. They include
a task force

02:16.003 --> 02:21.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to counter the use of social
media to radicalize
and recruit. Senior
administration officials

02:21.975 --> 02:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traveled to Silicon Valley today
to get the
tech industry's help.

02:26.747 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Islamic State affiliate in
Libya has claimed
responsibility for a deadly
truck bombing.

02:32.219 --> 02:38.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The explosion rocked a police
base outside
Tripoli on Thursday, as hundreds
of recruits

02:38.458 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were training. At least 47
people were killed
and scores more were wounded.

02:44.631 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, investigators in
Belgium say they
have discovered an apartment
where Islamic

02:49.302 --> 02:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State militants made bombs for
the Paris attacks
last November. A raid in
Brussels turned up

02:55.108 --> 03:01.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide belts and bomb-making
gear. The attacks
killed 130 people.

03:01.815 --> 03:07.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, relief agencies waited
today for
the green light to enter a town
that is literally

03:07.120 --> 03:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starving to death. The Syrian
government has
now agreed to let relief into
Madaya, in the

03:12.859 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
northwest, near the border with
Lebanon.

03:15.762 --> 03:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Geraint Vincent of Independent
Television
News filed this report.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And be advised: Some of the
images may be
disturbing.

03:22.369 --> 03:28.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERAINT VINCENT: In the
desperate neighborhoods
of Madaya, the people are to be
found huddled

03:28.208 --> 03:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around their stoves. The old man
here takes
delivery of a small bag of olive
leaves.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Can you not bring us some
rice?," he asks.

03:38.685 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the leaves are the nearest
thing to food
he will see today. There is at
least some

03:43.323 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
water to boil them in.

03:45.959 --> 03:51.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't independently verify
these pictures,
but at the hospital, the doctors
say the emergency

03:51.965 --> 03:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are trying to cope with is
getting worse
and worse. This man hasn't eaten
for 25 days,

03:57.737 --> 04:02.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're told, and he's one of
hundreds being
kept alive with medication and
spoonfuls of

04:02.943 --> 04:04.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
food.

04:04.711 --> 04:09.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laying siege to towns full of
civilians is
a tactic employed on both sides
of Syria's

04:09.716 --> 04:14.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war. It is forces loyal to
President Assad
which have cut off Madaya. His
government

04:14.988 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it will allow humanitarian
access. Aid
agencies hope to get food in
there by Sunday.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABEER ETEFA, United Nations
World Food Program:
We know that when people are
besieged and

04:24.131 --> 04:28.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are cut off from supplies, that
the situation
will be bad. We know that there
will be high

04:28.902 --> 04:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rates of malnutrition, severe
malnutrition,
stunting among children, health
issues, diseases.

04:35.575 --> 04:40.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that usually the
children, the women,
the elderly will pay a heavy
price.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERAINT VINCENT: Aid might get
through soon,
but the uncertainties of war
mean it might

04:44.918 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not. The time is running out for
the people
of Madaya, and so is what passes
for food

04:50.724 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Syrian
government wants
to wrest back control of Madaya
to secure

04:55.695 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply lines to its Hezbollah
militia allies
in Lebanon.

05:00.100 --> 05:06.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
South Korea fired up its
loudspeakers today
near the demilitarized zone, and
blasted propaganda

05:06.473 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into North Korea. The
high-decibel criticism
attacked the North Korean regime
and its leader,

05:12.612 --> 05:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-un. One message claimed
that Kim
and his wife wear clothing that
costs thousands

05:18.585 --> 05:24.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars. Seoul resumed the
broadcasts after
the North carried out a nuclear
test.

05:24.357 --> 05:29.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And South Koreans near the DMZ
seemed supportive.

05:29.162 --> 05:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): No
wonder the South
Korean government has started
the loudspeaker

05:34.734 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broadcasts. We cannot tolerate
those who conduct
a nuclear test, which was a
violation, don't

05:39.206 --> 05:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you think? We should counteract
it.

05:41.241 --> 05:46.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past,
North Korea has
branded the broadcasts an act of
war. It responded

05:46.680 --> 05:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late today with propaganda
broadcasts of its
own.

05:50.016 --> 05:56.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Adolf Hitler's political
manifesto, "Mein
Kampf," went on sale in Germany
today for

05:56.122 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first time since World War
II, and demand
quickly outstripped supply. The
initial print

06:02.262 --> 06:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run was for 4,000 copies, but
15,000 orders
flooded the publisher. The
two-volume work

06:09.636 --> 06:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
includes critical annotations
that debunk
the Nazi leader's claims.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS WIRSCHING, Director,
Institute for
Contemporary History (through
translator):

06:18.311 --> 06:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This edition exposes the false
information
spread by Hitler, his downright
lies and his

06:24.651 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many half-truths, which aimed at
a pure propaganda
effect.

06:28.822 --> 06:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For decades, the
German state
of Bavaria used its copyright on
"Mein Kampf"

06:34.261 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to block any new editions, but
the copyright
expired at the end of 2015.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, police in
Philadelphia
say a man who ambushed and
wounded an officer

06:44.237 --> 06:50.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night pledged loyalty to
the Islamic
State group. The suspect, Edward
Archer, is

06:50.143 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in custody. His mother says he'd
been hearing
voices recently, and that his
family had urged

06:55.415 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to get help. Surveillance
video shows
the gunman firing more than a
dozen shots

07:00.587 --> 07:05.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at officer Jesse Hartnett, who
was sitting
in his cruiser. Hartnett shot
back and wounded

07:05.692 --> 07:07.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attacker.

07:07.627 --> 07:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports of sexual assaults have
spiked at
U.S. military academies. The
Associated Press

07:12.766 --> 07:18.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports they rose more than 50
percent during
just the past school year. It's
not clear

07:18.171 --> 07:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether that's mostly because
assaults are
actually on the rise or whether
victims are

07:22.976 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more willing to come forward.

07:25.845 --> 07:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street continues its slump
again today,
amid ongoing worries about
China's economy

07:30.750 --> 07:39.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and falling oil prices. The Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 167 points to close
below 16350.

07:39.359 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 46, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped 21. For the week, the
Dow and the

07:45.699 --> 07:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
S&amp;P lost 6 percent, the worst
since 2011.
The Nasdaq fell 7 percent.

07:52.005 --> 07:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, a new world record
for mass
tooth brushing. More than 17,500
children

07:59.346 --> 08:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gathered in Bangalore, India,
yesterday to
highlight good oral hygiene.
That should easily

08:05.552 --> 08:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surpass the old mark for most
people brushing
their teeth in one place.

08:09.723 --> 08:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It makes you feel clean just
looking at them.

08:13.760 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the U.S.
labor secretary on a solid year
in job growth;

08:19.399 --> 08:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico's infamous drug lord
captured again;
outrage over mass sexual
assaults in Germany;

08:30.009 --> 08:44.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

08:44.224 --> 08:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The final jobs U.S. report for
2015 helped
finish the year off with solid
growth. Overall,

08:50.530 --> 08:57.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy added 2.6 million
jobs last year.
Combined with 2014, that led to
a two-year

08:57.270 --> 09:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gain in jobs that was the best
since the late
'90s.

09:00.607 --> 09:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yet, wage growth remained
slow or modest
at best for the year, around 2.5
percent.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Perez is the secretary of
labor, and he
joins me now.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to the program.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ, U.S. Secretary of
Labor: Pleasure
to be with you and all your
viewers.

09:13.753 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is a
strong year of
growth. I saw one report that
said it's -- called

09:17.957 --> 09:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it a red-hot hiring spree.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's behind this? What was
driving this?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, your
introduction is really
spot on.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at the last two
years, not simply
the last month -- and, by the
way, the best

09:29.302 --> 09:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month of -- the best quarter of
2015 was the
last quarter of 2015 -- when you
look at the

09:34.507 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last two years, this is the best
two-year
stretch we have had since the
late '90s.

09:40.146 --> 09:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at auto sales. Last
year was the
hottest year for auto sales in
history. You

09:47.287 --> 09:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the -- you look at the
fact that this
six-year stretch of auto sales
is the best

09:52.859 --> 09:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretch we have had since the
end of World
War II. And you look at not only
the quantity

09:56.996 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of jobs, Judy, but the quality
of jobs, because
what we're seeing over the last
two years

10:02.068 --> 10:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not only good numbers, but
very good quality.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look at, for instance,
professional
and business services. That's
been the biggest

10:09.209 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth area over the last two
years. These
are good jobs. Construction had
a good year

10:12.846 --> 10:19.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last year. And with the
infrastructure bill
that passed at the end of last
year, I expect

10:19.385 --> 10:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction will continue to do
well.

10:21.254 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health care, notwithstanding the
truth deniers
who say the ACA is a job killer,
the health

10:28.328 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care has been a recession...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The health care
law.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: That's been a
recession-proof
industry.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, quantity and quality has
been moving forward,
and that's a good thing.

10:36.669 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, much of the
underlying
data is strong, Mr. Secretary,
but there still

10:40.707 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are some signs of concern.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Sure.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you if it's
concern. It looks as if jobs
that pay at the

10:47.480 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher end, people earning more,
are doing
better than those in the middle-
and lower-income

10:53.253 --> 10:56.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels. Wage -- as we just
mentioned, wage
growth is stagnant.

10:56.389 --> 11:02.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do you explain that
persistent stubbornness
in terms of getting wages
higher?

11:02.896 --> 11:08.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, what
invariably happens
in a recovery is the jobs that
come back first

11:08.401 --> 11:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the lower-paying jobs, and
that's what
happened in this recovery.

11:11.604 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now what you're seeing in recent
years, which
is a good thing, is that more
jobs that pay

11:15.475 --> 11:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better are coming back. And
that's what I
was mentioning about the last
two years. The

11:21.047 --> 11:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge of wage stagnation is
an undeniable
challenge and it predates the
great recession.

11:27.787 --> 11:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year's real wage growth of
2.1 percent
was the best we have had since
the recovery

11:33.192 --> 11:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began. And so that's solid, but
that's not
enough. And, again, this issue
dates back

11:38.698 --> 11:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to really the late '70s. And for
decades after
World War II, productivity and
real wage growth

11:46.072 --> 11:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went hand in hand. Americans
helped bake the
pie of prosperity and they
shared in those

11:51.411 --> 11:53.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefits.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it became delinked
starting in the
late '70s, with the exception of
the end of

11:56.749 --> 12:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Clinton administration. And
so we still
have real work to do on real
wage growth.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the unfinished business.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
like something,
though, that you expect to
continue, the slow

12:06.893 --> 12:08.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wage...

12:08.695 --> 12:11.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, last year,
again, was
the best year we have seen in
the recovery.

12:11.197 --> 12:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the end of the Clinton
administration,
the unemployment rate was 4
percent. And so

12:16.002 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the things we can do to
put upward
pressure on wages is to continue
to have tight

12:20.340 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
labor markets. Another thing we
can do is
to raise the minimum wage.
Another thing we

12:24.744 --> 12:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do is the regulations the
president has
directed us to do to make sure
that people

12:28.915 --> 12:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who work overtime get paid
overtime.

12:31.184 --> 12:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then investing in skills is
a tried-and-true
method of helping people get
access to those

12:36.689 --> 12:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle-class jobs that are out
there in I.T.
and other sectors.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Broaden this out
for us. We
know that, globally, China is
slowing down.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done a lot of reporting
on that, what's
happening to China's market.
That's having

12:47.834 --> 12:48.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
global repercussions.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Sure.

12:49.802 --> 12:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then you have
oil, the
price of oil, at record lows.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much do you worry about the
effect of
things like that on the U.S.
economy and U.S.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs?

12:59.612 --> 13:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, the price of
oil as it
is now for consumers is an
unmitigated boon.

13:04.884 --> 13:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You go to a gas pump, and you're
paying less
than $2 a gallon. The average
family last

13:10.256 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year had about $500 to $800 of
additional
money in their pockets. That's
good for consumers.

13:16.029 --> 13:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what do they do with that
money? They
spend it. And so you see very
good numbers

13:21.234 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on consumer spending in the
United States.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unless you're
working in the
oil industry.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: And, of course,
the challenge
for those working in the sector
-- and we

13:28.474 --> 13:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen that impact in the
mining sector,
which is where the oil jobs are
found.

13:34.213 --> 13:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, the headwinds
from China,
and others in the strong dollar,
it's more

13:40.620 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult to manufacture, and so
the manufacturing
numbers in 2015 weren't as good.

13:46.059 --> 13:50.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, again, we had these
headwinds in 2015
as well. I did a lot of numbers
days interviews

13:50.897 --> 13:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people said the market was
volatile over
the last two weeks. Isn't --
isn't -- the

13:55.468 --> 13:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job numbers, aren't they going
to go down?

13:58.037 --> 14:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look, and you see we
have had two
years in a row of north of
200,000 jobs a

14:05.378 --> 14:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
month on average. That's solid.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other thing I
want to ask
you about, Mr. Secretary, is the
labor force

14:10.750 --> 14:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
participation rate. It continues
at what I
understand to be a four-decade
low. What is

14:17.590 --> 14:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, 62 percent of Americans who
want to be
or would like to be in the labor
force actually

14:24.497 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a job.

14:26.299 --> 14:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So how do you -- what's the
prospect for the
future for people who want to
work, either

14:30.503 --> 14:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the job they want or
don't have
any job?

14:33.606 --> 14:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, the labor
force participation
rate over the last year has been
basically

14:38.745 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same. It's about 62.6
percent.

14:42.215 --> 14:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been a very narrow
band. And the
reason it has gone down from,
say, 10 years

14:47.987 --> 14:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, 15 years ago, even five
years ago, the
primary reason it's gone down is
because of

14:52.892 --> 14:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the aging of the population.
Economists say
that roughly 50 percent of the
reduction in

14:58.297 --> 15:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labor force participation is
attributable
to demographics.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main thing that we could do
to increase
labor force participation at a
policy level

15:08.641 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to enact federal paid leave.
The countries
that have enacted paid leave
laws -- and Canada

15:15.114 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a great example. In 2000, the
female labor
force participation in the U.S.
and Canada

15:19.285 --> 15:21.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was identical.

15:21.053 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of their investment in
paid leave,
they are now 8 percent ahead of
the United

15:24.290 --> 15:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. If we had kept pace, we
would have
5.5 million more women in the
workplace, making

15:29.395 --> 15:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Silicon Valley and Wall
Street look more
like America, making our
Medicare trust fund

15:34.066 --> 15:36.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Social Security trust fund
more secure.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a big debate
about that
right now out on the campaign
trail.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Amen.

15:40.306 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Labor Secretary
Tom Perez,
thank you very much.

15:47.046 --> 15:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Always a pleasure.

15:52.919 --> 15:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The words from
Mexico's president,
Enrique Pena Nieto, this
afternoon said it

15:59.725 --> 16:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all: "Mission accomplished. We
have him."

16:02.662 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The him is perhaps the world's
most-notorious
drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, known
as El Chapo,

16:09.268 --> 16:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ringleader of the Sinaloa
cartel. He was
arrested after a fierce gun
battle today,

16:15.007 --> 16:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly six months after his
elaborate escape
from a high-security prison.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to Hari Sreenivasan for
more.

16:21.714 --> 16:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm joined now
by Alfredo
Corchado, director of the
Borderlands program

16:26.219 --> 16:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Cronkite School of
Journalism at Arizona
State University. He has also
reported for

16:30.323 --> 16:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many years from Mexico for The
Dallas Morning
News, and is author of "Midnight
in Mexico,"

16:35.628 --> 16:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a book about his experience
covering the brutal
drug war.

16:39.198 --> 16:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start with the basics.
What happened?
Where was he? How did he get
captured?

16:43.236 --> 16:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO, Arizona State
University:
Well, he was captured this
morning right before

16:46.138 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dawn, intense firefight between
the marines
and drug traffickers, people
close to or guarding

16:53.212 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Chapo Guzman.

16:55.014 --> 16:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we know is that, since last
July, the
marines, with the help of U.S.
intelligence,

16:59.118 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been tracking him in several
Mexican states,
including Sinaloa, where he was
captured this

17:04.090 --> 17:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning, the state of Durango,
and even Tabasco.

17:08.694 --> 17:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This -- there were two
confrontations, from
what we know, the first one at a
private home

17:13.966 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then he was later captured
at a motel.
Five of his trusted bodyguards
were killed,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and at least one marine was
wounded.

17:21.107 --> 17:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is the
second time
the president of Mexico has gone
on national

17:26.012 --> 17:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television and said they have
got this guy.
I mean, this is an important
win.

17:30.616 --> 17:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: This is the
second time
for President Pena Nieto, and
the third time

17:35.988 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a Mexican president has
said that.

17:39.525 --> 17:43.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, you know, "Mission
accomplished,"
but I think a lot of people will
feel that

17:43.496 --> 17:48.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the mission has not been
accomplished until
Chapo actually faces justice.
And the best

17:48.701 --> 17:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance of doing that will be on
the U.S. side.

17:51.103 --> 17:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of tangling
already going
on, a lot of debate as to
whether he will

17:56.309 --> 17:57.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be extradited this time.

17:57.977 --> 18:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And let's talk
a little
bit about that. The United
States has asked

18:02.315 --> 18:05.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for extradition. Do you think
that that is
a greater possibility now?

18:05.685 --> 18:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: I think the
timing is -- it's
much better than last time.

18:11.023 --> 18:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, the first time he was
captured, there
was a lot of angst, a lot of
reticence within

18:15.895 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Mexican government. There
was the suspicion
that you don't want to let the
Americans get

18:21.600 --> 18:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too close, come in too close.

18:23.869 --> 18:29.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But after this huge
embarrassment that went
worldwide, I think there is a
sense that this

18:29.508 --> 18:33.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
may be good for Mexican
government. This obviously
will be good for the U.S.
government.

18:33.813 --> 18:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But keep in mind that Chapo
Guzman has a vast
army of lawyers. And I'm sure
that the -- even

18:39.418 --> 18:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before he's captured, there was
already a
fight to -- for temporary
injunctions that

18:45.057 --> 18:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prohibit or that would stop an
extradition.
It may happen, but I think it's
a long, long

18:53.733 --> 18:55.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ways before this happens.

18:55.468 --> 18:59.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
involvement was there,
if any, by the U.S. in assisting
with the

19:00.006 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capture?

19:01.774 --> 19:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Well, my
sources tell me
that the U.S. has been helping
the Mexican

19:05.745 --> 19:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marines since the capture with
intelligence,
but, unlike the first time,
there were no

19:10.750 --> 19:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. agents on the ground
assisting the Mexican
marines and the federal police.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a -- was primarily a
Mexican operation.

19:19.892 --> 19:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
Chapo Guzman already
had almost folklore status, but
that prison

19:26.098 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break and how elaborate it was
just six months
ago really sealed it.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Right.

19:33.039 --> 19:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, the premiere of the
movie "Chapo"
is in Mexico City. They're
expecting at least

19:39.845 --> 19:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four other movies this year.
There's talk
about a series, or there have
been books.

19:45.985 --> 19:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be interesting to see
how people in
regions in Mexico, especially
Sinaloa, how

19:50.423 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they will react.

19:52.258 --> 19:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will they come out and protest
again because
of this arrest? Will they let it
go? I'm sure

19:57.196 --> 20:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there will be -- I'm sure there
are already
songs being written at this
moment, as we

20:00.232 --> 20:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speak, about Chapo's latest
capture.

20:02.568 --> 20:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there some
sense that
this will be a more significant
blow to the

20:08.507 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug cartels? In some ways, his
capture or
his escape seems to be almost
representative

20:14.814 --> 20:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Mexican government's
ability to tackle
the drug war.

20:19.618 --> 20:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: And the
ability to try to
create a country with rule of
law.

20:24.290 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what is interesting
about today's
capture is that Chapo's main
lieutenant known

20:29.695 --> 20:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as El Cholo Ivan was also
captured. So, that's
a huge blow to the Sinaloa
cartel.

20:33.599 --> 20:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we have seen, the
Sinaloa cartel,
for a long time, has been really
under the

20:38.370 --> 20:44.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
control of Zambada, Mayo
Zambada. So, that
-- there might be some
territorial fights

20:44.443 --> 20:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in places like Ciudad Juarez,
and Chihuahua,
other places, but it's business
as usual,

20:50.583 --> 20:54.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as long as you have U.S. demand,
I think the
drugs will continue to come up
north.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alfredo Corchado,
director of the Borderlands
program at the

20:58.057 --> 21:01.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cronkite School of Journalism at
Arizona State,
thanks so much for joining us.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Thank you.

21:05.631 --> 21:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:14.073 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
newest gadgets
to boost your health; and David
Brooks and

21:19.411 --> 21:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Corn on this week's news.

21:21.881 --> 21:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, in the German city
of Cologne,
more than 100 women have filed
complaints

21:27.820 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about being sexually molested by
men described
as being of -- quote -- "North
African or

21:33.325 --> 21:35.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Arab origin."

21:35.127 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks have polarized
public opinion
in Germany over its open door
policy, which

21:39.698 --> 21:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has seen it take in more than a
million asylum
seekers amid the refugee crisis.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Cologne, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

21:48.874 --> 21:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dominated by
its magnificent
cathedral, Cologne has a
reputation for great

21:55.781 --> 22:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tolerance. But the city's
open-mindedness
has been stretched to the limit
by what happened

22:01.220 --> 22:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beneath the spires and near the
railway station
as the new year fireworks were
let off in

22:06.792 --> 22:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aggressive manner by some of
those in the
crowd.

22:09.628 --> 22:22.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took several days for the
full extent of
the criminal activity to be
revealed. This

22:22.174 --> 22:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young woman, who asked to remain
anonymous,
was one of more than 100 who
were assaulted.

22:27.713 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): All
of a sudden,
these men around us began
groping us. They

22:32.351 --> 22:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touched our behinds and grabbed
between our
legs. They touched us
everywhere. So, my girlfriend

22:37.022 --> 22:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to get out of the crowd.
When I turned
around, one guy grabbed my bag
and ripped

22:41.060 --> 22:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it off my body. I thought to
myself that,
if we stay here in this crowd,
they could

22:45.130 --> 22:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kill us, they could rape us, and
nobody would
notice.

22:48.267 --> 22:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought we simply had to
accept it. There
was no one around us who helped
or was in

22:52.404 --> 22:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a position to help. All I wanted
was to get
out. I was scared that I
wouldn't leave this

22:58.244 --> 23:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crowd alive. I was scared that
if someone
showed up with a knife, I could
be raped in

23:02.281 --> 23:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the middle of the street.

23:05.150 --> 23:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have nightmares at night and I
can't sleep
anymore. I am too scared to go
outside on

23:09.288 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my own. And, of course, I'm now
scared to
go to big cities.

23:12.424 --> 23:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Writer Alice
Schwarzer is
regarded as one of Germany's
leading women's

23:17.429 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights activists. She believes
what happened
in Cologne marks a line in the
sand in the

23:22.735 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate over immigration.

23:24.637 --> 23:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICE SCHWARZER, Women's Rights
Activist (through
translator): In the last 40
years, we have

23:28.207 --> 23:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very successfully fought for our
rights as
women, for our freedom, for our
access to

23:32.278 --> 23:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, and that we are free
to move around
in it. And it's going to stay
that way, of

23:36.515 --> 23:38.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
course.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone has to change, then
it's the men
who come from cultures where
women are traditionally

23:41.287 --> 23:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robbed of their rights, where
they are repressed
and the victims of violence.
These men have

23:46.058 --> 23:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been brutalized by the violence
and trauma
of war. They have problems, and
I don't want

23:50.095 --> 23:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us to have problems because of
that. They
have to change and recognize the
values and

23:54.600 --> 23:56.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
laws of our states
unconditionally.

23:56.435 --> 24:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Parts of this
city have been
described as being as no-go
zones for women,

24:01.473 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but some have been out on the
streets demanding
that they should be free to move
where they

24:05.344 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wish without fear of being
attacked. They
demanded action from Chancellor
Angela Merkel,

24:10.382 --> 24:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who gave her first reaction to
the events
in Cologne and elsewhere.

24:14.153 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): What happened at
New Year is

24:19.158 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely unacceptable. Those
are despicable
criminal acts which a state will
not accept,

24:24.129 --> 24:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Germany. That's why an
intensive
investigation by the relevant
institutions

24:28.567 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is under way. This investigation
must be supported.

24:32.338 --> 24:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The feeling women had in this
case of being
completely defenseless and at
mercy is, for

24:36.942 --> 24:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, personally intolerable, and
so it is important
that everything that happened
must come out

24:41.280 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the open. It's right and
it's good that
there are a lot of police
reports being filed.

24:46.018 --> 24:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These two young
Germans,
both with immigrant backgrounds,
are deeply

24:50.622 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troubled by what happened. The
man with the
glasses, Mimoun Berrissoun,
whose parents

24:55.461 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are from Morocco, heads a group
dedicated
to deradicalizing young Muslims
and promoting

25:00.866 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integration.

25:02.735 --> 25:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIMOUN BERRISSOUN, Turn 180
Degrees (through
translator): When groups of
people from other

25:07.706 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries come here, the first
thing they
have to do is learn the rules.
They have to

25:11.944 --> 25:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
develop a sense of what they can
and can't
do.

25:15.180 --> 25:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's possible they had the idea
in their heads
that it would be easier to get
with European

25:19.651 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women than it actually is, and
that they had
brought this idea with them from
home, and

25:24.723 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to make it reality here.
But I also
believe this is a very small
group of people

25:29.194 --> 25:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who behaved this way in that
moment.

25:31.997 --> 25:39.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Talha Evran,
who is of Turkish
ancestry, is worried about the
impact these

25:39.304 --> 25:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks will have on immigrants
who abide
by German laws.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALHA EVRAN, Germany: The right
wing is going
to use that as a big argument.
They have been

25:45.911 --> 25:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waiting for that. And that is so
sad, because
there is big issue, this
conversation, this

25:50.916 --> 25:52.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discussion.

25:52.785 --> 25:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we Germans are trying to
talk good about
them. Like, we're trying to
welcome refugees.

25:59.958 --> 26:07.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if there are people
harassing people on
New Year's Eve being asylum
seekers or refugees,

26:07.065 --> 26:13.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, that's just
endangering all of that
welcoming, welcome culture.
That's what we

26:13.205 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
call it.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Tonight,
outside the scene
of the New Year's Eve assaults,
the right-wing

26:18.410 --> 26:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group known as Alternative for
Germany was
out canvassing for support.
Their polling

26:22.848 --> 26:24.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
numbers are on the rise.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Supporter Helmut Vanichek:

26:26.452 --> 26:31.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HELMUT VANICHEK, Germany
(through translator):
Those guilty of crimes, but also
those whose

26:31.123 --> 26:35.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
asylum applications are
rejected, must leave
the country, in accordance with
German law.

26:35.994 --> 26:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: When the scale
of the attacks
first emerged, senior government
officials

26:40.466 --> 26:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were at pains to separate the
issue of the
refugee crisis from the criminal
activity.

26:45.971 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now the German authorities
say they are
18 asylum seekers among the 31
people suspected

26:51.977 --> 26:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of involvement in the troubles
on New Year's
Eve. Some of those people could
be deported

26:56.882 --> 26:58.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if convicted.

26:58.717 --> 27:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the perceived lack of
control has
led to Cologne's police chief
being relieved

27:02.955 --> 27:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his duties. The officers
union believes
that he's been made a scapegoat,
claiming

27:07.292 --> 27:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that government policies have
undermined their
ability to police properly.

27:11.697 --> 27:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Cologne.

JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 100,000
people turned
out for the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las

27:35.387 --> 27:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vegas this week, the annual
showcase for the
latest in technology, devices
and high-end

27:42.060 --> 27:43.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toys.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the big themes was the
rising interest
in health tech.

27:46.331 --> 27:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
was there to explore the
potential benefits

27:50.802 --> 27:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and caveats around all of this.

27:53.639 --> 27:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His report is part of our
Breakthroughs series
on invention and innovation.

27:58.176 --> 28:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wearing your
heart on your
sleeve is taking on a whole new
meaning.

28:04.082 --> 28:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the 2016 pilgrimage to Las
Vegas for gadget
geeks, CES, wearable health
tracking devices

28:11.757 --> 28:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broke into full stride, winning
much more
than a bit of flashy floor space
and heated

28:18.063 --> 28:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hype. Of course, for the growing
legions of
you keeping score at home on
your devices,

28:23.669 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is likely old data.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL, Chief Business
Officer, Fitbit:
What is happening is, people are
taking more

28:27.239 --> 28:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility for their health
and fitness.
They're realizing that health
and fitness

28:29.074 --> 28:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't just popping a pill. It's
actually what
they do that can really add up
to a healthy

28:35.447 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

28:37.282 --> 28:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Woody Scal is the
chief business
officer at market leader Fitbit,
a $4 billion

28:42.721 --> 28:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company based in San Francisco
that began
selling glorified pedometers in
2007.

28:47.859 --> 28:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL: Seven years ago,
when you talked
about fitness electronics,
people thought

28:53.298 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about products for triathletes.
They didn't
realize that these products
could really address

28:55.901 --> 28:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the needs of everyday people.

28:59.071 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: An estimated 500
million people
worldwide apparently now feel
the need to

29:04.276 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
copiously log their steps,
leaps, strokes
and spins, while recording their
breathing,

29:09.948 --> 29:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart rate, blood pressure,
sleep patterns
and food intake, just to name a
few, and then,

29:16.021 --> 29:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of course, brag about it online.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE, Editor in
Chief, CNET:
I think humans have always been
completely

29:20.492 --> 29:25.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narcissistic. That has not
changed. The technology
has given us a constant virtual
mirror.

29:25.864 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lindsey
Turrentine is a sporadic
fitness logger and the editor in
chief of

29:31.169 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNET.com, where tracking the
technology of
fitness tracking has become a
big, important

29:37.442 --> 29:39.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beat.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE: We're always
checking
on ourselves constantly. We're
checking on

29:40.979 --> 29:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether people have responded to
us, and then
we're also checking to see
whether our bodies

29:45.584 --> 29:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have responded to what we're
doing. It's just
another way to look at
ourselves.

29:48.587 --> 29:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But there is more
than the
psychology of self-obsession
driving this

29:52.724 --> 29:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sector to grow more than 200
percent a year.
There's a perfect storm of
technological advances

29:58.964 --> 30:05.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. Sensors are rapidly
shrinking in
size and cost. Communications
between devices

30:05.470 --> 30:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has improved. And so has battery
life.

30:08.507 --> 30:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, none of it could
happen without
the ubiquity of smartphones, our
mobile switchboard

30:14.780 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all things technological.
It's a ripe
convergence for the big players
upstairs and

30:21.586 --> 30:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the upstarts in the basement as
well.

30:23.689 --> 30:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where we found Peter
Neilson, CEO of
a Denver start-up called
femtoScale.

30:29.695 --> 30:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems like there's no limit
to the amount
of data people want to get.
Right? Would you

30:33.398 --> 30:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agree with that? What's going
on?

30:34.499 --> 30:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NEILSON, CEO, femtoScale:
And wearables...

30:36.001 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEILSON: ... are blowing
up. That's
half of CES this year looks like
its wearable,

30:40.472 --> 30:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to compute everything.

30:42.274 --> 30:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Neilson's company
is developing
a portable and eventually
wearable sensor

30:46.378 --> 30:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can provide real-time
readings of air
quality by weighing airborne
particles much

30:51.683 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too small to see. The scale is
just barely
visible.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I needed a jeweler's magnifying
glass to see
it.

30:58.323 --> 31:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEILSON: What we're really
trying to
do is look at, not just health
care, but wellness.

31:05.097 --> 31:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we use all this data we can
get from all
sorts of different things, not
only to keep

31:09.201 --> 31:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people healthy once they're in
the hospital,
but prevent them from getting
sick in the

31:13.805 --> 31:15.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place?

31:15.640 --> 31:20.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: San Jose-based
Stratio has
shrunk a spectrometer down to
palm size. The

31:20.212 --> 31:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
device shines a bright light on
food and medicine
to determine if they are what
they purport

31:24.950 --> 31:26.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

31:26.818 --> 31:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this demonstration, CEO Jae
Hyung Lee compared
counterfeit, generic and genuine
Viagra to

31:33.024 --> 31:38.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the fingerprint-like
spectroscopic pattern
of the real McCoy. It was
instantly obvious

31:38.730 --> 31:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which were the impostors.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAE HYUNG LEE, CEO, Stratio: So
far, people
were just interested themselves,
but now they

31:43.135 --> 31:46.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to know more about what
they're eating.
They want to know what they're
buying. They

31:46.738 --> 31:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to know what's going on
around them.

31:48.740 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Clearly, exercise
and nutrition
tracking alone are not enough to
satisfy entrepreneurs

31:53.712 --> 31:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or consumers in the health
tracking space.

31:56.715 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kaustubh Kale is CEO of a Boca
Raton start-up
called AventuSoft. They are
developing a wearable

32:03.955 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heart monitor and
electrocardiogram.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAUSTUBH KALE, CEO, AventuSoft:
There's not
a pushback anymore. People are
already aware

32:07.726 --> 32:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Fitbit or any of the other
wearables, so
they're already accepting these
new technologies.

32:09.528 --> 32:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, as the technology
improves, you can
now push it into the medical
grid domain.

32:20.172 --> 32:26.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's an
interesting development.
When you think about it, it
really is no less

32:26.244 --> 32:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the democratization of
medicine, isn't
it?

32:28.680 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAUSTUBH KALE: Absolutely, yes.
You're putting
the power in the consumer's
hands, and so

32:32.851 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can get the data whenever
they need,
where they need it and with the
accuracy that

32:37.923 --> 32:39.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the doctor needs.

32:39.691 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is where the
government
steps in. In early 2015, the
Food and Drug

32:43.695 --> 32:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration released a
document offering
guidance to industry and its own
staff on

32:48.667 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulating mobile medical
applications, declaring
it will only regulate apps that
are medical

32:54.239 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices and whose functionality
could pose
a risk to a patient's safety if
the mobile

33:00.011 --> 33:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
app were to not function as
intended.

33:01.880 --> 33:06.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAKUL PATEL, Food and Drug
Administration:
So, the risk to patients ranges
from misdiagnosis,

33:06.117 --> 33:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delay in diagnosis, or when you
get into the
discussion of false positives
and false negatives,

33:11.923 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then you have therapeutic
devices that
can actually harm people.

33:16.261 --> 33:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bakul Patel is
associate center
director for digital health at
FDA.

33:21.867 --> 33:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAKUL PATEL: There are standards
of what an
EKG machine -- how it should
capture, what

33:25.871 --> 33:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of wave forms, how it
should be managing
the signals that comes out of
your body and

33:30.508 --> 33:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
displaying it. Those are all
standards written
-- written for that.

33:33.745 --> 33:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're going to be in the
market as an
EKG machine, doctors better rely
on them,

33:37.849 --> 33:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we ask for testing to
happen, so they
can actually make the same sort
of diagnosis

33:42.320 --> 33:44.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and treatment decisions.

33:44.189 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The pull of
diagnostic tools
out of the doctor's toolbox and
into our pockets,

33:50.295 --> 33:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our ears and onto our wrists is
a revolution
seed in part by this man, Larry
Smarr.

33:56.568 --> 34:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A scientist and professor at the
University
of California, San Diego, he
used the video

34:01.506 --> 34:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall at the school's Qualcomm
Institute to
illustrate the power of what's
called the

34:06.811 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quantified self.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SMARR, University of
California, San
Diego: Big data, as it's called.
And this

34:10.916 --> 34:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is about me. Every one of the
points on these
graphs are a different blood
test or a stool

34:18.256 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test in which I got a data point
over a decade.

34:22.861 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Smarr began
his fantastic
data voyage back in 2000 with a
desire to

34:29.367 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lose some weight. And so his
self-prescribed
testing began. He never looked
back, and,

34:35.807 --> 34:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before long, he spotted trouble.
His self-diagnosis,
Crohn's disease.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he brought the data to his
doctor, who
said:

34:44.416 --> 34:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SMARR: If you don't have
symptoms, why
are you here? I said, because I
got data.

34:48.987 --> 34:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, well, that's not
helpful. And
so I realized, as a lifetime
scientist, that

34:57.195 --> 35:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the practice of medicine and the
practice
of science, while they overlap
sometimes,

35:03.835 --> 35:05.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are generally different.

35:05.704 --> 35:10.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, he fired that
doctor and
found another. Indeed, so many
people generating

35:10.608 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much diagnostic data may
sound like a prescription
for a lot of bad diagnoses,
unneeded anxiety

35:17.515 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or even an epidemic of
hypochondria.

35:19.584 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE: There is
such a thing
as too much data if you can't
deal with the

35:24.422 --> 35:26.224 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
data.

35:26.257 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't have software that
will help
you interpret the data in a
smart and reliable

35:29.194 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, or if you get overwhelmed
and frustrated
and you don't know how to pick
it out of the

35:34.933 --> 35:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big needle in a haystack sort of
data pile
that's building up on your
phone, then it's

35:39.504 --> 35:42.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too much data. But it's sort of
up to you
and how much you can handle.

MILES O'BRIEN: But a giant cloud
of real-time
data, really big data,
aggregated, analyzed

35:48.279 --> 35:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and compared with artificial
intelligence,
could lead to stunning
breakthroughs in preventive

35:53.785 --> 35:55.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
medicine.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL: Where you can figure
out, how
has this kind of signal been
correlated with

35:57.956 --> 35:57.956 align:left position:0%,start line:60% size:100%
other things that have happened
among a
broader set of people. Someday,
could you
get an early alert about an
impending heart

36:07.198 --> 36:11.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
event? Yes, I believe you can. I
believe you
will.

36:11.603 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: There may be
rough spots and
silliness along the way, but
there is no stopping

36:17.142 --> 36:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the free market experiment to
give us all
more knowledge and more power
managing our

36:22.781 --> 36:25.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own well-being.

Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Las Vegas.

36:36.428 --> 36:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a rare
Q&amp;A: the president
of the United States face to
face with concerned

36:48.540 --> 36:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens during a CNN town hall
Thursday night,
the topic, gun safety and gun
rights.

36:55.547 --> 37:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama made the case
for the executive
actions he announced earlier
this week, saying

37:00.885 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his proposals balance the need
to prevent
gun deaths with the
Constitution's right to

37:06.091 --> 37:07.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bear arms.

37:07.892 --> 37:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I respect the Second Amendment,
I respect

37:11.329 --> 37:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right to bear arms. I
respect people who
want a gun for self-protection,
for hunting,

37:19.370 --> 37:21.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sportsmanship.

37:21.840 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all of us can agree that it
makes sense
to do everything we can to keep
guns out of

37:30.949 --> 37:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hands of people who would
try to do others
harm or to do themselves harm.

37:35.954 --> 37:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier in the
day, House Speaker
Paul Ryan wrote off the
president as someone

37:42.060 --> 37:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who put too much emphasis on
limiting access
to guns, at the expense of
Second Amendment

37:47.499 --> 37:49.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I don't think the president -- I
think he's

37:52.137 --> 37:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been pretty hostile to the
Second Amendment
all along.

37:54.672 --> 38:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think the president has
a lot of respect
for the Second Amendment. And
guess what is

38:01.880 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the most important things
that we can
do as citizens, collectively, to
protect ourselves

38:06.784 --> 38:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from some possible terrorist
attack? Exercising
our Second Amendment rights.

38:10.121 --> 38:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Brooks and Corn. That's New
York Times

38:14.826 --> 38:20.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
columnist David Brooks, and
David Corn, Washington
bureau chief for "Mother Jones"
and an analyst

38:20.431 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for MSNBC. Mark Shields is away
this week.

38:23.701 --> 38:24.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We welcome you both.

38:24.435 --> 38:25.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: Thank you.

38:25.436 --> 38:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen.

38:27.338 --> 38:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, David Brooks, who is right?
Does the president
respect the Second Amendment or
doesn't he?

38:31.176 --> 38:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have got to side
with Obama
on this one.

38:34.445 --> 38:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He -- the Second Amendment
guarantees guns,
some possession. It doesn't
guarantee all

38:40.518 --> 38:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns. It doesn't guarantee a
freedom from
background checks. It doesn't
mean you can't

38:45.156 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regulate them in some way.

38:47.091 --> 38:52.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think he's been
reasonably respectful
toward the Second Amendment. I
personally

38:52.497 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
support most of what he
proposed. Do I think
it will do a lot of good?
Probably not. The

38:57.802 --> 39:02.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
history of gun control
legislation from the
Brady Bill, backwards and
forwards, has been

39:02.106 --> 39:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it can reduce suicides, but
it doesn't
seem to have a huge effect on
homicide rates.

39:06.978 --> 39:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the effect of what the
president proposes
is, I think, minimal, but
probably a positive

39:12.283 --> 39:16.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
small step in the right
direction. And it
boggles the mind to think it
would be in violation

39:16.888 --> 39:18.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Constitution.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Corn, what
about this?
Is Ryan right or is the
president?

39:20.858 --> 39:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Paul Ryan was doing
sort of a
mild version of what the
Republican conservative

39:26.097 --> 39:31.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line has been, which is really
to be sort
of, I think, demagogic when
talking about

39:31.536 --> 39:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, that he wants
to take guns
away.

39:34.872 --> 39:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just earlier in the week, Marco
Rubio put
out a campaign ad saying that
the president

39:38.576 --> 39:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to take your guns. And
that's been the
line from the NRA Over and over
again. And

39:44.115 --> 39:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's really not true. He can't.
And there's
nothing that he's proposed that
would take

39:48.786 --> 39:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guns away from people who
actually possess
them already.

39:52.457 --> 39:56.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think the very
interesting thing
about the town hall meeting was
that the president

39:56.894 --> 40:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took that on directly. And he
said, there
are conspiracy theories out
there about me,

40:01.899 --> 40:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I want to confront them. And
he wondered
why the NRA wasn't there last
night, because

40:06.371 --> 40:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they had been invited to come.

40:08.139 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason was because
he was ready
to really call them out on that
point, and

40:12.610 --> 40:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't want to have that
honest disagreement
with the president.

40:17.348 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, is
there any
movement on this issue? Are we
just frozen,

40:22.887 --> 40:24.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with each side standing its
ground?

40:24.489 --> 40:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Mm-hmm, frozen.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:26.958 --> 40:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You know, it's
become a cultural
issue.

40:28.993 --> 40:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, I thought Obama
is trying to
begin to defuse that, but it is
just a fact

40:33.464 --> 40:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a lot of people, especially
in rural
parts of the country, think that
gun control

40:37.168 --> 40:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a symbol for, we don't like
your lifestyle.
And they feel outsiders are
dictating to them

40:42.307 --> 40:44.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their lifestyle.

40:44.142 --> 40:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even non-gun owners in
rural parts
of Virginia or wherever perceive
it as hostile

40:49.747 --> 40:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elitism. And I think that's how
it's frozen.
That's why it's frozen.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: It's interesting,
because that
wasn't always the case.

40:56.187 --> 41:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in 1994, Reagan urged
banning the making
of AK-47s and assault weapons.
Chris Christie

41:03.094 --> 41:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says that he got into politics
in the early
'90s because he wanted to do
something about

41:07.231 --> 41:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns. Even Marco Rubio, when he
ran in 2000,
said he was for reasonable
restrictions.

41:11.903 --> 41:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there used to be this
ability for Democrats
and some Republicans to talk
about this stuff.

41:17.875 --> 41:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Republican Party, it has
just moved
so far to the right, I think
goaded by the

41:22.647 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NRA, that there really is no
room to talk
about this without it becoming
sort of caricatures.

41:28.519 --> 41:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there is also
conversation
in the Democratic Party. The
president also,

41:33.157 --> 41:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks, wrote an op-ed
piece for The
New York -- in your newspaper
today, in which,

41:37.495 --> 41:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among other things, he made some
of the same
arguments that he did last night
in that town

41:41.366 --> 41:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hall, but he also said: I won't
support a
candidate, even one in my own
party, who isn't

41:46.971 --> 41:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to go along with gun
reform, with
significant -- some people
looked at that

41:50.975 --> 41:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a shot at Bernie Sanders.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, Sanders
has got a
lot of wiggle room. And the
president left

41:55.313 --> 41:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself some wiggle room.

41:56.981 --> 41:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Sanders is the nominee, I
guarantee you
Barack Obama will be there for
him.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID CORN: Yes.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And then the other
-- if there
are any other Democrats, they
probably come

42:03.488 --> 42:06.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from red states and they
wouldn't want Barack
Obama campaigning for them
anyway.

42:06.891 --> 42:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to me, that was a sentence
without much
meaning.

42:08.793 --> 42:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But -- and in
reaction to that,
evidently, or at least because
of it, David

42:14.832 --> 42:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corn, you had Hillary Clinton's
campaign today
pointing out that what -- some
of the past

42:21.305 --> 42:22.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
votes of Bernie Sanders.

42:22.940 --> 42:23.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that all about?

42:23.775 --> 42:25.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:25.643 --> 42:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, you know, the
rap on Hillary
Clinton within the Democratic
Party has always

42:29.080 --> 42:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been that she's not progressive
enough.

42:31.549 --> 42:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders, obviously,
on issues of
the economy, and financial
reform, and in

42:37.121 --> 42:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy, is to her left,
and probably
more in line with a lot of
people, the Democratic

42:42.527 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primary voters.

42:44.395 --> 42:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, guns is one place where
there is a little
distance. There is not a great
difference,

42:50.168 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there is some distance. You
look at some
past votes where she is more
progressive than

42:54.705 --> 42:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders. And so any
chance the Hillary
Clinton campaign has to make
something out

42:59.510 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that, they did.

43:01.312 --> 43:06.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they leaped upon the Obama
op-ed today
to point out, well, maybe he
won't campaign

43:06.818 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, just -- at least to
suggest that,
which I don't think is a
possibility.

43:10.988 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is that
something that
makes a difference in Iowa or
New Hampshire,

43:15.026 --> 43:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which are coming up in a few
weeks?

43:16.494 --> 43:17.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: I don't think...

43:19.163 --> 43:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: There's only one
small group
of people who vote on the gun
issue. And that's

43:21.732 --> 43:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NRA. Nobody else votes on
the gun issue
in this country, which is why
it's hard to

43:25.169 --> 43:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pass gun control legislation.

43:26.971 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
ask you about
-- there is more to talk about,
about the

43:31.108 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the Republican side,
you're seeing
-- yes, you saw this
Clinton-Sanders back

43:35.746 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and forth, but, on the
Republican side, among
-- David Brooks, among the
so-called establishment

43:40.785 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, they're taking more
potshots
at one another.

43:44.922 --> 43:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're hearing a lot of back and
forth between
Rubio and Cruz, between Rubio
and Christie.

43:50.194 --> 43:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's going on over there,
or is anybody
making any headway among that
group?

43:54.765 --> 43:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, Ted Cruz is
making headway.

43:57.201 --> 44:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's -- you begin to see
little signs of
liftoff. Trump has sort of
ceiling-ed out.

44:02.840 --> 44:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carson is collapsing. And Cruz
is somehow
beginning to get some momentum
from Iowa and

44:07.178 --> 44:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elsewhere. And so people are
either mimicking
him, which Rubio is doing a
little by adopting

44:11.182 --> 44:16.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the dark and satanic
tones that Cruz
has, and so...

44:16.420 --> 44:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you --
let me just
ask, what did you just say?

44:18.489 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:20.324 --> 44:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, if you go to
a Cruz -- if
you watch a Cruz speech, it's
like, we have

44:22.426 --> 44:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got this enemy, we have got that
enemy, we're
going to stomp on this person,
we're going

44:25.196 --> 44:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to crush that person, we're
going to destroy
that person.

44:27.899 --> 44:34.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an ugly world in Ted
Cruz's world. And
it's combative. And it's angry,
and it's apocalyptic.

44:34.205 --> 44:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, actually, if
you go to a
speech from his dad, who is a
pastor, evangelical,

44:39.710 --> 44:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rafael Cruz, it actually is
satanic.

44:41.712 --> 44:43.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:43.548 --> 44:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: He -- I watched a
speech in which
he said Satan was behind the
Supreme Court

44:45.550 --> 44:47.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision to legalize gay
marriage.

44:47.585 --> 44:48.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, it's not...

44:48.920 --> 44:50.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: OK. Well, I
withdraw the satanic
from Ted Cruz.

44:50.488 --> 44:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: You're thinking that
it's political,
but, sometimes, it's literal.

44:52.623 --> 44:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Mephistophelian,
maybe.

44:53.791 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:55.560 --> 45:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But it's dark and
combative,
and, frankly, harsh. It's a
harsh -- he gets

45:01.165 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some jokes in the beginning, but
then it's
just, we have enemies. We're in
an apocalyptic

45:03.868 --> 45:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation. We're on the edge of
the abyss.
You need a tough guy to beat
that back.

45:09.840 --> 45:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's his personality.
That's not Marco
Rubio's personality. He's a
sunny -- he's

45:14.645 --> 45:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been running the youthful
optimism campaign,
but he's beginning, to prevent
Cruz from getting

45:19.951 --> 45:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liftoff, to mimic sort of that,
get a piece
of that.

45:22.620 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally think it's a
mistake, because
inauthentic -- inauthenticity
almost never

45:27.892 --> 45:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
works. And so, if Cruz starts to
go like -- I
mean, if Rubio starts to go like
Cruz, he

45:32.863 --> 45:34.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just doesn't look like himself,
and that bothers
people.

45:34.966 --> 45:39.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: I think the
interesting dynamic
is, a few months ago, the
conventional wisdom,

45:39.103 --> 45:42.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has been wrong at every
turn of this
campaign, was that Trump would
kind of fade

45:42.773 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the beginning of the voting,
and there
would be a couple different
spots for people

45:46.777 --> 45:48.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to land in.

45:48.613 --> 45:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, Trump hasn't
faded. Cruz has
sort of moved up, but he is not
an establishment

45:53.217 --> 45:57.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. So that has left the
so-called
establishment candidates,
whether it's Rubio,

45:57.688 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kasich, Christie, whoever you
put in that
group, fighting for third place.

46:02.293 --> 46:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the desperation
level has just
really amped up. And I see them
all as, like,

46:07.498 --> 46:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guys in a pool treading water
and trying to
splash water in the face of the
others, because

46:12.370 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're so desperate not to be
cut out...

46:14.105 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:15.940 --> 46:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: ... because Cruz and
Trump seem
to have a lock, at least in
Iowa, on the first

46:19.410 --> 46:20.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two positions.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, in New
Hampshire, it seems
to me there's more room to play.

46:23.414 --> 46:24.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID CORN: Yes.

46:25.016 --> 46:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To keep the water
analogy,
rather than the satanic analogy
there.

46:28.052 --> 46:28.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:28.719 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: I think so, too.

46:30.621 --> 46:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they kind of all seemed to
make a decision
in December that they had to do
-- they had

46:36.994 --> 46:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have some sort of a showing
in Iowa, because
there just isn't enough room for
The train

46:42.233 --> 46:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of Manchester at the end of
that...

46:44.101 --> 46:45.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:45.770 --> 46:46.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is any one of
them -- you
mentioned Christie, Kasich,
Rubio.

46:46.404 --> 46:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Oh, Jeb Bush.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:48.305 --> 46:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You didn't --
neither one of
you has mentioned Jeb Bush.

46:51.208 --> 46:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Oh, yes. There is
this guy named
Jeb Bush, yes.

46:53.077 --> 46:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is any one of
them making headway,
the kind of headway that could
last for a

46:56.681 --> 46:57.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few weeks?

46:58.015 --> 47:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, no one seems
to be having
a breakout moment.

47:00.851 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christie has been moving up a
little bit,
only in New Hampshire. Rubio has
had a little

47:05.923 --> 47:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of burst and then kind of
leveled out.
So, maybe we will be surprised
the first week

47:11.662 --> 47:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in February in New Hampshire,
but, so far,
I don't see anybody coming out
of the pack

47:17.334 --> 47:17.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

47:19.704 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I still think it will be a
Cruz-Rubio
thing by the end of the first
two. But then

47:26.210 --> 47:31.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you go down South, and Cruz has
some natural
turf to run there. And so he
just has a straighter

47:31.148 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line to the nomination.

47:32.783 --> 47:38.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I personally think his
personality is not
ideal for a candidate in
likability.

47:38.389 --> 47:39.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean Cruz.

47:39.824 --> 47:42.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But -- I'm trying
to compensate
for my past crudeness.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cruz, yes, yes.

47:44.528 --> 47:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so -- but he
-- if you look
now, I still think he's the guy
with the straightest

47:48.165 --> 47:50.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line to the nomination.

47:50.067 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you don't --
you -- specifically,
you have mentioned Rubio a few
times. You

47:52.136 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't see Christie? You don't
see Kasich,
Bush?

47:54.305 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Christie is
like -- he's
like what McCain did in '08. He
just sits

47:58.843 --> 48:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, and has town hall after
town hall in
New Hampshire.

48:02.113 --> 48:08.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, like McCain, he's a genius
at formulation.
He's great at riffling. And so
it's working

48:08.385 --> 48:12.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him. So, he's coming up. And
you begin
to see people taking shots at
Christie. But

48:12.323 --> 48:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not acceptable to all parts
of the party.

48:15.159 --> 48:19.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz -- Rubio is acceptable to
all parts of
the party, which makes him the
most viable

48:19.430 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alternative.

48:21.232 --> 48:25.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: Well, not on
immigration, though.
That is still a very big
liability for Rubio.

48:25.836 --> 48:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eventually, he has to get votes
from the Republican
base. The Republican base hates
anything to

48:31.375 --> 48:36.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with immigration reform. And
he has tried
to run away from that. But if he
gets closer,

48:36.413 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other people will remind the
base of where
he used to be.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I differ on
that.

48:40.718 --> 48:43.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who stand up at these
meetings,
they tend to not have any
tolerance for what

48:43.621 --> 48:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio did a couple years ago.
But if you poll
Republican primary voters, there
are some

48:48.659 --> 48:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls where a majority favor
some sort of
path to citizenship. So, among
the actual

48:53.030 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, the silent majority,
there is a lot
more flexibility than you would
think if you

48:56.634 --> 48:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just listen to the questions at
the town halls.

48:58.569 --> 49:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You get the sense
Republican
primary voters may be
struggling, those who

49:02.940 --> 49:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
haven't decided yet may be
struggling still
about what to do.

49:06.677 --> 49:14.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health care reform law, ACA,
the Republicans
in the House finally got enough
votes, David

49:14.819 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, week. The Senate had
already passed
repeal. Now the House has. They
got it to

49:19.990 --> 49:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's desk. Now, he's
vetoed it.

49:22.426 --> 49:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Paul Ryan, we hear him
saying today, we're
going to -- this isn't the last
you heard

49:27.097 --> 49:28.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

49:28.699 --> 49:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is the ACA in real jeopardy
here?

49:30.701 --> 49:32.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No. No.

49:32.469 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if a Republican wins, it's
entrenched.
The systemic disruption that
would caused

49:37.842 --> 49:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by simply getting rid of it
would be catastrophic
for a lot of companies and a lot
of actual

49:42.980 --> 49:45.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are actually doing
stuff on the
ground.

49:45.149 --> 49:48.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a Republican got in, it would
change a
lot. But, frankly, if a Democrat
gets in,

49:48.953 --> 49:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is going to change a lot.
Some of the really
startling premium hikes that
we're seeing

49:54.024 --> 49:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some of the insurance
companies are going
to cause huge problems down the
road.

49:57.561 --> 50:01.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even if a Democrat gets in,
there's going
to have to be some changes. But
it's very

50:01.332 --> 50:05.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard to see you just -- just
uprooting it?
It's too deeply entrenched.

50:05.870 --> 50:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see?

50:07.638 --> 50:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: It wasn't even
repealed. They
repealed the part of the law
that requires

50:12.476 --> 50:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to have insurance, but
they kept in
the stuff that's popular, which
is, if you

50:16.680 --> 50:20.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have preexisting conditions, you
can get coverage.
Anyone can get coverage.

50:20.150 --> 50:26.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem is, if you take
away the requirement,
and you just leave the ability
of people with

50:26.991 --> 50:30.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
preexisting conditions to get
coverage, then
premiums truly skyrocket.

50:30.794 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they were doing, they
were voting
for a way to create a death
spiral without

50:35.499 --> 50:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replacing it with anything. So
they don't
want this bill to pass. And, if
you look at

50:39.970 --> 50:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in Kentucky, a good case
study, where a
Tea Party candidate won saying
he would repeal

50:45.676 --> 50:48.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obamacare, Bevin, he became
governor.

50:48.479 --> 50:53.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in between New Year's Day
and Christmas,
he very quietly said he wasn't
going to get

50:53.484 --> 50:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rid of the Medicaid expansion
that he promised
to, because it's working in
Kentucky.

JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
that's a
model for what is -- a
forerunner of what's

51:02.159 --> 51:03.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening in Washington?

51:04.028 --> 51:07.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Yes, I don't --
listen, they can't
get rid of it without tremendous
dislocation

51:07.831 --> 51:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to real people. They will pay a
real political
cost.

51:11.068 --> 51:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they haven't suggested an
alternative.
So I think it was just all
showmanship. And

51:15.272 --> 51:21.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was kind of funny that Paul
Ryan was saying,
look what we have accomplished
today.

51:21.512 --> 51:24.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
leave it there
with what we accomplished here.

the increasing numbers of women
who are pregnant

and addicted to painkillers, a

52:38.088 --> 52:43.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

all you can
think about is getting that
drug, getting

52:43.260 --> 52:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that medicine, getting that
relief.

52:45.729 --> 52:50.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

legitimate prescription
for pain following a car

52:50.667 --> 52:52.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
slipped into abuse.

52:55.305 --> 52:59.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days before my prescription was
supposed to
be gone. And then I found ways
to get them

52:59.977 --> 53:00.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
without a prescription.
