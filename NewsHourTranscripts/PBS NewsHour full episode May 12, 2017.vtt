JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.774 --> 00:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
White House
refuses to say whether it
records conversations,

00:12.679 --> 00:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as President Trump keeps up his
battle with
fired FBI Director James Comey
by warning

00:18.918 --> 00:20.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him not to talk.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then: one-on-one with
Condoleezza Rice.

00:24.157 --> 00:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sit down with the former
secretary of state
to discuss the Russia
investigation, democracy

00:30.697 --> 00:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Trump White House.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE, Former U.S.
Secretary of
State: Judy, I worry that this
is starting

00:34.534 --> 00:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to erode people's confidence in
our institutions.

00:37.937 --> 00:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: In a
reversal of Obama-era
policies, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions orders

00:44.778 --> 00:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal prosecutors to pursue
harsher sentences
on drug offenses, including
mandatory minimum

00:51.785 --> 00:53.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time in prison.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:55.688 --> 01:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and Ramesh Ponnuru
are here to
analyze a watershed week for the
Trump administration.

01:01.761 --> 01:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.568 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.304 --> 01:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're 113 days
into the Trump
presidency, with more than 1,300
left until

01:22.682 --> 01:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the next Inauguration Day.

01:24.751 --> 01:29.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At times, it's felt like a
whirlwind, and
this week may have brought the
most tumultuous

01:29.622 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins brings us up
to speed.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House
Press Secretary: And now I will
take your

01:34.994 --> 01:36.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A roller-coast
week for the
White House ended with more
turbulence and

01:39.632 --> 01:41.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Does he think it's
appropriate to
threaten someone like Mr. Comey?

01:43.002 --> 01:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: After reports
that allies
of fired FBI Director James
Comey insist he

01:47.774 --> 01:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never told President Trump that
he wasn't
under investigation, the
opposite of the president's

01:53.379 --> 01:55.148 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
version.

01:55.181 --> 01:58.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This morning, a tweeting
President Trump fired
out: "Comey better hope that
there are no

01:58.451 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tapes of our conversations."

02:00.887 --> 02:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House, reporters
asked Press
Secretary Sean Spicer if that
was meant as

02:04.824 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a message.

02:06.192 --> 02:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
That is not a threat.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's simply stated a fact.

02:08.595 --> 02:12.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Asked
repeatedly if there
are recording devices in the
Oval Office,

02:12.198 --> 02:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Spicer refused to answer.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: The president has
nothing further
to add on that.

02:15.869 --> 02:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The back and
forth and back
again this week has been
dizzying.

02:20.039 --> 02:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may clear things up to look
at the two
core issues: Why was Director
Comey fired,

02:25.445 --> 02:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and when was that decision made?

02:27.514 --> 02:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, why -- here's what the
president said
yesterday to NBC News.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
When I decided to just do it, I
said to myself,

02:35.021 --> 02:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, you know, this Russia
thing with Trump
and Russia is a made-up story.

02:40.827 --> 02:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an excuse by the Democrats
for having
lost an election that they
should have won.

02:45.465 --> 02:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But just one
day earlier,
Wednesday, Vice President Pence
told reporters

02:50.336 --> 02:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the issues were a lack of
confidence and recommendations
from the Justice Department.

02:54.474 --> 02:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The American people have to have
confidence

02:58.077 --> 03:01.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

03:01.047 --> 03:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because of the actions that
the deputy
attorney general outlined to the
president

03:06.019 --> 03:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were endorsed and agreed
with by the
attorney general, the president
made the right

03:11.191 --> 03:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decision at the right time.

03:13.059 --> 03:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Pence was
referencing Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

03:17.363 --> 03:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His letter released Tuesday
centered on charges
that Comey mishandled the
Clinton investigation,

03:23.303 --> 03:25.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing about Russia.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other rationale for Comey's
firing -- it
was in the president's letter to
Comey -- restoring

03:29.375 --> 03:35.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust and confidence in the FBI,
but that
was directly countered yesterday
by acting

03:35.248 --> 03:36.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FBI Chief Andrew McCabe.

03:37.016 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW MCCABE, Acting FBI
Director: I can
tell you also that Director
Comey enjoyed

03:41.187 --> 03:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broad support within the FBI and
still does
to this day.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At different
times, the White
House pointed to three different
reasons for

03:49.929 --> 03:51.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Comey firing.

03:51.464 --> 03:55.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There were also varying
descriptions of when
and how that decision was made.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's the president in
yesterday's NBC interview.

03:57.770 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I was going to
fire Comey, my
decision.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was going to fire, regardless
of recommendation.

04:04.177 --> 04:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That is at odds
with the
previous two days of staff
statements.

04:08.648 --> 04:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Press Secretary Spicer
speaking off-camera
minutes after the Comey firing
told reporters

04:14.554 --> 04:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a DOJ decision made by no
one at the
White House.

04:18.725 --> 04:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wednesday, Vice President Pence
pointed seven
times to the Justice Department
recommendation.

04:23.763 --> 04:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: President Trump made
the right
decision at the right time, and
to accept

04:29.836 --> 04:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recommendation of the deputy
attorney
general and the attorney
general, to ask for

04:36.175 --> 04:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the termination, to support the
termination
of the director of the FBI.

04:41.381 --> 04:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Same day, White
House spokeswoman
Sarah Huckabee Sanders implied
the Justice

04:45.852 --> 04:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Department initiated the idea to
fire Comey.

04:48.755 --> 04:55.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: He did
have a conversation
with the deputy attorney general
on Monday,

04:55.295 --> 04:59.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they had come to him to
express their
concerns.

04:59.299 --> 05:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But one day
later, a change:
Sanders said the president had
told her he

05:04.370 --> 05:06.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decided earlier.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: I went
off of the
information that I had when I
answered your

05:09.175 --> 05:10.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have since had the
conversation with him
right before I walked on today,
and he laid

05:14.213 --> 05:15.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it out very clearly.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He'd already made that decision.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd been thinking about it for
months.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, the
president tweeted
that he is a very active
president and it's

05:22.288 --> 05:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not possible for his surrogates
to have perfect
accuracy.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Press Secretary Spicer summed up
the Comey
firing this way today:

05:29.462 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: This is always
going to be the
president's decision, to hire
someone, to

05:32.565 --> 05:33.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fire someone.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He made a decision, in part
based on the recommendation.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is now focused on making
sure that
we will have a replacement at
the FBI.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Spicer said
there is no set
timeline for the president to
choose his new

05:43.242 --> 05:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI nominee, that it will happen
when he finds
the right person.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:49.549 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are joined
now from
the White House by correspondent
John Yang.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, John, a few other threads
that we want
to pursue right now.

05:57.890 --> 06:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, the president was asked
earlier this
week by Senator Lindsey Graham
for a letter

06:02.729 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to certify that he had -- to
explain what
his connections are to Russia.

06:09.435 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now you have seen that letter.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it say?

06:11.604 --> 06:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it's from his
tax attorneys.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have looked at the past 10
years of his
tax returns.

06:16.542 --> 06:21.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say they show no
investments in Russia,
show no loan payments, interest
payments to

06:21.681 --> 06:23.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lenders from Russia.

06:23.549 --> 06:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the only income was
about $12 million
in 2013 for the Miss Universe
Pageant and

06:29.689 --> 06:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the proceeds for a $95 million
sale of a Florida
estate to a Russian billionaire.

06:37.330 --> 06:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But tax experts say that this is
not conclusive,
that there are many other ways
that the president

06:43.436 --> 06:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could have dealings with Russia
that are not
included in this letter.

06:47.940 --> 06:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, John,
separately, another
issue that's come up in all this
back and

06:52.145 --> 06:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forth that we just heard from
Lisa has to
do with the White House press
briefing, and

06:57.717 --> 07:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president had something
interesting to
say about that today.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He's got an idea of
his own.

07:01.988 --> 07:08.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, instead of a daily
briefing, there
should only be a briefing once
every two weeks,

07:08.094 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that he should give it.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he thinks that's a good
idea.

07:12.064 --> 07:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we don't know
yet whether
that's going to take place.

07:16.369 --> 07:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just quickly, John, one other
story I want
to ask you about, the
conflicting reports

07:20.072 --> 07:24.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about a dinner that the
president had with
James Comey in late January?

07:24.644 --> 07:26.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

07:26.446 --> 07:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the interview with NBC's
Lester Holt, the
president said that this was a
dinner that

07:31.184 --> 07:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Comey had asked for because
he wanted
to keep his job.

07:35.555 --> 07:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friends of Mr. Comey's say that
that was actually
not the case from his point of
view.

07:41.694 --> 07:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says that he was asked to
come to the White
House for dinner.

07:45.665 --> 07:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he also said -- Comey said
that he was
asked several times by the
president whether

07:51.637 --> 07:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he could have his personal
loyalty, whether
the president would have his
personal loyalty.

07:56.976 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that all he could
promise was that
he would have his honesty.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot to keep
track of.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang, we thank you.

08:07.386 --> 08:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will get another view of
the firing
of FBI Director Comey from
former Secretary

08:11.657 --> 08:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of State Condoleezza Rice.

08:13.359 --> 08:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's right after the news
summary.

08:16.596 --> 08:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
massive cyber-attack
struck major institutions and
companies in

08:21.601 --> 08:23.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than 70 countries.

08:23.569 --> 08:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The computer systems were
infected with so-called
ransomware that demands money in
exchange

08:29.075 --> 08:30.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for unlocking data.

08:30.843 --> 08:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The malware is believed to have
exploited
a cyber-hacking tool that was
used by the

08:35.481 --> 08:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Security Agency that
was broken into
last year.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Kingdom was among the
hardest-hit,
forcing its National Health
Service to close

08:44.824 --> 08:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dozens of hospitals and medical
centers.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News
has this report.

08:50.763 --> 08:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: It is a sinister
development,
the very people we turn to when
we're sick

08:55.701 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or injured, themselves under a
concerted and
highly sophisticated attack.

09:01.874 --> 09:06.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hospitals and other NHS
organizations only
realizing something was wrong
when someone

09:06.846 --> 09:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeared to take control of
their vital computer
systems, and then this message
demanding immediate

09:13.419 --> 09:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payment, with the threat that
invaluable records
will be deleted in a week if the
money wasn't

09:18.858 --> 09:20.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
paid.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The result is chaos.

09:22.328 --> 09:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the hospitals affected,
treatment has been
postponed and ambulances
diverted.

09:26.666 --> 09:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not all hospitals have been
targeted, but
those that have are widespread.

09:31.370 --> 09:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Emma Simpson (ph) took her
son Seb (ph)
for a check on his broken toe,
they joined

09:35.508 --> 09:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the thousands of patients
inconvenienced.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: They said, I'm really
sorry, but the
computer system is down.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You are going to have to go
away.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't have any appointments.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be dangerous to do so
because we
can't access any of the files.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: But this local
doctor described
the impact.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

09:51.023 --> 09:51.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROB BARNETT, General
Practitioner: We have
become isolated.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got no access to the
records.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got no access to
electronic prescriptions.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have got no access to
investigations on
patients.

09:59.265 --> 10:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: Latest information
suggests as
many as 40 health trusts may now
be affected.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The message to patients is
hardly reassuring.

10:08.174 --> 10:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two top security
firms said
most of the infected computers
were in Russia.

10:14.814 --> 10:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russian Interior Ministry
reported that
roughly 1,000 of its devices
were affected.

10:20.186 --> 10:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's still not clear who or what
is behind
the cyber-attack.

10:24.590 --> 10:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Justice Department has
issued a directive
to federal prosecutors to seek
tougher sentences

10:30.363 --> 10:33.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the vast majority of
criminal suspects.

10:33.466 --> 10:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The move is a direct reversal of
the policy
that was put in place under
former President

10:38.337 --> 10:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama, which sought to reduce
prison overcrowding.

10:41.507 --> 10:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have more on the impact
of the new
sentencing directive a little
later in the

10:46.312 --> 10:47.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration has
unveiled its
new trade deal with China.

10:50.983 --> 10:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of the agreement,
Beijing will lift
a 13-year-old ban on U.S. beef
imports.

10:56.789 --> 11:03.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It will also allow U.S.
shipments of liquefied
natural gas and open the Chinese
market to

11:03.195 --> 11:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. credit card companies.

11:05.264 --> 11:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chinese banks in turn will be
permitted to
enter the U.S. financial market,
but an exact

11:10.736 --> 11:13.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
date has yet to be set.

11:13.172 --> 11:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. immigration agents have
arrested nearly
1,400 suspected gang members
across the U.S.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a massive six-week operation.

11:22.748 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agency
said fewer than a third of those
arrested

11:27.386 --> 11:29.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were illegal aliens.

11:29.055 --> 11:34.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 1,100 people taken into
custody are
being held on criminal charges.

11:34.393 --> 11:37.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, the agency's acting
director said
the crackdown is far from over.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS HOMAN, Acting Director,
U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement: Let me
be clear that

11:40.800 --> 11:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these violent criminal street
gangs are the
biggest threat facing our
communities.

11:45.638 --> 11:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, we speak about what we
have done the
past six weeks.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, I want to make sure there's
no mistake.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are not done.

11:53.379 --> 11:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The crackdown is
the largest
anti-gang operation in the
agency's history.

11:58.784 --> 12:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea's parliament sent a
rare letter
to the U.S. Congress today
protesting new

12:03.622 --> 12:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctions that the House of
Representatives
passed earlier this month.

12:07.993 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They target the North's shipping
industry,
and were in response to its
nuclear program.

12:13.532 --> 12:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea called the measure a
-- quote
-- "heinous act against
humanity," and said

12:18.304 --> 12:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "The U.S. House of
Representatives
should think twice."

12:21.841 --> 12:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't immediately clear how
the letter
was sent, since the U.S. and
Pyongyang have

12:26.712 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no formal diplomatic relations.

12:29.715 --> 12:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hepatitis C infections have now
nearly tripled
in the U.S.

12:34.019 --> 12:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to a new report
from the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

12:38.958 --> 12:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers attribute the
increase to the
opioid epidemic and a spike in
heroin use

12:44.063 --> 12:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the years 2010 to 2015.

12:46.499 --> 12:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The highest rates of infections
were among
people in their 20s who inject
drugs.

12:52.404 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fiat Chrysler is recalling more
than a million
Ram pickup trucks in the U.S. to
fix a software

12:59.211 --> 13:00.946 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
glitch.

13:00.980 --> 13:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The automaker said the error
could prevent
side air bags and seat belts
from working

13:05.384 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during a vehicle rollover.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The defect has been blamed for
at least one
death.

13:11.190 --> 13:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stocks were mixed on Wall
Street today
after poor showings by
department stores and

13:16.061 --> 13:17.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Treasury yields.

13:17.563 --> 13:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
23 points to close at 20896.

13:23.269 --> 13:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose five points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped three.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, both the Dow and
the S&amp;P 500
lost a fraction of a percent.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a fraction of a
percent.

13:35.581 --> 13:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
former Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice on
pivotal moments

13:40.386 --> 13:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in democracy's history, amid her
take on the
latest twists and turns out of
the Trump White

13:46.158 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House; what tougher penalties
could mean for
crime rates, drug use and the
prison population;

13:53.699 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and Ramesh Ponnuru
analyze this
tumultuous week of news; and a
musician coming

13:59.972 --> 14:14.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to terms with being
unconventional.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now one-on-one with Condoleezza
Rice.

14:17.289 --> 14:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with the former
secretary of state
earlier today to discuss
President Trump's

14:22.027 --> 14:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abrupt firing of former FBI
Director James
Comey, the investigation into
Russia's meddling

14:28.200 --> 14:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. election, and her
new book, "Democracy:
Stories From the Long Road to
Freedom."

14:35.875 --> 14:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Condoleezza Rice,
thank you very
much for talking with us.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE, Former U.S.
Secretary of
State: A pleasure to be with
you.

14:39.678 --> 14:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump,
as you know,
fired the FBI director, James
Comey, this

14:43.816 --> 14:45.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are someone who has served
at the highest
levels of government.

14:48.621 --> 14:54.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you believe what the
president did, at
the moment of the Russia
investigation going

14:54.126 --> 14:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on, crossed any ethical lines?

14:56.362 --> 15:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, the
president obviously
had the authority to relieve the
FBI director.

15:01.967 --> 15:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, these are 10-year
terms because
it should be rare that that
happens.

15:06.839 --> 15:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I really think, at this
point, we need
to settle down, step back and
let the investigation

15:13.646 --> 15:15.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
move forward.

15:15.414 --> 15:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have great confidence that
whoever is at
the FBI is going to find a group
of career

15:20.052 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who are dedicated to a
thorough investigation.

15:24.723 --> 15:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Intelligence has all of
the tools that
it needs, all the information,
because, Judy,

15:30.829 --> 15:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worry that this is starting to
erode people's
confidence in our institutions.

15:35.868 --> 15:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we shouldn't have that
erosion, because
we have institutions that can
handle even

15:42.408 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disruption of this kind.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we need to find out what
happened.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a hostile act by a
foreign power.

15:48.547 --> 15:52.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need to find out what
happened and let
the facts fall where they do.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the
president said the
investigation should go forward,
but he's

15:56.188 --> 16:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also called it a charade and
said that it
all stems from Democrats being
angry over

16:01.560 --> 16:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the outcome of the election.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he himself has undermined
what's going
on.

16:05.531 --> 16:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, whatever
is said,
the investigation will go
forward, and it

16:11.003 --> 16:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will reveal whatever happened
there.

16:13.906 --> 16:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so my view, and I think it's
probably
shared by a lot of my fellow
citizens, is,

16:20.713 --> 16:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could we get on with this and
really find
out what happened here?

16:24.083 --> 16:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I look at Vladimir
Putin as somebody
who is an eye-for-an-eye kind of
person.

16:29.388 --> 16:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We questioned the legitimacy of
his election
in 2012, Secretary Clinton did
-- rightly,

16:34.059 --> 16:35.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the way.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It did have -- it was quite
fraudulent.

16:38.497 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he's saying now,
I'm going
to show you that I can do the
same thing.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we shouldn't let him do
that.

16:44.937 --> 16:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should have confidence in our
institutions,
let them get started, let them
get finished,

16:50.609 --> 16:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we have a lot of other
work to do
on behalf of the American
people.

16:54.313 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To get to the
bottom of this
is going to take time, is going
to take an

16:59.084 --> 17:00.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

17:00.819 --> 17:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This country needs to take
seriously what
President Putin has done and his
government

17:05.624 --> 17:06.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has done, shouldn't it?

17:06.892 --> 17:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: We absolutely
need to take
it seriously.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As I said, it's a hostile act.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are ways to handle
even hostile
acts.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We say to the Russians, we know
you did it.

17:14.600 --> 17:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a time of our choosing, we
will find a
way to punish that behavior.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we do have confidence in our
institutions.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are not Russia.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have an executive that is
constrained.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a legislature that is
real.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a press that is free.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have courts that are
independent.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not Russia.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't have to allow him
to draw that
parallel.

17:37.556 --> 17:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separate, but
related question,
the attorney general, Jeff
Sessions, had a

17:43.295 --> 17:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role in essentially signing off
on the decision
to fire the director of the FBI,
at a time

17:52.905 --> 17:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the attorney general had
himself recused
himself from the Russia
investigation because

17:59.778 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of things that had happened
before this.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You wrote a letter of
endorsement for the
attorney general.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Any concern about that?

18:07.686 --> 18:10.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: I still have
the highest
regard for Jeff Sessions.

18:10.522 --> 18:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I can't -- I don't think
any of us know
now what the course of events
actually as

18:18.030 --> 18:19.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it led to this.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seems to be a lot of
confusion about
what came when from whom.

18:23.001 --> 18:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let the White House speak to why
this unfolded
in the particular way, but I
have a lot of

18:28.907 --> 18:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
confidence in Jeff Sessions.

18:30.709 --> 18:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
in the middle
of all this, the president had a
meeting in

18:35.280 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Oval Office with the Russian
foreign minister,
Sergei Lavrov, with the Russian
ambassador

18:40.285 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What of this, again, at the same
time this
investigation is under way?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I don't
have a problem
with him meeting with the
Russian foreign

18:50.395 --> 18:52.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minister.

18:52.598 --> 18:57.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Putin received
Secretary Tillerson
when he was in Moscow.

18:57.269 --> 19:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be reciprocal for the
president to
receive the foreign minister of
Russia when

19:02.407 --> 19:04.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's in Washington.

19:04.276 --> 19:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have important things to talk
to the Russians
about, despite their meddling in
our elections.

19:09.148 --> 19:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope they're talking about a
way to eventually
end this horrific humanitarian
crisis in Syria,

19:15.821 --> 19:16.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end that war.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians have more leverage
than we do.

19:18.924 --> 19:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope they're talking about the
fact that,
if Kim Jong-un's long-range
missiles can reach

19:25.264 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alaska one day, they can also
reach Vladivostok.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
with the ambassador
to the U.S.?

19:30.269 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, the
ambassador is
going to always accompany the
foreign minister.

19:34.339 --> 19:39.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so not everything is
abnormal in this
situation, and that seemed to be
perfectly

19:39.578 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The book.

19:42.581 --> 19:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You write with great passion
about how important
it is for the United States to
pursue democracy,

19:47.819 --> 19:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democratic values, freedom, as
it pursues
its foreign policy in the decade
to come.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why was it important to you to
write this
book now?

19:56.228 --> 19:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: I think, on
some level,
I have always wanted to write
this book, because

19:59.598 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there is a kind of
mystery about democracy.

20:02.367 --> 20:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do people come to trust
these abstract
institutions, the Constitution,
rule of law,

20:09.141 --> 20:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts, elections, to carry out
their concerns,
rather than going to the
streets?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that happen?

20:14.780 --> 20:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the United States, you
know, I grew
up in Birmingham, Alabama.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We weren't full citizens.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My parents couldn't go to a
movie theater
with me.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My dad couldn't register to vote
in 1952.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet I remember very well --
and I relayed
it in the book -- standing as --
being in

20:30.729 --> 20:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the car with my uncle on the way
back from
school.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was Election Day.

20:34.266 --> 20:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And George Wallace was about to
be elected
governor of Alabama.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my 6-or-so-year-old self
knew that that
wasn't good for black people.

20:40.939 --> 20:44.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were lines and lines of
black people
voting.

20:44.142 --> 20:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I said to him, "So, this man
Wallace can't
win if all these people vote."

20:48.180 --> 20:49.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he said, "No."

20:49.147 --> 20:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said, "We are minority."

20:50.782 --> 20:53.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said, "He will win."

20:53.285 --> 20:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I said, "Then why do they
bother?"

20:55.254 --> 20:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "Because they know
that, one day,
that vote will matter."

20:59.324 --> 21:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have always seen people
around the world
doing that, and I think people
have this -- they

21:04.630 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are attracted to it.

21:06.431 --> 21:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a moral case for
supporting people
who want the same benefits that
we have.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are safer when we support
democratic development
as well.

21:15.440 --> 21:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were a -- one
of the major
advocates for Rex Tillerson
being hired to

21:20.279 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the secretary of state.

21:22.047 --> 21:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president is proposing a
25 percent
cut in the budget of the State
Department.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you concerned?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I don't
think you
will see cuts of that magnitude.

21:31.790 --> 21:36.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's remember, the
administration proposes,
but it's the Congress that
authorizes and

21:36.662 --> 21:38.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appropriates.

21:38.597 --> 21:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you're going to have
to see some
rebalancing, because diplomacy
is a very important

21:42.267 --> 21:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of national security.

21:44.002 --> 21:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are some efficiencies
that the
State Department could achieve.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there's no doubt about
that.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the numbers have
gone up a lot.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There seem to be many more
people.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, maybe there are
efficiencies.

21:56.014 --> 22:01.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when I look to the
department, I look,
first of all, at a Foreign
Service that is

22:01.887 --> 22:03.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already a bit stretched.

22:03.755 --> 22:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember Bob Gates once said
there are more
people in military bands than
foreign service

22:09.294 --> 22:11.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officers.

22:11.096 --> 22:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also see programs that have
just redounded
to America's benefit abroad, for
instance,

22:16.335 --> 22:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the President's Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief,
that showed our compassion and
saved the continent

22:21.206 --> 22:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from pandemic, the Millennium
Challenge, which
is a foreign assistance program
that is predicated

22:28.180 --> 22:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the idea that you get foreign
assistance
only if you're governing wisely,
fighting

22:32.284 --> 22:33.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corruption.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why wouldn't you want to help
countries like
that?

22:35.253 --> 22:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, we needed to raise the
defense budget,
but we need to be careful that
we keep our

22:39.224 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
diplomatic tools intact as well.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're
confident that the
things that you just described
are going to

22:45.897 --> 22:46.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
survive?

22:46.898 --> 22:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:48.600 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I
certainly am going
to be out there arguing for
them.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And a lot of people are.

22:51.236 --> 22:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, in the book, I
try to explain
to people that democracy
promotion isn't all

22:58.443 --> 23:00.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that expensive.

23:00.579 --> 23:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we think of it, one of the
regrets I
have about Iraq and Afghanistan,
and say this,

23:06.485 --> 23:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that people have come to
think of that
as democracy promotion.

23:10.288 --> 23:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was so hard, and that
was the loss
of life and so expensive.

23:14.226 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would never have said to
President Bush,
use military force to bring
democracy to Iraq

23:18.730 --> 23:20.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Afghanistan.

23:20.198 --> 23:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had a security problem in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

23:23.502 --> 23:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We used military force to bring
down those
governments.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then we had to have a view.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What comes after?

23:30.509 --> 23:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we thought that it was
better to give
the Iraqi and Afghan people a
pathway to democracy.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're
describing things
that I don't hear this
administration talking

23:39.117 --> 23:40.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're talking about more
troops in Afghanistan
15 years after the U.S. first
went in.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Yes.

23:44.856 --> 23:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we may well need more
troops, but we're
also going to need -- you know,
we didn't

23:48.226 --> 23:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stabilize and win the hearts and
minds and
ultimately the stability of
Germany and Japan

23:53.331 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with our military forces alone.

23:55.967 --> 24:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We defeated imperial Japan, and
we defeated
Nazi Germany, but it was the bet
on a democratic

24:02.774 --> 24:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany, on a democratic Japan
that they would
never again threaten their
neighbors, that's

24:08.113 --> 24:09.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what paid off.

24:09.514 --> 24:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they are firm pillars of
international
stability.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question,
human rights.

24:15.587 --> 24:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Tillerson has spoken
out forcefully
just in the last few days about
how, in making

24:21.026 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions about U.S. policy,
national security,
that human rights and American
values can't

24:27.165 --> 24:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be part of that conversation
right now.

24:29.067 --> 24:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I heard
a little bit
more nuanced speech from
Secretary Tillerson

24:32.537 --> 24:34.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this.

24:34.306 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember when I gave the
speech in Egypt
in 2005 saying Egypt had to
leave the world

24:39.077 --> 24:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for democracy and reform, and
people said,
well, then how can you talk to
Mubarak?

24:43.515 --> 24:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you have to talk to the
Egyptian president
or the Turkish president.

24:48.854 --> 24:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to talk to people who
have bad human
rights records.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had to sit with Moammar
Gadhafi, for goodness'
sakes.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, policy, you do have
to deal with
people who don't share your
values.

25:00.665 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you are always better off to
remember
that your values and your
interests are linked

25:06.671 --> 25:08.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the long run.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's how America has
prospered.

25:10.542 --> 25:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the moral case is that we
are an idea.

25:14.346 --> 25:19.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it can't be that liberty is
right for
us and not for them.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the language here will
matter.

25:23.388 --> 25:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw nuance in that speech, but
I do want
to hear the administration say
that America's

25:28.627 --> 25:31.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
always going to stand for the
voiceless.

25:31.496 --> 25:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is what has made us a great
power.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are you
hearing them say
that?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: These are
early days.

25:37.202 --> 25:42.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Condoleezza Rice,
thank you
very much, the book, "Democracy:
Stories From

25:42.107 --> 25:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Long Road to Freedom."

25:45.443 --> 25:48.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

25:48.079 --> 25:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you.

25:53.385 --> 25:59.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has long put
law and order at the top of his
White House

25:59.624 --> 26:01.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

26:01.626 --> 26:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But today's move to seek tougher
prison sentencing
policies marks the biggest
effort yet to dismantle

26:06.731 --> 26:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his predecessor's criminal
justice reform
legacy.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

26:12.137 --> 26:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: I have
empowered our prosecutors to
charge and pursue

26:17.175 --> 26:24.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most serious offense, as I
believe the
law requires, most serious
readily provable

26:24.182 --> 26:26.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
offense.

26:26.184 --> 26:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that we are going to
meet our responsibility
to enforce the law with judgment
and fairness.

26:31.022 --> 26:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With that,
U.S. Attorney
General Jeff Sessions ordered
federal prosecutors

26:35.327 --> 26:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the country to revive
some of the toughest
practices of the decades-old war
on drugs.

26:40.966 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I trust our
prosecutors in
the field to make good
judgments.

26:46.471 --> 26:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They deserve to be unhandcuffed
and not micromanaged
from Washington.

26:52.243 --> 26:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you are a drug trafficker, we
will not
look the other way.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will not be willfully blind
to your misconduct.

26:59.784 --> 27:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This memo
reverses Obama
administration policies that
aimed to lessen

27:04.823 --> 27:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the federal prison population by
not charging
low-level nonviolent drug
offenders with long

27:09.995 --> 27:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mandatory minimum sentences.

27:11.763 --> 27:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, then Attorney General
Eric Holder
told prosecutors to leave drug
quantities

27:17.135 --> 27:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of charging documents to cut
down on unduly
harsh sentences that didn't --
quote -- "promote

27:22.907 --> 27:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public safety deterrence and
rehabilitation."

27:25.744 --> 27:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These directives coincided with
U.S. sentencing
commission changes and Obama
administration

27:30.415 --> 27:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clemency initiatives that
provided second
chances for low-level federal
drug offenders.

27:37.055 --> 27:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That led to a sharp decline in
the federal
prison population.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2013, the federal prison
population sat
at nearly 220,000.

27:44.295 --> 27:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, that number stands just
under 190,000.

27:48.800 --> 27:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In reaction to Sessions' memo
today, former
Attorney General Holder called
the move "dumb

27:53.304 --> 27:55.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on crime."

27:55.106 --> 27:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republican Senator Rand Paul
of Kentucky
said these new policies will
accentuate the

27:58.977 --> 28:03.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
injustice of "unfairly
incarcerating a disproportionate
amount of minorities."

28:03.948 --> 28:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March, President Trump
created a new national
commission to combat the opioid
crisis.

28:08.486 --> 28:12.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Drug abuse has become a
crippling problem

28:12.390 --> 28:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throughout the United States.

28:14.192 --> 28:18.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today,
Sessions listed the
opioid epidemic and a spike in
violence in

28:18.296 --> 28:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big cities as reasons for this
return to harsher
sentences.

28:21.499 --> 28:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: Drug trafficking
is an inherently
dangerous and violent business.

28:26.571 --> 28:30.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to collect a drug
debt, you can't
file a lawsuit in court.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You collect it with the barrel
of a gun.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the memo,
Sessions does
leave discretion up to
prosecutors to avoid

28:36.681 --> 28:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unjust sentences, but those
exceptions would
need to be approved and
documented.

28:42.921 --> 28:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, we are joined by two
former directors
of the White House Office of
National Drug

28:47.826 --> 28:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Control, known more commonly as
the country's
drug czars.

28:50.495 --> 28:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gil Kerlikowske served as
President Obama's
drug policy adviser from 2009 to
2014, before

28:55.800 --> 28:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming commissioner of Customs
and Border
Patrol.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He retired from that post in
January.

29:00.405 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Walters served as drug
czar for all
eight years of George W. Bush's
presidency.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the chief operating
officer of the Hudson
Institute, a conservative think
tank.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Walters, let me start with
you.

29:12.117 --> 29:16.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
Don't mandatory minimums
handcuff judges,
take away some of their
discretion, and
disproportionately

29:16.488 --> 29:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affect the poor and people of
color?

29:18.490 --> 29:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN WALTERS, Hudson Institute:
Well, what
they do is, they target in the
federal level

29:21.392 --> 29:22.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more senior traffickers.

29:22.961 --> 29:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they try to protect people
from this horrible
drug epidemic.

29:26.965 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the issue is whether or
not we're
going to have equity across the
system.

29:30.935 --> 29:35.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of these were created for
two reasons,
one, to create equity across the
system for

29:35.907 --> 29:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious offenses, so that some
people in some
places or shopping judges wasn't
a way to

29:41.246 --> 29:43.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
avoid a fair and equal
punishment.

29:43.815 --> 29:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two, the sentences were used to
create evidence
from individuals pending
conviction to help

29:50.488 --> 29:52.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
break down whole drug
organizations.

29:52.957 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They worked.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need them now.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the most deadly drug
epidemic in the
history of the United States
under way.

29:59.030 --> 30:04.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gil
Kerlikowske, does this
dismantle in some ways some of
what you started

30:04.202 --> 30:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to accomplish as drug czar in
your administration
and perhaps slow the momentum
for what seems

30:08.907 --> 30:13.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a bipartisan approach and
understanding
towards criminal justice reform?

30:13.878 --> 30:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE, Former U.S.
Drug Policy Director:
Well, in some ways, it does, but
let's separate

30:17.849 --> 30:19.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the opioid epidemic.

30:19.417 --> 30:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I took office in 2009, it
wasn't really
on the public's radar screen.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
These are pills.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are not being smuggled in
across the
country.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not being manufactured
in some garage.

30:30.395 --> 30:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is driven by our medical
practices, which,
by the way, is governed at the
state level.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So try to separate out the
opioid issue.

30:40.104 --> 30:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The heroin issue is different,
although it
certainly is connected.

30:43.942 --> 30:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're a trafficker, a
drug trafficker,
I couldn't agree more with what
the attorney

30:48.580 --> 30:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general said, because if you're
a drug trafficker
and you're indicted by the
federal government,

30:53.418 --> 30:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's usually for a substantial
amount of drugs,
and so that's important.

30:58.990 --> 31:05.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gil
Kerlikowske, I also
want to ask, does this -- what
about the argument

31:05.496 --> 31:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Jeff Sessions makes that
says that this
takes the handcuffs off of
prosecutors?

31:11.102 --> 31:14.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prosecutors have been
complaining for some
time that they can't use a large
sentence

31:14.539 --> 31:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as leverage to get the type of
information
that they need.

31:17.175 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE: Well, the large
sentence
can be helpful.

31:20.044 --> 31:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, remember, too, there are
finite resources
in the Department of Justice.

31:24.883 --> 31:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are finite jail space
availability in
the federal government.

31:29.854 --> 31:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so reserving those spaces
and reserving
those prosecutors for the most
serious crimes

31:35.827 --> 31:37.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is very important.

31:37.328 --> 31:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spent almost eight years in
the administration,
all but four months.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I met with a number of U.S.
attorneys and
assistant U.S. attorneys.

31:45.403 --> 31:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't hear them complaining
about the way
they were being dealt with by
what's fondly

31:51.943 --> 31:53.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called main justice.

31:53.811 --> 31:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John Walters,
I want to
ask, you mentioned the heroin
epidemic, and

31:58.249 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gil also seconded that.

32:00.451 --> 32:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about going after the
distribution and
the manufacture?

32:03.288 --> 32:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I have to show I.D. to
get a bottle
of NyQuil over the counter, yet
a town in

32:07.825 --> 32:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia of a population of
800 can get
300,000 pills shipped to it over
a few years.

32:13.898 --> 32:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN WALTERS: Yes, I think the
enforcement
of the diversion of drugs, pill
mills and

32:18.803 --> 32:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other kinds of diversion of
synthetic opioids
are important.

32:22.573 --> 32:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, that was what was
happening in
five, six years ago.

32:27.245 --> 32:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the death rate is driven
by criminally
produced synthetic fentanyl and
heroin.

32:33.952 --> 32:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is killing more people
every year
than all the names on the
Vietnam Veterans

32:39.190 --> 32:40.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Memorial.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary of HHS Price mentioned
that.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In addition, that number is
accelerating.

32:44.896 --> 32:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened is, we have lost
control of
these organizations, and we need
to be able

32:49.400 --> 32:51.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to enforce the law.

32:51.269 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You yourself have had the author
of "Dreamland"
on this program, the story of
the pills and

32:55.740 --> 32:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heroin coming together to create
this carnage.

32:58.476 --> 33:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He notes that some of these
gangs were parking
outside drug treatment centers
to give free

33:02.914 --> 33:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
samples of heroin to people to
readdict them
or to keep them from getting
into treatment.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those people need to go to jail.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to assign a much larger
effort.

33:11.656 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to stop talking about
there is limited
resources in the federal system
and the state

33:16.527 --> 33:18.329 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to bring together public
health efforts
to bring people into treatment
and we need

33:20.898 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to stop the flow of this poison.

33:22.500 --> 33:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is killing more Americans
than all gun
and automobile accidents
combined.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's accelerating.

33:29.807 --> 33:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in addition to that,
cocaine production
out of Colombia is going back to
the old track

33:34.479 --> 33:35.980 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are in the midst of facing a
perfect storm,
and we're not on top of it.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need law enforcement to work,
as we need
treatment to work.

33:42.387 --> 33:47.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gil
Kerlikowske, he's pointing
to the inflow of drugs from
outside.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president has proposed a
border wall.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were the head of Border and
Customs.

33:52.063 --> 33:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will a border wall work to stop
what he's
describing?

33:54.499 --> 33:58.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE: Well, one, the
border wall
certainly won't work, because
when we talk

33:58.970 --> 34:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about heroin and fentanyl -- and
let's be
clear -- 17,000 people perished
as a result

34:04.475 --> 34:06.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the pills in the United
States.

34:07.011 --> 34:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's considerably more than
the heroin coming
into the United States.

34:11.382 --> 34:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But heroin and fentanyl, a very
powerful painkiller,
come in between -- or at our
ports of entry.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People carry it on their
persons.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People try to conceal it in
vehicles.

34:22.393 --> 34:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you wanted to slow that down,
you would
actually not worry so much about
a wall.

34:26.964 --> 34:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would actually give more
resources, drug-sniffing
dogs, technology at our ports of
entry, not

34:33.838 --> 34:35.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between our ports.

34:35.339 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John Walters,
I want to
give you a chance to respond.

34:37.308 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN WALTERS: Yes, I think,
look, fentanyl
is a change, and it's now the
driving forces

34:43.214 --> 34:44.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in many of these deaths.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the vast majority of the
drugs killings
Americans are coming from
overseas.

34:48.653 --> 34:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vast majority of those are
coming over
the Mexican border.

34:51.389 --> 34:55.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vast majority of those walk
within six
feet of a uniformed border
agent.

34:55.660 --> 35:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a significant and
dramatic failure
of intelligence and operations.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need the cooperation of the
Mexicans.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to do a better job.

35:03.668 --> 35:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The deaths in this country are
going to approach
100,000 a year pretty soon, and
it's already

35:09.507 --> 35:10.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
staggering.

35:10.875 --> 35:22.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gil
Kerlikowske, John Walters,
thank you both.

35:22.720 --> 35:32.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now back to
the dominant
story of the week, the FBI
director's firing

35:32.296 --> 35:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the fallout from it, with
the analysis
of Shields and Ramesh Ponnuru.

35:36.734 --> 35:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
National Review senior editor
Ramesh Ponnuru.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks is away.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome, gentlemen.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

35:47.111 --> 35:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mark, any question that the
president
was within his authority to fire
James Comey?

35:53.084 --> 35:55.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was within his authority,
Judy.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this wasn't amateur hour.

35:59.157 --> 36:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was an incomprehensibly
incompetent,
inept amateur week, beginning
and ending with

36:08.599 --> 36:09.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

36:09.867 --> 36:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other people came out with eggs
of all sorts
on their faces.

36:13.304 --> 36:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody associated with them
is diminished,
sullied, stained in some way.

36:17.475 --> 36:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this was Donald Trump's
total miscalculation.

36:22.180 --> 36:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man who made a national
reputation by
saying "You're fired" didn't
have the decency

36:27.652 --> 36:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call the FBI director in
person, and publicly
humiliated him and embarrassed
him by severing

36:35.726 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, announcing it on cable
television as
he was speaking to FBI
colleagues in Los Angeles.

36:42.733 --> 36:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has thus insured that
this will be,
with this Russian investigation,
is now a

36:48.739 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
permanent part of our political
landscape.

36:51.809 --> 36:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will affect and influence and
be an outline
of the 2018 election, and
perhaps even beyond.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Total
miscalculation, Ramesh?

36:59.183 --> 37:04.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMESH PONNURU: The
administration combined
two of its hallmarks, reacting
to these events

37:04.956 --> 37:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with disorganized dishonesty.

37:07.858 --> 37:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They began by saying that the
firing was a
response to the FBI director's
handling of

37:15.866 --> 37:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Clinton e-mail story and the
analysis
of that handling by the deputy
attorney general,

37:22.006 --> 37:23.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rod Rosenstein.

37:23.774 --> 37:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by the end of the week,
President Trump
himself was saying it really
wasn't about

37:27.211 --> 37:28.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those things.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had made his decision before
the memo,
and the decision was really
motivated by the

37:32.383 --> 37:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that Comey wasn't shutting
down the Russia
investigation, the investigation
into the

37:39.056 --> 37:42.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
administration and the
campaign's ties to
Russia, and thus exploded
everything that

37:42.627 --> 37:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people had been saying in the
administration's
defense earlier in the week.

37:45.763 --> 37:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Mark,
they have given
several different explanations
over the course

37:49.967 --> 37:51.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a few days.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you believe was behind
this?

37:52.703 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Donald Trump.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy, think about this.

37:56.574 --> 38:01.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Robert Mueller was the
predecessor at the
FBI before James Comey.

38:01.746 --> 38:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was there from 2001 to 2013
under President
George W. Bush and President
Barack Obama.

38:09.887 --> 38:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how often they had
dinner or
how often they met privately.

38:14.558 --> 38:21.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But can you imagine Robert
Mueller being asked
by George W. Bush or Barack
Obama, not once,

38:21.499 --> 38:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not twice, but three times, am I
the subject
of a criminal investigation by
your department,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by your agency?

38:29.373 --> 38:30.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's unthinkable.

38:30.508 --> 38:33.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is -- obviously, he
wants this to
go away.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He, the president, wants this
whole investigation
to go away.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has guaranteed -- he has
guaranteed
the following.

38:40.751 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Comey was enormously
popular among the
FBI workers.

38:45.022 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was somebody who was
thoughtful and supportive
of his employees and colleagues.

38:48.726 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they liked him.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was would take one for a
team.

38:52.963 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was willing to take criticism
for the FBI,
and in spite of the decision he
made on Hillary

38:57.935 --> 39:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and the handling of
that, which a
lot of people disagreed it.

39:01.605 --> 39:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's guaranteed, Donald Trump
has, that everybody
associated with the FBI is going
to make one

39:07.378 --> 39:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more call, follow up on one more
lead, and
work one hour harder every day
on the pursuit

39:13.250 --> 39:14.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this case.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not going to go away.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has guaranteed that it's
going to be more
pursued even more arduously,
intently, passionately,

39:20.358 --> 39:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and professionally by the
bureau.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see
as a fallout,
Ramesh?

39:24.462 --> 39:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, I think
that this may
be the beginning of an effort by
the administration

39:28.999 --> 39:32.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to push a lot of congressional
Republicans
somewhere they don't want to go.

39:33.003 --> 39:37.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The prevailing line from
Republicans, even
those who are well-disposed
towards President

39:37.608 --> 39:42.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, has been, of course the
FBI and of
course the congressional
Intelligence Committee

39:42.046 --> 39:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigations need to continue.

39:44.615 --> 39:49.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is coming out of Trump
world right now
is, no, these investigations are
an attempt

39:49.320 --> 39:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cast doubt on the legitimacy
of Trump's
presidency.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a taxpayer-funded charade.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you believe that, these
things need to
end.

39:57.862 --> 40:01.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is that something that
congressional Republicans
are really going to accept?

40:01.866 --> 40:05.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not something that I
think they're
going to want to try to sell to
the American

40:05.336 --> 40:06.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

40:06.504 --> 40:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
Congress moving
on this?

40:07.905 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Congress
is under tremendous
pressure now.

40:09.740 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The committees have to perform,
because any
foot-dragging on this at this
point, at any

40:15.579 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, the administration, the
White House
will be seen as somehow hiding
something,

40:20.584 --> 40:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there is something here to
hide.

40:22.386 --> 40:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the president boasting
that, three
times, you exculpated me in the
letter that

40:27.658 --> 40:30.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says I'm firing you, I think it
puts pressure
there.

40:30.060 --> 40:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it guarantees that any
appropriations
by an investigating agency will
be fast-lined

40:38.402 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and will be available.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody wants to be seen on that
other side.

40:43.240 --> 40:48.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, there are 241 Republican
House seats
right now.

40:48.345 --> 40:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2018, they're all on the
ballot; 175 of
those members of the 241 have
never run for

40:56.887 --> 41:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reelection with a Republican
president in
the White House.

41:00.825 --> 41:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're used to being on the
offensive in
midterm elections, running
against -- or for

41:05.996 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeal Obamacare, or against the
administration.

41:08.866 --> 41:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to have to decide,
and a lot
of them.

41:11.802 --> 41:16.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're looking right now at
losing three
dozen House seats, by historical
standards.

41:16.106 --> 41:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to decide right now,
are they going
to establish daylight and
independence from

41:20.611 --> 41:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this toxic administration?

41:22.580 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This administration this week
was so absolutely
misleading, dishonest in its
handling of this,

41:30.888 --> 41:34.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the White House right now
at this point
doesn't even believe its own
leaks.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is that bad.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really reached that point.

41:38.295 --> 41:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you are a Republican, you
cannot be
seen on the side of trying to
slow this down,

41:44.702 --> 41:46.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cover it up, hide things.

41:46.504 --> 41:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: You do have to
wonder whether
the Senate is capable of
confirming anybody

41:51.408 --> 41:54.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the FBI director position.

41:54.311 --> 41:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that person doesn't have a
demonstrated
record of independence and
integrity, I think

41:58.649 --> 42:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's going to be very hard for
them to get
the requisite votes.

42:00.784 --> 42:02.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:02.253 --> 42:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You think Rudy
Giuliani is a
good choice at this point?

42:03.587 --> 42:04.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:04.655 --> 42:06.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: There is a
narrow Senate margin.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you are going to be
not looking
for political figures.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Absolutely.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I think you're
going to be
looking for people like Judge
Silberman, people

42:11.128 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Michael Chertoff, people
who are respected
across the aisle.

42:13.564 --> 42:18.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ramesh, what
about Mark's larger
point here that this is really a
turning point

42:18.168 --> 42:23.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this administration, a
turning point in
terms of how Congress sees the
administration?

42:23.207 --> 42:24.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know yet about the
public.

42:24.742 --> 42:29.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't seen any public
opinion polls yet,
significant ones.

42:29.179 --> 42:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what about the Congress?

42:30.948 --> 42:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, look, I do
think that
this story right now is a topic
of consuming

42:33.050 --> 42:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interest in Washington, D.C.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know that it is in the
country at
large.

42:37.755 --> 42:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think this is running
the risk of
isolating this president
politically.

42:42.793 --> 42:47.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a reason why
congressional Republicans
have not felt it was in their
interest to

42:47.264 --> 42:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just say, these investigations
are all legitimate.

42:50.234 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a reason why the
administration's
first instinct was to come up
with a pretext

42:56.173 --> 43:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for dismissing Comey and not tie
it to the
Russia investigation.

43:00.444 --> 43:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's going to be
really hard
for them to sustain this,
particularly when

43:04.815 --> 43:09.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you consider that President
Trump remains
somebody who, for this early in
his presidency,

43:09.687 --> 43:11.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is pretty unpopular.

43:11.522 --> 43:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean because
now it's out
in the open that the rationale
was the Russia

43:14.358 --> 43:16.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation?

43:16.126 --> 43:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: That's right,
and because
Trump seems inclined to want to
push this

43:18.629 --> 43:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argument further, and he seems
to want his
surrogates to be making this
argument.

43:22.399 --> 43:26.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, have we
learned something
new about the president in all
of this?

43:26.337 --> 43:32.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this the coming together of
everything
that we already believed?

43:32.076 --> 43:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how do you see this
moment?

43:35.446 --> 43:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, you see that
the president
thinks and acts in very short
time frames.

43:42.252 --> 43:46.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, if you wanted to get rid
of the FBI
director, there is an
established way of doing

43:46.457 --> 43:48.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these things.

43:48.158 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get a mutual friend to go to
him and say,
the president wants your
resignation, and

43:52.763 --> 43:56.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will do it on your terms, and
we will exchange
letters, and there will be a
Rose Garden ceremony,

43:56.667 --> 44:00.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we will introduce your
successor, and
you will leave with a great
tribute and great

44:00.938 --> 44:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- and it's not Donald Trump.

44:04.074 --> 44:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Either he's scared, or anxious
or whatever,
but he had to do it in a hurry.

44:09.046 --> 44:10.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he did it in his way.

44:10.848 --> 44:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did it to the point where
he's totally
discredited, if not disabled,
his own press

44:15.119 --> 44:16.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secretary.

44:16.854 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's totally discredited or
partially
discredited Mike Pence, his vice
president,

44:22.192 --> 44:28.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who his reputation is based on
his earnestness
and his decency, not on his
great imagination

44:28.265 --> 44:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or great vision, but he's a
solid guy.

44:31.268 --> 44:33.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is a guy you can trust.

44:33.137 --> 44:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got caught in a total lie,
pretending that
Rod Rosenstein, two weeks on the
job as deputy

44:41.278 --> 44:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorney general, somehow
barreled into the
White House and said, take this,
Mr. President,

44:46.050 --> 44:47.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have got to do it.

44:47.051 --> 44:48.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now think about Rod Rosenstein.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What does he do?

44:50.120 --> 44:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a man who has earned a
reputation, a
deserved reputation, bipartisan
respect as

44:54.458 --> 44:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being a straight shooter.

44:55.826 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been used as a pawn in this
thing.

44:58.729 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was advanced as the reason,
when he knew
he wasn't the reason.

45:02.566 --> 45:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now he's got to prove his
independence,
if he's going to be in charge of
this investigation.

45:07.037 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's not going to be -- no
pressure can
be applied to him.

45:10.941 --> 45:14.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it appears to be, again, it's
going to
be redound to the detriment of
the White House

45:14.978 --> 45:16.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the president.

45:16.914 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have seen some
analysis this
week, Ramesh, that people are
watching moderate

45:20.250 --> 45:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, especially in the
Senate, to
see how they react.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is their calculus?

45:26.123 --> 45:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do they look for as they
decide how to
respond to this and what to do?

45:30.494 --> 45:34.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, I think
that they are
going to be nervous.

45:34.765 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to want to go
out on a limb
and defend the administration,
particularly

45:39.703 --> 45:43.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when the line for the
administration keeps
changing.

45:43.140 --> 45:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you go out on the limb, the
administration
might saw that limb out right
from behind

45:47.277 --> 45:48.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

45:48.512 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The political pressures on them
are going
to be intense.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to want to look
for ways to
get out from those political
pressures.

45:54.451 --> 45:59.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could be that the end
result of this
is that it has strengthened the
case for a

45:59.423 --> 46:03.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
special prosecutor, an
independent commission
or a select committee of
Congress.

46:03.127 --> 46:05.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mark said --
I want to
ask you about -- I think, Mark,
you said,

46:05.095 --> 46:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what, three -- you think three
dozen Republican...

46:07.464 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: House seats that
right now...

46:09.199 --> 46:10.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:10.200 --> 46:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... are in
jeopardy.

46:11.902 --> 46:12.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Historically,
presidents under
50 -- this president is going to
be under

46:12.669 --> 46:14.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
40 percent favorable.

46:14.438 --> 46:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just Ramesh's point is, I think,
a very good
one that bears -- it bears
reflection on,

46:21.211 --> 46:28.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the idea, Judy, that The
Wall Street
Journal editorial page leads its
endorsement

46:28.418 --> 46:35.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of firing Comey by quoting, the
president
had reacted to the deputy
attorney general's

46:35.092 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
initiative in doing it.

46:36.760 --> 46:40.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they're supporting Donald
Trump, and they
have got egg all over there.

46:40.264 --> 46:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got a poultry farm on
their face.

46:41.932 --> 46:43.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:43.033 --> 46:44.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, let's be
honest about
it.

46:44.802 --> 46:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to be -- have him say, have
-- how about
being accused of being a
showboat by Donald

46:50.040 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

46:51.241 --> 46:54.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that is tantamount to being
called ugly
by a frog.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump has never
been a shrinking
violet before.

46:56.713 --> 47:00.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't know grandstanding was
a mortal sin
in his lexicon.

47:00.551 --> 47:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you look
for in the
days to come to see where this
goes, Ramesh?

47:04.354 --> 47:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I think I would
start looking
for the congressional Republican
reactions.

47:07.624 --> 47:13.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that a lot of
people today have
been very vocal in response to
President Trump's

47:13.397 --> 47:15.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tweeting about tapes of...

47:15.365 --> 47:17.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:17.201 --> 47:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, by the way,
we don't know
whether there is a recording
system in the

47:18.802 --> 47:19.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

47:19.803 --> 47:21.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAMESH PONNURU: Right.

47:21.572 --> 47:22.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think -- but the question
is, do they
just try to ride this out, or do
they start

47:22.739 --> 47:23.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
criticizing the president?

47:23.740 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

47:26.009 --> 47:31.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think, Judy, I
think that
it's going to be every man and
woman for him

47:31.782 --> 47:35.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or her self, and they're going
to realize
that their fate, fortune and
future is not

47:35.819 --> 47:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be well-served being
tied to this
president.

47:38.188 --> 47:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, a week that
won't be
forgotten anytime soon.

47:42.359 --> 47:50.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, Ramesh Ponnuru,
thank you.

47:50.667 --> 48:02.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next: another in our occasional
series My
Music, giving artists a chance
to talk about

48:02.346 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their work.

48:04.014 --> 48:08.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, singer-songwriter
Alynda Segarra
of the band Hurray for the Riff
Raff.

48:08.685 --> 48:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She performed recently at
Washington, D.C.'s
9:30 Club.

48:12.656 --> 48:18.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Segarra was just 17 years old
when she left
her home in the Bronx in what
she said was

48:18.295 --> 48:20.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a search for American music.

48:20.464 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now 30, she's returned to her
roots in New
York with a new album exploring
her Puerto

48:25.702 --> 48:27.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rican heritage.

48:28.005 --> 48:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYNDA SEGARRA, Hurray for the
Riff Raff:
The people who have gotten me
through my life

48:38.315 --> 48:48.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the weirdoes and the poets,
the rebellious
women and the activists.

48:48.358 --> 48:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the weirdoes and the poets,
the rebellious
women and the activists.

48:55.332 --> 49:08.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were considered the
riffraff by people
in power, and they're the ones
that make history.

49:08.145 --> 49:21.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am Alynda Segarra , the lead
singer of Hurray
for the Riff Raff.

49:21.358 --> 49:22.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My path was really
unconventional.

49:22.759 --> 49:26.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I knew I was doing bad in
school.

49:26.897 --> 49:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I dropped out, and I ended
up running
away.

49:30.067 --> 49:42.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was really hard on my
family.

49:42.646 --> 49:48.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I traveled by hitchhiking
with friends
and riding freight trains,
because Woody Guthrie

49:48.552 --> 49:52.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rode freight trains, and playing
music on
the street in New Orleans,
because I needed

49:52.456 --> 49:57.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do something to make money.

49:57.260 --> 50:09.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new album, "The Navigator,"
is about a
young girl growing up in a very
big city.

50:09.573 --> 50:16.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she is based off of me, but
she's a little
bit more of a superhero than I
am.

50:16.446 --> 50:26.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's me realizing what I lost
when I ran away
from home, realizing what shame
did to me,

50:26.490 --> 50:31.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really trying to get in
touch with what
it means to be a Puerto Rican
woman, what

50:31.194 --> 50:42.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that means musically.

50:42.739 --> 50:51.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My path of running away, I look
back on it
now, and I'm like, I could have
been killed.

50:51.581 --> 51:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of the journey was me
realizing
that there were odds stacked
against me, and

51:06.496 --> 51:18.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deciding to be OK with not being
rich, saying,
OK, I will make music.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will play in coffee shops.

51:20.277 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will play in houses.

51:21.678 --> 51:34.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will play in these tiny places
that only
10 people will come.

51:35.025 --> 51:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to do it because I
believe in art
and I believe in what I'm doing.

51:47.604 --> 51:54.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great music.

51:54.711 --> 52:01.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, we want you to take
a look around,

for military bases.

53:02.078 --> 53:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
