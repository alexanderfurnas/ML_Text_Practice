HAVING TO DRIVE 20 30RKS, 40

19:00.133 --> 19:01.267
DIFFICULT TO GET CIGARETTES.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.367
IN ADDITION WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

19:02.367 --> 19:05.000
THE IDEA OF PRICING CIGARETTES

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
APPROPRIATELY SO THAT ULTIMATELY

19:06.000 --> 19:07.167
BECOMES A HARDSHIP TO USE THOS

DOWN ONE OF THE PLANS HERE

19:21.500 --> 19:22.333
WHAT'S NEXT?

19:22.333 --> 19:24.100
DO WE CHANGE PACKAGING

IT WOULD BE.

19:41.633 --> 19:42.767
THERE'S PROBABLY MOR

19:42.767 --> 19:43.533
INFORMATION ON THIS COMING OUT

19:43.533 --> 19:44.033
IN THE FUTURE.

19:44.033 --> 19:45.667

INCREASE TAXES ON CIGARETTES

19:56.700 --> 19:56.900
CIGARETTES

19:56.900 --> 19:58.133
RATHER THAN IN THE FORM OF

19:58.133 --> 19:59.467
PRICING OF CIGARETTE PRICING

19:59.467 --> 20:02.267
THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE

20:02.267 --> 20:03.633
ALTHOUGH THIS DOES BECOME, I

20:03.633 --> 20:05.467
USED THIS TERM BEFORE, A

20:05.467 --> 20:05.567
HARDSHIP

20:05.567 --> 20:07.867
IN REALITY MY ROLE AS SURGEO

20:07.867 --> 20:09.067

20:12.800 --> 20:15.900
YES, PRICING IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY

20:15.900 --> 20:17.000
OF DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM

20:17.000 --> 20:18.533
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO

20:46.433 --> 20:47.700
AT THIS POINT.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.667
THE REALITY IS THEY ARE STILL AN

ADDICTIVE PRODUCT IN
