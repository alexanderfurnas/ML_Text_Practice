SAYING

04:58.433 --> 05:00.467
>> SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS

05:00.467 --> 05:02.100
TELLING FEDERAL AGENCIES AND

05:02.100 --> 05:03.667
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ESPECIALLY

05:03.667 --> 05:04.600
FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ANALYZE AL

05:04.600 --> 05:06.800
OF THE RISKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

05:06.800 --> 05:08.067
MAY HAVE TO THEIR MISSIONS AND

05:08.067 --> 05:10.100
WHAT THEY DO, TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

05:10.100 --> 05:11.600
THEY ARE ALREADY DOING AND WHA

05:11.600 --> 05:13.100
THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND SETS UP

05:13.100 --> 05:18.033
A TASK FORCE TO PUT ALL OF THESE

05:18.033 --> 05:19.433
SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATION

05:19.433 --> 05:21.467
TOGETHER AND ANALYSIS OVER THE

TEETH OR HOW DOES IT WORK ACROSS

05:25.233 --> 05:26.067
THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

05:26.067 --> 05:27.000
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT

05:27.000 --> 05:28.633
THIS TASK FORCE IS IT IS LAYIN

05:28.633 --> 05:31.900
DOWN THE POLICY INSIDE THE OBAMA

05:31.900 --> 05:35.067
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE SORT OF

05:35.067 --> 05:39.533
STUFF HE CAN'T DO THROUG

05:39.533 --> 05:41.767
CONGRESS AND SO THE REAL

05:41.767 --> 05:45.067
QUESTION COMES TO FUNDING.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.333
WE NEED "X" AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO

05:47.333 --> 05:49.200
REBRIDGE THIS BRIDGE, SHORE UP

05:52.500 --> 05:54.633
PREPARED FOR WILDFIRES AND

05:54.633 --> 05:56.333
EXCESSIVE HEAT, IT WIL

05:56.333 --> 05:58.033
ULTIMATELY BE UP TO CONGRESS T

05:58.033 --> 05:59.867
DECIDE HOW TO APPROPRIATE BUT TO

05:59.867 --> 06:02.267
THE EXTENT HE CAN USE EXECUTIV

06:02.267 --> 06:03.467
POWER TO FURTHER HIS POLIC

06:03.467 --> 06:05.367
GOALS AND SAY, HEY, I BELIEV

06:05.367 --> 06:06.333
CLIMATE CHANGE EXISTS AND WE

06:06.333 --> 06:07.733
NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.100
THIS IS HIS EFFORT TO DO THAT.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.133
>> SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR

06:11.133 --> 06:12.000
LOCAL GOVERNMENT

06:12.000 --> 06:14.100
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU

06:14.100 --> 06:15.667
OUTLINED RAISING BRIDGES AND S

06:15.667 --> 06:16.700
FORTH, THAT ALL COSTS MONEY.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.200
>> IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WANT T

06:18.200 --> 06:20.167
MAKE THE CASE THAT THEY NEEDED

06:20.167 --> 06:21.867
ADDED INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS

06:21.867 --> 06:24.367
THEY CAN CERTAINLY DO IT IN THIS

06:24.367 --> 06:26.200
CONTEXT TO SAY WE'RE COASTAL

06:26.200 --> 06:28.967
WE'RE IN A TORNADO ZONE, OR WHAT

06:28.967 --> 06:29.433
HAVE YOU

06:29.433 --> 06:32.000
BUT TO THE EXTENT THE LOCA

06:32.000 --> 06:34.133
GOVERNMENTS DON'T WANT T

06:34.133 --> 06:35.367
ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE, TH

06:35.367 --> 06:36.867
QUESTION THEN BECOMES IS THE

06:36.867 --> 06:37.933
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING TO BE

06:37.933 --> 06:41.767
AT LEAST UNDER THE OBAMA

06:41.767 --> 06:43.100
ADMINISTRATION HOLDING THI

06:43.100 --> 06:45.600
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THIS POLIC

06:45.600 --> 06:47.900
OVER THEIR HEADS AS A THREAT T

06:47.900 --> 06:48.733
WITHHOLD FUNDING

06:48.733 --> 06:50.267
>> THERE WAS A RECENT REPORT OUT

06:50.267 --> 06:52.300
BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

06:52.300 --> 06:55.300
A THREE-YEAR LONG STUDY TO LOO

06:55.300 --> 06:57.133
AT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE CAN AFFECT

06:57.133 --> 07:00.200
THE NAVAL BASE IN NORFOLK,

07:00.200 --> 07:00.700
VIRGINIA

07:00.700 --> 07:02.100
PARTS OF THAT NAVAL BASE COULD

07:02.100 --> 07:03.033
BE UNDER WATER

07:03.033 --> 07:05.233
WHEN WE LOOK AT COMMUNITIES,

07:05.233 --> 07:07.000
INCLUDING MILITARY COMMUNITIES

07:07.000 --> 07:07.967
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

07:07.967 --> 07:09.733
AFFECTED BY THIS, TOO?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.000
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

07:11.000 --> 07:13.833
AMONG THE AGENCIES THAT AR

07:13.833 --> 07:15.500
TASKED WITH COMING UP WITH A

07:15.500 --> 07:16.667
ANALYSIS OVER THE COURSE OF TH

07:16.667 --> 07:18.333
NEXT NINE MONTHS IS FRONT AN

07:18.333 --> 07:19.967
CENTER THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

07:19.967 --> 07:22.267
AND HOUSING AND URBA

07:22.267 --> 07:23.733
DEVELOPMENT AND THE EPA AN

07:23.733 --> 07:23.867
SUCH

07:23.867 --> 07:26.967
THE D.O.D. IS ONE OF THE FOCUSES

07:26.967 --> 07:28.867
OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE BEING ASKED

07:28.867 --> 07:31.133
TO ASSESS HOW CLIMATE CHANGE MAY

07:31.133 --> 07:32.333
IMPACT THEIR MISSION AND WHA

07:32.333 --> 07:32.833
THEY DO.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.167
>> SO NOW THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE

07:35.167 --> 07:38.633
ORDER, A TASK FORCE FOR NINE

07:38.633 --> 07:39.667
MONTHS, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.400
>> THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD I

07:41.400 --> 07:42.067
REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'

07:42.067 --> 07:44.400
WIDELY EXPECTED TO OVERLAP THE

07:44.400 --> 07:46.267
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE OBAMA

07:46.267 --> 07:47.033
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO B

07:47.033 --> 07:49.400
PAK MAKING A DECISION ON THE

07:49.400 --> 07:50.767
KEYSTONE PIPELINE OUT OF CANAD

07:50.767 --> 07:52.933
WHICH IS AN ISSUE THAT THE

07:52.933 --> 07:56.467
CANADIANS WANT APPROVED AND TH

07:56.467 --> 07:58.000
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY HA

07:58.000 --> 07:58.633
RALLIED AGAINST.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.267
SO FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

08:00.267 --> 08:01.833
THE TIMETABLE OF THIS IS GOING

08:01.833 --> 08:03.900
TO OVERLAP OR COINCIDE VER

08:03.900 --> 08:04.733
LIKELY WITH THAT DECISION.

08:04.733 --> 08:06.533
SO A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS OVE

08:06.533 --> 08:08.000
THE NEXT NINE MONTHS MAY B

08:08.000 --> 08:09.100
POLITICAL, WHO IS JOINING TH

08:09.100 --> 08:11.300
TASK FORCE, WHAT ARE THEY ASKING

08:11.300 --> 08:17.933
FOR, HOW DOES THIS DOVETAIL WITH

08:17.933 --> 08:19.600
THE POLITICAL CASE HE'S MAKING

08:19.600 --> 08:21.267
THAT HE'S A STEWARD OF THE

08:21.267 --> 08:22.167
ENVIRONMENT.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.733

09:30.100 --> 09:31.533
IS THAT THE CHEMICALS PUMPED

09:35.967 --> 09:37.567
EXTRACT THE GAS WILL LEAK OR

FAVOR OF USING MORE NATURAL GA

10:25.700 --> 10:27.567
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO COA
