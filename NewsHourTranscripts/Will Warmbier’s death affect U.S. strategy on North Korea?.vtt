JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
quiet and tragic end to the
sad story of Otto Warmbier, and

00:07.333 --> 00:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the implications for the United
States' dealings with his
former captors in North Korea.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

00:13.866 --> 00:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Speaking in
the Oval Office, President
Trump condemned the
death of Otto Warmbier,

00:16.933 --> 00:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who had been detained in
North Korea for nearly
a year-and-a-half.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: It's a total
disgrace, what happened to Otto.

00:23.766 --> 00:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It should never, ever
be allowed to happen.

00:27.266 --> 00:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump
also indirectly blamed
the Obama administration
for not getting him

00:31.733 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home sooner.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He should have
brought home that same day.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The result would have
been a lot different.

00:36.733 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president's
spokesman said Warmbier's death
casts a shadow on Mr. Trump's

00:43.766 --> 00:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stated willingness to talk to
his North Korean counterpart
under the right conditions.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: Clearly, we're
moving further away, not closer

00:50.066 --> 00:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to those conditions
being enacted.

00:52.133 --> 00:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, the president
seemed to abandon his goal of
enlisting China to pressure

00:56.600 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea: "While I greatly
appreciate the efforts of
President Xi and China to help

01:02.800 --> 01:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with North Korea, it
has not worked out.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least I know China tried."

01:07.800 --> 01:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Korea's release of
the 22-year-old Warmbier
has increased, not eased
tensions with Pyongyang.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He arrived in Ohio
last week in a coma.

01:17.833 --> 01:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doctors said Warmbier suffered a
severe neurological injury with
extensive loss of brain tissue,

01:24.833 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
likely as a result of a
lack of blood to his brain.

01:26.833 --> 01:28.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:28.933 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL KANTER, University of
Cincinnati Health: A state
of unresponsive wakefulness.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He'd been sentenced
in March 2016 to 15 years hard
labor for allegedly taking

01:37.066 --> 01:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a propaganda poster
from a Pyongyang hotel.

01:40.766 --> 01:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Warmbier's
parents said, "The awful,
torturous mistreatment
our son received

01:47.766 --> 01:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the hands of the North
Koreans ensured that no
other outcome was possible."

01:53.100 --> 01:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an interview broadcast today
on CBS News, newly-elected
South Korean President Moon

01:57.433 --> 01:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jae-in joined in
condemning the North.

01:59.733 --> 02:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President (through translator):
I believe we must now have the

02:03.633 --> 02:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perception that North Korea
is an irrational regime.

02:07.166 --> 02:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Moon, who had
campaigned on engaging
North Korea, said all
options are on the table.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN (through
translator): When it comes
to preemptive strike,
which you mentioned,

02:16.500 --> 02:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe that this is something
we may be able to discuss
at a later stage, when the

02:22.466 --> 02:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
threat has become
even more urgent.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: North Korea
still holds three other
Americans as prisoners.

02:27.266 --> 02:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a pair of U.S. B-1B
bombers, like these, flew
over South Korea, just
below the demilitarized

02:34.766 --> 02:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zone, in a show of force.

02:36.866 --> 02:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what effect will the
death of Otto Warmbier
have on the wider, and
seemingly intractable,

02:43.333 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
question of how the
United States should
deal with North Korea?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What options are left?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To probe those questions
and more, we turn to veteran
diplomat Kathleen Stephens.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was U.S. ambassador to
South Korea from 2008 to 2011.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now at
Stanford University.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where she
joins us tonight.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ambassador Stephens, thank you.

03:04.766 --> 03:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about that question?

03:06.800 --> 03:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this tragic story of Otto
Warmbier going to affect,
have any impact on the way the

03:13.533 --> 03:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States
approaches North Korea?

03:15.766 --> 03:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS, Former U.S.
Ambassador to South Korea:
Well, I certainly think it's

03:18.700 --> 03:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reminder to us that the threat
and the danger that North Korea
poses, not just to the United

03:25.866 --> 03:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States, but to the region and
the world, goes even beyond
its nuclear missile programs,

03:30.500 --> 03:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which we have been so
rightly focused on in
recent weeks and months.

03:37.433 --> 03:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also need to add, I myself
want to just express my deepest
condolences to the Warmbier

03:40.433 --> 03:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family and to all the
friends, and I know there
are many, and family of Otto.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The treatment that he received
while under North Korean
custody for a year-and-a-half

03:51.833 --> 03:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was appalling and outrageous.

03:54.300 --> 03:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the North
Koreans owe a full
explanation to his family
and to the United States of

03:59.133 --> 04:01.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what happened.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Does the approach,
is it complicated by the fact
that there are three Americans

04:03.766 --> 04:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still being held?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well,
I think it concentrates
the mind certainly of
the United States, and

04:11.366 --> 04:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope in Pyongyang as well,
that this is untenable.

04:14.933 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would hope that, in the
coming days - - and I believe
this will happen -- that

04:19.833 --> 04:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there will be a renewed pressure
and effort to win the release
of these three Americans

04:27.300 --> 04:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who are being held.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are others of other
nationalities as well.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea in an area of
allowing access to foreigners
who have been arrested while

04:37.666 --> 04:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in North Korea, which it is
obligated to do under standard
diplomatic procedure, it hasn't

04:41.033 --> 04:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
met those obligations,
as it doesn't meet its
obligations in other areas.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It needs to do that.

04:46.666 --> 04:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it really needs to move
-- to stop this practice of
holding, arresting and holding

04:53.500 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
citizens, not allowing
their representatives
from their countries
to have access to them,

04:57.400 --> 05:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and often using them as or
hoping to use them as leverage
to -- as hostages, essentially,

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and as bargaining chips.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It needs to stop.

05:05.733 --> 05:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It needs to be a part of our
overall approach and effort.

05:08.333 --> 05:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has been, but it needs to
be reemphasized going forward
that this too is part of the

05:15.333 --> 05:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
effort to get North
Korea to live up to some
minimal standards of
international behavior.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Live up to
some minimal standards.

05:20.733 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have had sanctions in
place for a long time.

05:23.133 --> 05:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had people describe
it as an irrational regime.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the real pressure
points on North Korea?

05:30.666 --> 05:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What can make a
difference to North Korea?

05:34.166 --> 05:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, it is
a very challenging question.

05:38.133 --> 05:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one thing that
remains very important
is, notwithstanding maybe
some welcome realism

05:46.100 --> 05:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about perhaps the limits of
what China can or will do,
China does remain an important

05:52.300 --> 05:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actor in this, as
does South Korea.

05:55.033 --> 06:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, with meetings
coming up tomorrow in
Washington -- Secretary
Tillerson and Mattis

06:01.500 --> 06:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be meeting with their
Chinese counterparts.

06:03.466 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next week, the new South Korean
president, Moon Jae-in, will
be meeting with President

06:08.100 --> 06:10.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

06:10.133 --> 06:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, North Korea will
be very much on the agenda,
but, in the context of what's

06:15.566 --> 06:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened, these are going to
be even more somber meetings.

06:17.633 --> 06:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think the effort
will be to look both at
better implementation
of the pressure and

06:23.466 --> 06:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctions now in effect, and
also into some new ones that
might bring greater pressure

06:28.866 --> 06:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get North Korea to take a
different path and a path that
will lead to some discussion

06:35.266 --> 06:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of how it can meet its
international obligations.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Moon,
of course, ran on a campaign
talking about engagement with

06:40.633 --> 06:42.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Korea.

06:42.700 --> 06:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He wanted to go to the
-- to pressure North
Korea to the negotiating
table, while President

06:48.533 --> 06:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump talks about pressuring
North Korea to get rid
of its nuclear program.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What are the chances
or the likelihood that
these two leaders can
find a common approach

06:56.166 --> 06:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to North Korea when they meet
here in Washington next week?

06:59.033 --> 07:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, it's
their very first meeting.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're both very new in office,
President Moon in particular.

07:05.733 --> 07:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think a lot is
going to depend on the
kind of relationship
and rapport they're able

07:09.033 --> 07:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to establish with each other.

07:11.100 --> 07:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump established a
good rapport with the Japanese
prime minister, of course,

07:14.533 --> 07:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Chinese president, Mr.
Xi, although today he seemed
to be a little bit disappointed

07:19.133 --> 07:20.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in him.

07:20.766 --> 07:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So I think, one, the
personal relationship is
going to be important.

07:23.333 --> 07:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, two, I think it will be
important for President Moon
to explain the South Korean

07:30.133 --> 07:32.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
perspective.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The South Koreans actually
over many decades have seen
thousands and thousands of their

07:35.966 --> 07:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
citizens abducted and
held in the North, and
six are being held right
now just within recent

07:43.500 --> 07:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months and years.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, this is a heartfelt
issue for South Korea,
as well, as well as, of
course, the continuing

07:50.433 --> 07:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security threat of North Korea.

07:51.933 --> 07:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they're under no
illusions about the threat.

07:55.700 --> 08:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge will be, as you
suggest, how to harmonize these
approaches and also harmonize

08:02.666 --> 08:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them with China's approach in
the region, which certainly
sees the need for a change

08:06.100 --> 08:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in behavior in North
Korea, but they're
worried about instability.

08:08.900 --> 08:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not going to be easy,
but having these meetings
is an important first step.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ambassador Kathleen
Stephens, thanks for joining us.
