ENTIRE 90 MINUTES THAT VIEWERS

02:46.267 --> 02:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ROMNEY HAD WON, IT WAS THE

02:54.833 --> 02:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

02:55.900 --> 02:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMED TO BE A KIND OF

02:58.400 --> 02:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LENT OBAMA AND VERY ASSURED IN

03:02.333 --> 03:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMAND ROMNEY.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT IS WHAT I THINK YOU NEED

03:04.367 --> 03:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO AS

03:06.267 --> 03:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PERHAPS THE EXPECTATION FOR

03:14.667 --> 03:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP IS CAN HE LOOK

03:17.100 --> 03:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:19.133 --> 03:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIMSELF FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME,

03:20.667 --> 03:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF

03:22.567 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTATION WE HAVE FOR HIM THAN

03:23.833 --> 03:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAS HAD

03:25.333 --> 03:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCH A LONG CAREER IN PUBLIC

03:27.300 --> 03:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AN APP WHICH WILL DELIVER A

03:32.067 --> 03:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NONLETHAL BUT PAINFUL SHOCK TO

03:33.667 --> 03:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY ANALYST THAT SAYS THEY HAVE

03:34.833 --> 03:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO APPEAR PRESIDENTIAL.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SUGGEST

03:38.467 --> 03:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE SHOULD PUT ON 200 POUNDS

03:39.833 --> 03:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LOOK LIKE WILLIAM HOWARD

TAFT.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MORE SERIOUSLY, I THINK

03:44.000 --> 03:46.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A DANGER OF OVERSTATING

03:46.367 --> 03:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SO

03:48.667 --> 03:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM OF

03:51.100 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATES, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY

03:53.900 --> 03:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO PUBLIC OFFICE BUT NO CIVIC

ENGAGEMENT THAT HE IS GOING TO

03:56.900 --> 03:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE HELD TO A QUOTE LOWER

STANDARD.

03:58.733 --> 04:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK-- I UNDERSTAND THE

04:00.700 --> 04:03.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT, BUT I DO THINK THAT 90

04:03.567 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINUTES ONE-ON-ONE WITH ONE OF

04:06.833 --> 04:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

04:08.567 --> 04:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT A

04:10.100 --> 04:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE-LINER OR A DISMISSIVE ANSWER

04:12.133 --> 04:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:13.333 --> 04:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLEXITIES OF SAY, DEALING

04:14.667 --> 04:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH NATO COUNTRIES UNDER ATTACK

04:16.367 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR HIM.

04:19.833 --> 04:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT IF HE AFTER 90

04:24.100 --> 04:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINUTES CAN'T OFFER A COHERENT

04:28.933 --> 04:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE MEANS, THAT

04:30.200 --> 04:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO COST HIM.

04:31.133 --> 04:31.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU IN A

04:31.967 --> 04:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORMER LIFE HAVE ALSO HELPED

04:33.433 --> 04:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATES PREPARE FOR THESE

04:34.300 --> 04:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTS.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING INTO IT, WHAT WOULD YOU

04:35.967 --> 04:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES

04:37.733 --> 04:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY?

04:38.267 --> 04:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I DO

04:41.233 --> 04:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT I WOULD ADVISE

04:44.100 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON IT WOULD BE A

04:45.900 --> 04:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH TOUGHER PIECE OF ADVICE

04:47.333 --> 04:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT WHAT

04:49.433 --> 04:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP IS-- I'M SURE IS BEING

04:51.600 --> 04:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOLD IS PROVIDE AN ANSWER THAT

04:53.033 --> 04:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUGGESTS YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH

04:53.933 --> 04:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TOPIC, AND ALSO COUNTER HER

04:57.600 --> 04:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE, THIS IS WHAT I ONCE

04:59.733 --> 05:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED POLITICAL JUDO, TAKE THE

05:01.567 --> 05:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTH AS A WEAKNESS.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU ARE SO EXPERIENCED, WHY

05:03.833 --> 05:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID YOU VOTE FOR THE WAR IN

05:04.767 --> 05:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID WE MAKE SUCH A HASH OF

05:07.100 --> 05:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA AND LIBYA.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER CHALLENGE, I THINK, WOULD BE

05:10.000 --> 05:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT, AND THEN

05:13.633 --> 05:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS YOU

05:14.733 --> 05:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO DO IS A PRESIDENT IS TO

05:16.833 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES THE WAY

05:18.533 --> 05:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY LEARNED AFTER THE

05:20.400 --> 05:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAY OF PIGS NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH

05:22.333 --> 05:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUST IN THE MILITARY DURING THE

05:25.233 --> 05:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBAN NUCLEAR CRISIS.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TEN THURN IT.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK SHE MIGHT ALL DIM

05:30.600 --> 05:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD, YOU DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE

05:31.700 --> 05:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ADMITTING A MISS TACK, THAT

05:32.933 --> 05:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS I BAD NOTION FOR BEING A

05:34.200 --> 05:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE CASE OF ADVISING HILLARY

05:37.200 --> 05:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON, THERE NEEDS TO BE THIS

05:38.700 --> 05:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINE LINE BETWEEN TRYING TO

05:39.833 --> 05:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVE THAT SHE'S SMARTER THAN HE

05:42.300 --> 05:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS, WHICH WOULD NOT BE THE RIGHT

05:44.067 --> 05:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO GO, AND THEN TAKE HIS

05:46.933 --> 05:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPLAIN

05:50.000 --> 05:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THAT MATTERS.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISN'T JUST A CIVICS TEST.

05:52.833 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS ABOUT GOVERNING AS

06:04.167 --> 06:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:05.933 --> 06:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MODERATED MANY OF THESE DEBATES

STEPPED WAY OVER THE LINE ON

FACTUAL MATTERS WHICH I THINK AS

06:17.533 --> 06:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MATTER OF FACT HE HAS, THAT TO

08:15.067 --> 08:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, I

08:17.433 --> 08:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK IT'S PROBABLY MAKING THE

08:19.400 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLIC MUCH MORE UPSET BECAUSE

08:20.867 --> 08:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOWED THEM A PIECE OF IT

08:25.467 --> 08:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTEAD OF THE FULL THING.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT JUST MUDDIES THE ISSUE EVEN

08:29.400 --> 08:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FURTHER AND I KNOW IT MAKES MORE

08:30.933 --> 08:31.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE UPSET.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES IT

08:33.400 --> 08:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO TO THE FABRIC OF THE

08:35.300 --> 08:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE

08:36.167 --> 08:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAPPENS AND WHEN THERE IS

08:38.467 --> 08:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY A HEIGHTENED

08:40.100 --> 08:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENSION, ESPECIALLY AROUND RACE.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT

08:43.567 --> 08:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CALL THE CONTINUUM, THE

08:45.867 --> 08:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANGE OF CONTACTS THAT PEOPLE

08:48.233 --> 08:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD WITH THE POLICE FROM JUST

08:49.667 --> 08:51.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING STOPPED AND ASKED

08:51.367 --> 08:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS TO BEING STOPPED AND

08:52.700 --> 08:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEARCHED TO PERHAPS A DEADLY

08:54.867 --> 08:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICE.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE RANGE SAYS WOW, MY SIDE

08:59.867 --> 09:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE STORY WASN'T TAKEN OR THE

09:02.033 --> 09:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE RECORD WOULD NOT EVEN

09:03.433 --> 09:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVEAL WHAT HAPPENED FROM MY

09:05.300 --> 09:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDPOINT, WE WERE ONLY GETTING

09:06.633 --> 09:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR STANDPOINT.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE ANY

09:08.400 --> 09:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS AT ALL WORKING IN FRAMING

09:11.300 --> 09:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW A COMMUNITY APPROACHES

09:12.867 --> 09:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE AND GETTING RESULTS

09:15.167 --> 09:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE SAW VERY DIFFERENT

09:16.700 --> 09:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTCOMES IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA THAN

09:18.233 --> 09:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DID IN NORTH CAROLINA.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK MEASURES OF

09:21.967 --> 09:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNT ABILITY, THE VICTIMS OF

09:24.433 --> 09:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TULSA WAS THEY RELEASED-- THE

09:26.100 --> 09:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE WAS THEY RELEASED THE

09:28.067 --> 09:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOTAGE EARLY IN TULSA.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAD A SENSE OF HERE IS MORE

09:30.500 --> 09:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DATA ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO TALLY

09:33.333 --> 09:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE CONNECTIONS TO POLICE

09:34.400 --> 09:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS WHERE THEY KNOW THEM

09:36.533 --> 09:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE COMMUNITY, SO IT COMES

09:38.600 --> 09:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVING SOME STRONGER

09:40.167 --> 09:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTIONS AMONGST THE PEOPLE

09:40.933 --> 09:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BEING SEEN AS FULLY HUMAN

09:43.400 --> 09:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT ONE-TO-ONE REACH COULD,

09:45.267 --> 09:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, SCALE UP TO A GENERAL

09:48.067 --> 09:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERCEPTION OF TRUST.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO THAT.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE HAVE TO WORK FROM BOTH

09:52.333 --> 09:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENDS IN CHANGING IN THE ONLY THE

09:53.767 --> 09:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CULTURE OF POLICING BUT THE

09:55.200 --> 09:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRUCTURE OF INEQUALITY THAT

09:56.700 --> 09:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT POLICE ARE

09:57.933 --> 09:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT WE CALL,

09:59.600 --> 10:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SEE, THAT I AM RECOGNIZED

10:03.267 --> 10:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULLY AS A PERSON.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IF ALL OF THE VIDEO OUT

10:05.600 --> 10:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, DOES IT MAKE IT MORE

10:07.067 --> 10:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT FOR COMMUNITIES TO

10:08.500 --> 10:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION OR DOES

10:11.133 --> 10:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT FIRST-- WHAT DOES IT DO IN

10:13.867 --> 10:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT KIND OF LARGER CONTEXT

10:17.567 --> 10:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING THESE INCREDIBLY

10:19.267 --> 10:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPASSIONED FLARE-UPS OCCUR?

10:20.867 --> 10:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE NO DEFINITIVE

10:22.433 --> 10:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNTS.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK HAVING THE VIDEO

10:25.867 --> 10:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVES SOME SOL AS TO PEOPLE IN

10:27.267 --> 10:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THIS SHOULD BE AN

10:29.467 --> 10:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBJECTIVE RECORD AND OFTEN IS

10:30.233 --> 10:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT MEANS THAT WE ARE REALLY

10:33.333 --> 10:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRASPING FOR SOMETHING TO SHOW

10:34.633 --> 10:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT

10:35.633 --> 10:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

10:36.900 --> 10:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT TRUST IN WHAT IS THE

10:38.933 --> 10:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE RECORD.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT IS THE SORT OF SIDE OF

10:42.700 --> 10:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT-- THE OFFICERS.

10:43.867 --> 10:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO EVEN WITH THE ADVANTAGE POINT

10:45.867 --> 10:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF BODY CAMERAS, THIS COMES

10:47.867 --> 10:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE YOU ARE SEEING IT FROM THE

10:49.533 --> 10:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE'S VAN TAJ POINT.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT FROM THAT OTHER

10:52.267 --> 10:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIZEN'S VAN TAJ POINT.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT

10:55.333 --> 10:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METAPHOR TO MEAN HOW DO WE GET

10:56.867 --> 10:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RECORD OF THE PEOPLE.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THEIR

10:59.967 --> 11:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNTS AND WHAT THEY GO

11:02.233 --> 11:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH.
