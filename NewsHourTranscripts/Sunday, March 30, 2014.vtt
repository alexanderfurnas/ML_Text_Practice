07:40.000 --> 07:41.433
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS AND NO

07:41.433 --> 07:44.267

07:44.267 --> 07:46.667
THAT SOME OF THE MENTAL LEGACY

07:46.667 --> 07:49.467
IS MORE THAN PTSD.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.500
YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS, TRYING TO

08:16.467 --> 08:20.700
THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT MUCH

08:20.700 --> 08:21.000
HIGHER

08:21.000 --> 08:23.467
THEY LOOK LIKE MOST AMERICAN

08:23.467 --> 08:27.500
FOR DEBT AND THE SAME FINANCIA

08:27.500 --> 08:27.767
STRUGGLES.

08:27.767 --> 08:29.300
>> DO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD

BE GIVEN A SPECIAL CHANCE IF

08:31.067 --> 08:32.367
THEY'RE UP FOR A JOB

08:32.367 --> 08:35.267

08:35.267 --> 08:36.733
ENTITLEMENT, I THINK IS ONE WORD

08:36.733 --> 08:37.533
FOR IT

08:37.533 --> 08:39.933
WHICH IS SOUNDER INTUITIVE T

08:39.933 --> 08:41.500

08:42.700 --> 08:46.267
MORE THAN 60% FEEL LIKE THEY

CONSIDERATION WHEN APPLYING FO

SHOULD BE GIVEN SPECIA

08:56.800 --> 08:57.167
CONSIDERATION.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.300
EXPERIENCE, THAT NUMBER WA

09:20.300 --> 09:24.367
REALLY SHOCKING, 69% SAY OFTEN

WHAT ARE THE SOLDIERS TELLIN

09:26.967 --> 09:27.167
YOU?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.733

09:29.733 --> 09:31.967
COMBAT, WHICH I THINK IS

09:31.967 --> 09:33.300
FUNDAMENTALLY DISLOCATING AN

09:33.300 --> 09:35.300
SOME OF IT IS THE WAY WE FOUGH

09:35.300 --> 09:36.133

09:36.133 --> 09:38.300
THIS IS THE LONGEST STRETCH IN

09:57.033 --> 09:58.567

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCEPT THAT WORKS

13:32.400 --> 13:34.500
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.933
THE IDEA IS TO GET PEOPLE TO

OFF, OR THERE IS TREATING A SICK

19:27.500 --> 19:30.167
ANIMAL, BUT THERE IS A LOT USED,

19:30.167 --> 19:34.367
AND MANY OF THEM OVERLAP WIT

ANTI-BIOTICS USED IN HUMAN

NOT USE THEM TO SPUR GROWTH,

19:40.067 --> 19:43.200
DOES THAT MEAN THEY CAN'T US

19:43.200 --> 19:45.367
THEM TO TREAT DISEASES

19:45.367 --> 19:49.767
>> NO, THEY CAN USE IT TO TREA

SOME CRITICS IN THE PAST SAY

20:05.100 --> 20:06.500
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT

20:06.500 --> 20:09.433
THEY'RE NOW SAYING THE DRUGS

CANNOT BE USED ROUTINELY I

FIELD TO PROMOTE GROWTH, BUT

20:16.400 --> 20:18.933
THEY CAN BE USED TO PREVEN
