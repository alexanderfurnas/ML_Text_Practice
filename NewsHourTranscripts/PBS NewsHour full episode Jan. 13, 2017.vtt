JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And I'm Steve
Inskeep.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
dividing lines.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine how some of the
president-elect's
Cabinet picks have put distance
between his

00:14.648 --> 00:16.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
views and their own.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Also ahead,:
President Obama
leaves office in a week, and we
examine his

00:19.052 --> 00:19.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
legacy in the Middle East.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the week's news.

00:24.992 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Plus, the
director of "Patriots
Day" tries to make a movie about
the Boston

00:28.428 --> 00:30.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marathon bombing the right way.

00:30.397 --> 00:34.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERG, Director, "Patriots
Day": It's
a responsibility for making sure
that we understand

00:34.868 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these acts of terrorism
don't achieve
what the terrorists think
they're going to

00:40.340 --> 00:41.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
achieve.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't destroy us.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't break us apart.

00:43.710 --> 00:51.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.118 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.987 --> 01:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Donald Trump
today renewed his efforts to
discredit reports

01:03.463 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Russia has compromising
information on
him.

01:06.700 --> 01:13.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Twitter, he said it's all --
quote -- "totally
made-up facts by sleazebag
political operatives."

01:13.240 --> 01:17.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said they were -- quote
-- "probably
released by intelligence'
agencies."

01:17.911 --> 01:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were new questions
about contacts
between Michael Flynn, Mr.
Trump's incoming

01:23.083 --> 01:26.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security adviser, and
Russia's ambassador
to the U.S.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will delve into that after
the news summary.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: That was part of
a busy morning
for the president-elect on
Twitter.

01:31.725 --> 01:36.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also said his one-time
opponent Hillary
Clinton was -- quote -- "guilty
as hell" and

01:36.496 --> 01:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the FBI was very nice to
her.

01:38.465 --> 01:43.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An inspector general is now
examining FBI
Director James Comey's public
statements about

01:43.370 --> 01:46.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his investigation of Clinton's
e-mails during
the campaign.

01:46.206 --> 01:51.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Justice
Department
charged today that Chicago's
police have been

01:51.178 --> 01:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violating people's rights for
years.

01:53.714 --> 01:58.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The federal agency found
widespread use of
excessive force and racial bias
against blacks

01:59.086 --> 02:00.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Latinos.

02:01.054 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Loretta
Lynch announced
the assessment in Chicago after
a year-long

02:05.359 --> 02:07.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
probe.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: Our
investigation found that this
pattern of practice

02:09.363 --> 02:15.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in no small part the result
of severely
deficient training procedures
and accountability

02:15.302 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
systems.

02:17.237 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't adequately review use
of force
incidents to determine whether
force was appropriate

02:21.675 --> 02:25.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or lawful, or whether the use of
force could
have been avoided altogether.

02:26.046 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chicago Mayor
Rahm Emanuel
called the findings sobering and
he pledged

02:31.051 --> 02:32.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new reforms.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: U.S. Marines may
finally get
help after drinking tainted
water at Camp

02:36.223 --> 02:37.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Lejeune.

02:37.891 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The case goes back to the 1980s
at the famous
training base in North Carolina.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Testing found contamination from
fuel tanks
and a dry cleaner.

02:45.098 --> 02:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of thousands of people
passed through
that base, and some developed
diseases like

02:49.403 --> 02:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leukemia, liver cancer, and
Parkinson's disease.

02:52.572 --> 02:55.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Department of Veterans
Affairs says it
will pay up to $2.2 billion.

02:56.076 --> 03:01.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Japanese
company Takata
will plead guilty in a federal
investigation

03:01.348 --> 03:07.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of its air bag inflators, and
pay $1 billion
in fines and restitution.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal prosecutors announced
the plea deal
in Detroit.

03:10.190 --> 03:15.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said three former
Takata executives
have been indicted for a
cover-up going back

03:15.529 --> 03:17.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to 2000.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA MCQUADE, U.S. Attorney:
They signed
and submitted false reports of
test data to

03:20.567 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their customers, and they
directed engineers
to falsify and manipulate data.

03:26.239 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even after the inflators began
to fail in
the field and injuries and
deaths were occurring,

03:31.344 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these Takata executives
continued to withhold
the true data from its
customers.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The defective
inflators can
explode with too much force.

03:40.053 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are blamed for 16 deaths
and 180 injuries
worldwide.

03:44.124 --> 03:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Today, the House
followed the
Senate in setting the stage for
repealing

03:48.328 --> 03:50.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers approved a rule which
allows big
parts of the law to be removed
with a simple

03:53.767 --> 03:55.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
majority in the Senate.

03:55.669 --> 03:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican majority still
has not agreed
on their long-promised
replacement for the

03:59.239 --> 04:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, which provides health
insurance for
millions.

04:02.109 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
had a fairly
quiet Friday the 13th.

04:06.179 --> 04:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost five
points to close at 19885.

04:10.851 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 26, and the S&amp;P
500 added
four.

04:16.289 --> 04:20.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how eight
years of Obama's foreign policy
shaped the

04:20.594 --> 04:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle East; Mark Shields and
David Brooks
on the week's news; Mark
Wahlberg's new film

04:26.099 --> 04:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recounting the Boston Marathon
bombing; and
much more.

04:35.876 --> 04:44.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: When
president-elect Trump
is inaugurated next week, he
inherits enormous

04:44.117 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During confirmation hearings for
his Cabinet
secretaries this week, senators
have taken

04:48.889 --> 04:52.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
steps to limit that power.

04:52.559 --> 04:56.730 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
They pressed the
president-elect's Cabinet
nominees to admit climate change
is real,

04:56.830 --> 05:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or that Russia is a threat, or
that torture
is illegal.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's still considered unlikely
that the Senate
will reject his nominees, but
senators are

05:05.338 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
setting terms of employment for
the administration
ahead.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The terms are often different
than what Mr.
Trump proposed while
campaigning.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.347 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I have
these guys, torture doesn't
work.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Believe me, it works, OK?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And water-boarding is your minor
form.

05:19.186 --> 05:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: That's what the
candidate said
in early 2016.

05:24.391 --> 05:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In early 2017, a Democratic
senator asked
Jeff Sessions, the nominee for
attorney general,

05:30.130 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if torture is legal.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS (R-AL), Attorney
General Nominee:
Congress has taken an action now
that makes

05:35.235 --> 05:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it absolutely improper and
illegal to use
water-boarding or any other form
of torture

05:42.943 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States by our
military and by
all our other departments and
agencies.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Sessions
effectively committed
himself to telling the president
the U.S.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can't do that.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elaine Kamarck has written a
book on the presidency.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAINE KAMARCK, Former Senior
Adviser to Former
Vice President Al Gore: This is
the United

05:58.024 --> 06:03.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
States Senate reminding
president-elect Trump
that there is a Constitution,
and the Constitution

06:03.797 --> 06:09.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has divided powers in it, and
that we are
a government of laws, not men.

06:09.736 --> 06:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: A president can
override the
attorney general, but it can be
politically

06:15.342 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
costly.

06:17.143 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 1973, Richard Nixon's
attorney general
resigned, rather than follow his
orders during

06:21.615 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Watergate.

06:23.450 --> 06:28.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2004, George W. Bush's
attorney general,
John Ashcroft, rejected a secret
wiretapping

06:28.388 --> 06:30.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, senators are asking
nominees if
they're ready to push back
against the president's

06:34.394 --> 06:35.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
promises.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect has scorned
the Iran nuclear
deal.

06:39.165 --> 06:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Never, never,
ever, in my life
have I seen any transaction so
incompetently

06:47.240 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiated as our deal with
Iran.

06:50.443 --> 06:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: His choice for
defense secretary,
James Mattis, was skeptical too,
but told

06:54.781 --> 06:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senators he favors keeping it.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS (RET.), Secretary
of Defense
Nominee: Sir, I think it is an
imperfect arms

06:59.552 --> 07:00.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
control agreement.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a friendship treaty.

07:03.256 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when America gives her word,
we have to
live up to it and work with our
allies.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Some of the same
allies work
with the United States on
climate change.

07:11.965 --> 07:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
cancel the Paris
climate agreement and stop all
payments of

07:19.673 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States tax dollars to
U.N. global
warming programs.

07:24.010 --> 07:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Rex Tillerson,
the choice for
secretary of state, said he'd
rather not walk

07:27.914 --> 07:29.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
away from this issue.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, Secretary of
State Nominee:
I think it's important that the
United States

07:31.918 --> 07:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maintain its seat at the table
on the conversations
around how to address threats of
climate change,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which do require a global
response.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one country is going to solve
this alone.

07:42.662 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: This afternoon,
the president-elect
said he's not concerned about
these different

07:46.366 --> 07:47.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
views.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, that all gets
straightened
out.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want them to be themselves,
and I told
them, be yourselves and say what
you want

07:52.472 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't worry about me.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: But Paul Light,
who studies
presidential transitions, has
rarely seen

07:58.945 --> 08:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much daylight between a chief
executive
and his nominees.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL LIGHT, New York University:
They are
setting themselves up for
scrutiny.

08:05.719 --> 08:11.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they violate their own
promises to the
Senate, it creates an issue with
the president.

08:11.758 --> 08:16.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate isn't going to come
in impeach
and a Cabinet secretary.

08:16.396 --> 08:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the media and outside groups
will put
pressure on the president to
force the resignation

08:23.503 --> 08:25.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or change his own policy.

08:25.905 --> 08:31.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: The Senate
hearings have also
reflected some senators'
anxieties about this

08:31.277 --> 08:32.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon:
Congressman, during
the campaign, the
president-elect essentially

08:36.082 --> 08:39.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laid out something that looks to
me like outsourcing
surveillance.

08:39.586 --> 08:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Consider the
hearing for Congressman
Mike Pompeo, now the nominee to
run the CIA.

08:45.458 --> 08:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon's Ron Wyden asked if the
new president
might receive surveillance
information on

08:50.196 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans gathered by Russia.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE POMPEO (R), Kansas: It is
not lawful
to outsource that which we
cannot do under

08:56.369 --> 08:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- the agency cannot do under
its laws.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That can be too clever by half.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON WYDEN: But that's not the
question.

09:03.676 --> 09:04.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't request the
information from a foreign
government.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We understand that.

09:06.780 --> 09:11.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the question is, what
happens if it's
provided to you, especially
since it's being

09:11.718 --> 09:12.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
encouraged?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE POMPEO: Senator, my
understanding is
that the same set of rules that
surround the

09:17.357 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information if it were collected
by the U.S.
government apply to information
that becomes

09:22.762 --> 09:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
available as a result of
collection from non-U.S.
sources as well.

09:26.533 --> 09:30.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Scholar Elaine
Kamarck, a Democrat
who's been critical of the
president-elect,

09:30.904 --> 09:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ended this week of hearings
feeling better.

09:32.872 --> 09:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAINE KAMARCK: I think the
nominees, in their
disagreements with Trump, what
they are doing

09:37.811 --> 09:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, they are saying, almost
uniformly, we
will abide by the laws of the
land.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's pretty good.

09:45.485 --> 09:52.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if, down the road, the
Congress wants
to change the laws of the land
well, we elected

09:52.559 --> 09:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, and that is what we have
got.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: The nominees do
not differ
from the president on
everything.

09:58.298 --> 10:03.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elaine Chao, the choice for
transportation
secretary, said she will support
the president-elect's

10:03.102 --> 10:05.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plan to buy American.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELAINE CHAO, Secretary of
Transportation-Designate:
It is his policy, and, of
course, all Cabinet

10:07.774 --> 10:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
members will follow his policy.

10:09.742 --> 10:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Even though Chao
once wrote
that it was like digging a moat
around America.

10:14.547 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be only one president
of the United
States, and his name will be
Trump.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, both the House and
Senate have
passed the waiver for General
Mattis to serve

10:25.191 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as secretary of defense.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It awaits the president's
signature.

10:28.528 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, as we heard, Russia has
loomed over this
week of hearings.

10:32.699 --> 10:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Columnist David Ignatius has
been compiling
unanswered questions about each
of the players.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is at The Washington Post.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, David, first the
president-elect.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the question on your mind
about Trump?

10:42.208 --> 10:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS, Columnist, The
Washington
Post: Well, we had a week in
which Trump,

10:45.612 --> 10:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not surprisingly, pushed back on
unsubstantiated
allegations that were made.

10:51.084 --> 10:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we need to know about Trump
and the Russian
hacking effort is, was there any
connection,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what's true and what isn't?

10:59.359 --> 11:03.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump is right to say we
shouldn't listen
to fake news or rumor.

11:04.063 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need an investigation in
Congress and I
think also by the FBI to
establish what is

11:09.102 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
true and not.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: What are your
questions about
contacts between the president
or his staff

11:14.073 --> 11:15.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Russia?

11:16.009 --> 11:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Well, I wrote
something that
was, I think, new this morning,
saying that

11:20.680 --> 11:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's choice for national
security adviser,
General Michael Flynn, had been
in contact

11:26.686 --> 11:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russian ambassador,
Sergey Kislyak,
around the time, I said on the
day of, but

11:33.726 --> 11:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was the day before,
the announcement
of sanctions against Russia,
expulsion of

11:38.965 --> 11:40.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
35 diplomats.

11:40.833 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump campaign today
confirmed that, yes,
indeed, there had been a
conversation between

11:46.172 --> 11:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Flynn and Kislyak on December
28.

11:49.208 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the day that it was in
almost every
major news outlet that sanctions
were on the

11:53.746 --> 11:55.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post had actually
written the
day before that they were
coming.

11:57.417 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The question is, was it
appropriate to be
talking about future policies,
future conversations

12:02.422 --> 12:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Trump and Putin on the
day that the
Obama administration was trying
to impose

12:07.160 --> 12:08.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Because you can't
have two
presidents at a time, of course,
and President

12:10.530 --> 12:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama is still the president at
this moment.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Precisely.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Now, you also
have a question
about President Obama.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: So, there is a
question.

12:16.636 --> 12:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the more we know about
Russian hacking,
we legitimately ask, why didn't
President

12:21.307 --> 12:23.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama do more to stop it?

12:23.209 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why didn't -- in the now we
realize months
in which the FBI, our
intelligence agencies

12:28.381 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were looking at this threat, why
didn't the
administration take stronger
steps?

12:33.052 --> 12:38.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the administration is
the White House
was genuinely worried that if it
took steps,

12:38.224 --> 12:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it might escalate into much
sharper Russian
action that could actually
disrupt the election,

12:46.332 --> 12:48.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even the process of counting
votes on Election
Day.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And what's your
question about
Russia?

12:51.270 --> 12:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Well, I tried in
my last question
to think the way a
counterintelligence analyst

12:58.444 --> 13:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the CIA would think, looking
at this kind
of evidence.

13:02.882 --> 13:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it possible that the Russians
wanted this
information to come out, wanted
the unsubstantiated,

13:10.189 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
salacious information in the
dossier compiled
by a former British intelligence
officer to

13:15.028 --> 13:16.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come out?

13:17.063 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the real goal that Russia has
had all along
to destabilize the American
political environment,

13:22.935 --> 13:24.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our political system?

13:24.937 --> 13:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you need to look at
every piece of
this with the most skeptical
eye.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Who would you
trust, David
Ignatius, to answer those
questions?

13:32.311 --> 13:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Well, we have
institutions.

13:34.981 --> 13:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what our system is about.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would trust the Congress.

13:37.450 --> 13:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would trust a bipartisan
select committee
of the House and Senate.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would certainly trust our law
enforcement
agencies.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have experienced U.S.
attorneys.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have FBI investigators.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have intelligence officers.

13:52.098 --> 13:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they ought to do this,
they ought
to do it in their own time, in
secret.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not something to be hashed
out in the
press every day.

14:01.908 --> 14:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think we need answers,
we need to
know what's true and what isn't.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: David Ignatius at
The Washington
Post, thanks very much.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Thank you.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And just moments
ago, the Trump
transition team said that
incoming National

14:13.419 --> 14:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Adviser Michael Flynn
also spoke
with the Russian ambassador on
December 29.

14:19.325 --> 14:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the day the new sanctions
were announced.

14:25.331 --> 14:37.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Looking at
President Obama,
he came into office with a
desire to wind

14:37.477 --> 14:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down America's wars overseas and
step up the
focus at home, but events had a
way of intervening,

14:43.816 --> 14:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
especially in the Middle East.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we take stock of the
president's
record in that volatile region.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner begins our look.

14:51.624 --> 14:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Shortly after
taking office,
President Obama traveled to
Egypt to address

14:58.030 --> 14:59.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Islamic world.

15:00.032 --> 15:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I have come here to Cairo to
seek a new beginning

15:03.169 --> 15:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the United States and
Muslims around
the world, one based on mutual
interest and

15:09.275 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mutual respect.

15:11.144 --> 15:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yet, eight
years later, the
broader Middle East is a far
more volatile

15:15.715 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place than it was.

15:18.117 --> 15:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scholar Vali Nasr joined the
administration
to deal with Afghanistan and
Pakistan.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now dean of the Johns
Hopkins School
of Advanced International
Studies.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR, Dean, School of
Advanced International
Studies, Johns Hopkins
University: I think

15:28.060 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama came to office
with quite
fundamental understandings in
his mind about

15:34.000 --> 15:36.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's possible and what's not
possible in
the Middle East.

15:36.669 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The first, I would say,
revolutionary breakthrough
that he introduced is that the
Middle East

15:43.109 --> 15:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't matter to American
geostrategy as
much as we think.

15:47.914 --> 15:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That view
colored the president's
approach to making good on two
of his campaign

15:52.785 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promises: ending the U.S. war in
Iraq, and
investing more military
resources to Afghanistan,

16:00.193 --> 16:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the Taliban was regaining
ground.

16:03.796 --> 16:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, the military
reportedly wanted
up to 80,000 more troops, on top
of the tens

16:09.135 --> 16:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thousands already there, to
mount an Iraq-like
counterinsurgency campaign.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president ordered a review
of the entire
approach.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michele Flournoy was the
undersecretary for
policy at the Defense
Department.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE FLOURNOY, Former Defense
Department
Official: There was a tug-of-war
between people

16:25.384 --> 16:32.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who had very ambitious,
transformational goals
in Afghanistan, and those who
argued for what

16:32.925 --> 16:37.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was sort of a good enough
solution for Afghanistan
and for achieving our limited
objectives.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And did the
president come
to that, as it was known, Afghan
good-enough

16:42.034 --> 16:42.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
objective?

16:43.035 --> 16:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE FLOURNOY: Yes, I think
he did.

16:46.038 --> 16:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In December
2009, Mr. Obama
announced 30,000 more U.S.
troops for Afghanistan

16:53.079 --> 16:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pledged that, in 18 months,
they would
start coming home.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nasr believes Afghanistan marked
a pivot point
for him.

17:00.653 --> 17:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR: President Obama
started by accepting
the military's
counterinsurgency, but came

17:07.894 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
out of Afghanistan having
decided that counterinsurgency
actually doesn't work.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Instead, the
U.S. turned
to counterterrorism, relying
more on drones

17:17.970 --> 17:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and special forces to target
terrorists.

17:20.406 --> 17:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In May 2011, that strategy
produced a fateful
raid on a compound in
Abbottabad, Pakistan.

17:26.946 --> 17:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The United States
has conducted
an operation that killed Osama
bin Laden,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the leader of al-Qaida.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: To fulfill a
second campaign
promise, the president moved
briskly to withdraw

17:37.957 --> 17:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. forces from Iraq, ending
the U.S. combat
mission in 2010.

17:43.996 --> 17:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Negotiations to leave even a
residual force
foundered in a dispute with
Iraqi Prime Minister

17:48.601 --> 17:50.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nouri al-Maliki.

17:50.503 --> 17:56.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHELE FLOURNOY: When we
removed our forces,
we lost our ability to reassure
Maliki, to

17:56.208 --> 18:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
influence Maliki, and, absent
that reassurance,
he took a very hard turn towards
sectarianism.

18:03.783 --> 18:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In early 2011,
the Arab spring
exploded.

18:08.854 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first targets was a
longtime U.S.
ally, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.

18:14.493 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
After failing to persuade
Mubarak to plan
his own exit, Mr. Obama spoke.

18:18.898 --> 18:25.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: An orderly
transition must be
meaningful, it must be peaceful,
and it must

18:25.171 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
begin now.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Derek Chollet
was a top official
in both the State and Defense
Departments

18:30.276 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under President Obama.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK CHOLLET, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of Defense: The calculation was,
if Mubarak's

18:34.180 --> 18:40.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to go anyway, what
position are we going
to put ourselves in to be able
to take advantage

18:40.553 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or have any influence in a
post-Mubarak Egypt?

18:42.588 --> 18:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In Syria,
peaceful protests
in early 2011 against President
Bashar al-Assad

18:48.461 --> 18:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exploded into a full-blown civil
war.

18:51.597 --> 18:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In August, Mr. Obama said it was
time for
Assad to step aside.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But he resisted giving
mainstream rebels the
weapons they needed.

19:00.006 --> 19:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Derek Chollet said the chaos
that followed
the limited U.S. intervention in
Libya's uprising

19:05.444 --> 19:07.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
affected the president's
approach to Syria.

19:07.847 --> 19:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK CHOLLET: The initial
questions were
about, who was the Syrian
opposition, how

19:11.817 --> 19:16.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can we be sure that the
capabilities we provide
them don't end up in the wrong
hands?

19:16.489 --> 19:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That gave the
upper hand
to Assad's forces and Islamist
fighters.

19:20.960 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, asked what could prompt
U.S. action
in Syria, the president issued a
now infamous

19:28.000 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
warning.

19:29.935 --> 19:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: A red line for us
is, we start
seeing a whole bunch of chemical
weapons moving

19:34.106 --> 19:35.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around or being utilized.

19:35.908 --> 19:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One year later,
Assad's forces
killed 1,400 people in a
chemical weapons

19:40.679 --> 19:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attack on a Damascus suburb.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plans were set for the U.S. and
French to
strike.

19:46.719 --> 19:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, suddenly, President Obama
announced he
would seek congressional
approval first.

19:51.157 --> 19:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: While I believe I
have the authority
to carry out this military
action without

19:56.095 --> 20:01.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
specific congressional
authorization, I know
that the country will be
stronger if we take

20:01.734 --> 20:03.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this course.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: With no action
by Congress,
Secretary of State John Kerry,
working with

20:06.605 --> 20:13.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Russian counterpart, Sergei
Lavrov, pressured
Assad to surrender the chemical
weapons stockpile.

20:13.112 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michele Flournoy said the move
shook U.S.
credibility in the minds of some
allies.

20:17.416 --> 20:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE FLOURNOY: I personally
had allies
from Asia on my doorstep the
next day, asking

20:23.923 --> 20:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Syria and the red line
meant for our
guarantees to them.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This week,
Kerry heatedly
defended the choice.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Would
it have been better to bomb them
for two days

20:35.067 --> 20:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not get all the weapons out,
and today
those weapons would be in the
hands of ISIL?

20:39.572 --> 20:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Kerry spent two
years with
Lavrov trying to get Assad and
the rebels

20:44.043 --> 20:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a political settlement.

20:45.845 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, 16 months ago, Russia
launched heavy
airstrikes in Syria to shore up
Assad.

20:52.351 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last month, with up to
half-a-million
dead, and a refugee crisis
swamping Europe,

20:57.857 --> 21:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. was on the sidelines as
Russia and
Turkey negotiated a fragile
cease-fire.

21:06.132 --> 21:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this conflict also generated
a new threat,
the Islamic State.

21:10.436 --> 21:16.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2013, remnants of the
once-defeated al-Qaida
in Iraq moved into ungoverned
territory in

21:16.976 --> 21:18.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

21:18.711 --> 21:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They declared the Syrian city of
Raqqa as
their capital, then swept back
into Iraq,

21:23.315 --> 21:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capturing swathes of Sunni
territory.

21:25.784 --> 21:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In January 2014, President Obama
dismissed
is as a J.V. basketball team.

21:32.358 --> 21:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after ISIS took Iraq's
second largest
city, Mosul, and threatened
Iraqi Kurdistan,

21:37.730 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. began airstrikes.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The bombing campaign soon
expanded into Syria.

21:42.701 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I can announce
that America
will lead a broad coalition to
roll back this

21:48.107 --> 21:49.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorist threat.

21:50.042 --> 21:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: He would later
add U.S. special
forces, trainers and some troops
in Iraq and

21:54.413 --> 21:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syria, where they remain today.

21:57.883 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One goal President Obama
fulfilled was to
sideline Iran's progress towards
a nuclear

22:02.988 --> 22:04.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapon.

22:04.857 --> 22:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years of negotiations among
Iran, the
U.S. and other world powers
produced a deal

22:09.228 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2015.

22:11.263 --> 22:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama struck the deal over
strong objections
from Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,

22:17.636 --> 22:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adding to tensions between the
two over other
issues.

22:21.106 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brookings institution scholar
Shadi Hamid
credits Mr. Obama for the Iran
deal, but says:

22:27.279 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHADI HAMID, Brookings
Institution: I don't
remember ever hearing a real,
live Arab say

22:32.651 --> 22:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Iran's nuclear program was
their number
one concern or priority.

22:38.057 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: He also
believes the apparent
trade-off, making the U.S.
reluctant to enter

22:42.528 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fray in Syria, where Iran
was helping
Assad, wasn't worth it.

22:46.932 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHADI HAMID: In the Middle East,
we have learned
everything is interconnected,
and if we do

22:51.604 --> 22:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one thing in one area, it can
come at the
cost of something else.

22:55.975 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One week from
today, dealing
with that web of conflicts will
fall to a

23:00.779 --> 23:03.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new commander in chief.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

23:05.884 --> 23:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on this
part of the
president's foreign policy
legacy, we turn

23:10.155 --> 23:15.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to three guests with deep
experience managing
national security policy and, in
some cases,

23:15.628 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting the United States'
wars.

23:18.230 --> 23:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Retired General David Petraeus
commanded American
forces in Iraq, in Afghanistan,
and for the

23:23.836 --> 23:25.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entire Middle East.

23:25.604 --> 23:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also served as President
Obama's director
of the CIA, a post he resigned
in 2012.

23:31.477 --> 23:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Eric Edelman, he
served in a variety
of senior positions at the
Departments of

23:35.714 --> 23:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State and Defense, as well as
the White House,
and was a national security aide
for Vice

23:41.120 --> 23:42.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Dick Cheney.

23:43.055 --> 23:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Philip Gordon, he served in
the State
Department under President
Clinton and President

23:47.793 --> 23:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama, and he served as the
senior-most official

on Mr. Obama's

23:52.898 --> 23:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Security Council staff
from 2013
to 2015.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, we welcome all three
of you to
the program.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a complicated region.

24:02.207 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot to cover, but
let's focus on
three countries.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
General Petraeus, to you first.

24:07.179 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq, how do you size up the
legacy of this
president, President Obama, in
Iraq?

24:12.851 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), Former
CIA Director:
I think it's mixed.

24:16.288 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, the developments of
the last couple
of years, when we have responded
to the actions

24:21.126 --> 24:26.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the Islamic State, has
gathered a considerable
amount of momentum and actually
taken back

24:26.632 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Islamic State all but
one of the
major cities, which is likely to
fall in the

24:31.403 --> 24:33.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weeks and months ahead.

24:33.339 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, prior to that, of course,
there was a
pulling out of our forces,
various explanations

24:38.977 --> 24:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that and whether that would
have, if we
had been able to keep them,
could have given

24:42.915 --> 24:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us the influence to prevent the
ruinous course
that Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki pursued

24:48.087 --> 24:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that became highly sectarian and
created the
fertile fields for the planting
of the seeds

24:52.291 --> 24:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of extremism that the Islamic
State exploited,
before drifting into Syria and
gaining lots

24:59.198 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of power in that civil war.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Edelman, how do
you see the president's legacy
in Iraq?

25:03.602 --> 25:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC EDELMAN, Former State
Department and
Defense Department Official: I
see it largely

25:04.903 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a lost opportunity.

25:06.872 --> 25:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When General Petraeus and our
mutual colleague
Ambassador Ryan Crocker
negotiated the agreement

25:14.313 --> 25:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2008, I think all of us
anticipated there
would be a residual U.S. force
staying after

25:19.551 --> 25:22.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
December 31, 2011.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we would have had
more influence,
we would have been better able
to help prevent

25:27.092 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rise of ISIS had we kept a
residual force
there.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And was that a
mistake?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of State: Well, I think you have
to remember

25:33.432 --> 25:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the situation at the time.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On balance, would it have been
nice to have
a residual force?

25:37.503 --> 25:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think the answer is yes.

25:39.171 --> 25:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also happens to be the case
that the Iraqis
very much wanted us to leave.

25:43.175 --> 25:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Bush administration had
agreed that we
would leave by 2011, U.S. forces
shall leave

25:48.781 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Obama was presented with
a situation
where you have the Iraqis asking
us to leave,

25:53.652 --> 25:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. public not wanting to
say, the Iraqi
parliament refusing to give the
immunities

25:58.190 --> 25:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would need for our forces to
stay.

26:00.058 --> 26:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while it would have been
nice to have,
you can't pretend that the
president, that

26:04.696 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama could have just
somehow come
in and said, all right, we're
staying whether

26:07.299 --> 26:09.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you like it or not.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that sense, one, it's kind of
a moot point
whether it would have been nice,
because it

26:12.771 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wasn't possible.

26:14.673 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, two, I doubt, even though I
would have
rather seen some forces, that
even a residual

26:19.144 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. force, 5,000, 10,000, would
have been
enough to stop the very powerful
trends that

26:25.417 --> 26:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going on in Iraq in terms
of sectarianism,
the rise of ISIS which was
emerging from Syria,

26:30.289 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and all sorts of other things.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, it would have been
nice, but we should
remember the context in which
the president...

26:35.327 --> 26:36.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:36.328 --> 26:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see...

26:37.329 --> 26:38.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:38.330 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

26:40.199 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: One of the
paradoxes now is
that we now have nearly 6,000
troops on the

26:40.599 --> 26:41.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ground.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we do not have a
parliament...

26:42.734 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: We do not a
parliamentary-agreed
status of forces agreement.

26:47.406 --> 26:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, it's just one of the
ironies, the terrible
ironies of a country that has
suffered so

26:51.643 --> 26:53.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You want to
button this up
before we turn to another
country?

26:54.880 --> 26:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC EDELMAN: Well, General
Petraeus made
the point I was going to make.

26:57.483 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we could have made a
more serious
effort with the Iraqis.

27:03.622 --> 27:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they detected what
Philip was talking
about, which is that the
president really

27:09.027 --> 27:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have his heart in it and
that the American
people were tired of a long and
difficult

27:14.233 --> 27:15.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn to
Afghanistan,
Phil Gordon.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you size up what the
president -- you
were in the middle of all this.

27:19.104 --> 27:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you size up what the
president did,
has done in Afghanistan?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: On Iraq, General
Petraeus said
mixed.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think mixed would probably be
our answer
for a lot of these questions

27:29.548 --> 27:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in Afghanistan,
that is probably
the right assessment there as
well.

27:33.285 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can't be better than mixed
because Afghanistan
is hugely dysfunctional.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Taliban are still there.

27:39.224 --> 27:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when the president
decided early
on to surge, he wanted to surge,
he just wanted

27:43.262 --> 27:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with that threat and
frankly get out
and get out completely.

27:46.632 --> 27:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the government is still
dysfunctional
and fractured, the Taliban is
there, and we're

27:50.836 --> 27:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not able to get out completely.

27:53.338 --> 27:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not positive for all of
those reasons,
but it's also not terrible,
because we have

27:59.578 --> 28:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achieved the minimal, which is
keeping the
government in Kabul in place and
fending off,

28:04.116 --> 28:05.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if you will, the Taliban.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General Petraeus.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: And if you
remember, the reason
we went to Afghanistan and the
reason we have

28:09.922 --> 28:14.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stayed is to ensure that
Afghanistan is not
once again a sanctuary for
al-Qaida or other

28:14.493 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transnational extremists, the
way it was when
the 9/11 attacks were planned
there and the

28:19.331 --> 28:22.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
initial training of the
attackers was conducted
there.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have accomplished that
mission to date.

28:24.770 --> 28:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, we have had to keep forces
on the ground
somewhere in the neighborhood of
10,000 or

28:29.942 --> 28:30.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That wasn't the president's
plan.

28:32.811 --> 28:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we should give him
credit for backing
off the plan of pulling them all
out, which

28:36.114 --> 28:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have unhinged the country,
and give
some credit to the Afghans as
well that they

28:40.953 --> 28:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are very much shouldering the
burden of fighting
and in many cases dying for
their country.

28:45.724 --> 28:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is a very challenged,
troubled, difficult
country, and has been throughout
its history.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Edelman, Afghanistan?

28:53.966 --> 28:58.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC EDELMAN: I largely agree
with what both
Philip and General Petraeus have
said.

28:58.503 --> 29:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say that I think the
president's decision
to set a timeline at the outset
of the surge

29:05.177 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Afghanistan...

29:06.178 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Publicly.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIC EDELMAN: Publicly --
created difficulties
that made it, I think, a harder
row to hoe

29:11.049 --> 29:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for General Petraeus and General
Allen and
others who succeeded them.

29:16.188 --> 29:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I -- like General Petraeus, I
give the president
enormous credit for reversing
himself and

29:20.559 --> 29:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not insisting on a complete
withdrawal during
his time in office.

29:24.596 --> 29:30.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I do think the new
administration is going
to be facing a very tough
situation.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I agree with General
Petraeus.

29:32.137 --> 29:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to keep in mind that the
reason we
went there to begin with is not
to allow it

29:36.241 --> 29:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a kind of petri dish for
Islamic extremism
that seeks to attack the United
States.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: And my hope
would be that
there could be a sustained
commitment at,

29:47.486 --> 29:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, a modest level that is a
sustainable
strategy in terms of...

29:53.325 --> 29:54.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:54.493 --> 29:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean in the

29:55.327 --> 29:56.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Yes.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General Petraeus,
you told
us that Syria, the last place I
want to ask

30:02.000 --> 30:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you all about, is a place in
which history
is going to judge this
administration most

30:04.536 --> 30:05.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
harshly.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

30:06.538 --> 30:08.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Well, I think
what's happened
in Syria is that we have had
rhetoric that

30:11.209 --> 30:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has not, in the end, been backed
up by resources
and commitment, Bashar must go,
a red line

30:22.721 --> 30:25.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
discussion of what a
humanitarian catastrophe
it was.

30:25.590 --> 30:31.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the end of the day, we
haven't made
the very, very difficult -- and,
again, there

30:31.363 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are no easy choices about Syria.

30:33.398 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was at the table.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were never guarantees.

30:36.501 --> 30:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we didn't take the very
tough decisions
that could have given us a
chance in some

30:41.740 --> 30:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these cases, and where you're
pretty certain
that if there wasn't a decision
or not sufficient

30:48.580 --> 30:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resources, that it wasn't going
to succeed,
in the way that we defined
success at the

30:54.086 --> 30:55.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

30:55.954 --> 30:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Phil Gordon, why
was President
Obama right not to retaliate, do
something

30:59.758 --> 31:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a military nature after
President Assad
crossed that red line?

31:04.329 --> 31:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: Well, I actually
think he should
have done something of a
military nature after

31:07.799 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he crossed that red line.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was about chemical weapons.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he said, if they used
chemical weapons,
he would respond.

31:13.472 --> 31:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think we should
confuse that with
the broader question of using
military force

31:17.776 --> 31:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to achieve our broader goals in
Syria, like
getting rid of the Assad regime.

31:21.980 --> 31:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there, if your question is
why was he
right, I think people should be
very careful

31:26.818 --> 31:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to assume there was some
modest use of
military force that would have
achieved the

31:32.424 --> 31:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objective of getting rid of the
regime and
putting moderates in charge of a
stable Syria.

31:37.295 --> 31:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that sense, I think General
Petraeus is
right that there was a gap
between the rhetoric,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ends and the means.

31:43.702 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the critique that somehow,
if only the
president had given more arms to
the opposition

31:49.207 --> 31:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or set up a no-fly zone, that
gap would have
been closed, I disagree with.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Edelman?

31:56.114 --> 32:00.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIC EDELMAN: Well, the
administration's argument
for inaction in Syria was that
doing some

32:00.118 --> 32:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the things that Philip just
suggested would
lead to greater violence,
greater extremism,

32:04.823 --> 32:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more radicalization, and in
general a worse
humanitarian situation in Syria.

32:10.862 --> 32:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, there are consequences
to inaction
as well.

32:14.132 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the inaction that we saw, I
think, has
led to a catastrophic situation,
half-a-million

32:20.005 --> 32:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people killed, 11 million people
displaced,
a migration crisis that is
overwhelming the

32:26.278 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institutions of Europe, our
closest allies.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do think -- I agree with
General Petraeus.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in retrospect, when
people judge
this administration
historically, it will

32:34.619 --> 32:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be seen as the biggest stain on
this administration's
record.

32:36.955 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: I think that
summary of the
consequences of inaction is fair
and accurate.

32:41.593 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one who was involved with
this policy would
disagree that the consequences
of the road

32:47.065 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
traveled were poor.

32:49.034 --> 32:55.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, again, we have to be
careful not to assume
that the alternative course of
action, using

32:55.941 --> 33:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military force, for example,
would have had
led to a better set of
circumstances.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would be different
circumstances.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: I do think we
have to be a
little careful not to say that
it was either

33:06.418 --> 33:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this or either that, that it was
either all-out
military action to get rid of
Bashar or it

33:12.591 --> 33:14.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was nothing.

33:14.392 --> 33:18.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I do think there were
alternatives, as have
been discussed by the
participants.

33:18.396 --> 33:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, no guarantee that they
would have succeeded,
but it's hard to imagine the
situation could

33:24.069 --> 33:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be worse than it is right now.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
we're going to
be debating all three of these
places we have

33:28.907 --> 33:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked about just now and the
rest of that
part of the world for a long
time to come.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, we thank all of you for
being here,
General David Petraeus,
Ambassador Eric Edelman,

33:35.247 --> 33:36.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Philip Gordon.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Pleasure.

33:38.216 --> 33:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: Good to be here.

33:40.752 --> 33:51.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

33:53.398 --> 33:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

33:58.136 --> 33:59.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

34:00.005 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is so much to talk about,
but let's
start with talking about the
president-elect

34:03.642 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Russia.

34:05.477 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had the news today -- on top
of all the
confirmation that the Russians
interfered

34:08.813 --> 34:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. election, today, we
learned -- and
we talked about earlier it on
the show -- David,

34:12.384 --> 34:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that General Michael Flynn had
phone conversations
with the Russian ambassador in
December, several

34:18.223 --> 34:20.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of them.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we're learning that the
Senate Intelligence
Committee is going to expand
what was already

34:23.528 --> 34:29.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an investigation into the
Russian interference
into in election to look at any
contacts between

34:29.234 --> 34:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign and the
Russians and the
Clinton campaign, although the
main focus

34:33.805 --> 34:34.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Donald Trump.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we make of all this?

34:36.741 --> 34:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I was first struck
by David
Ignatius' comment earlier in the
program that

34:39.477 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they just could be trying to be
destabilize
the United States across the
board.

34:43.548 --> 34:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a -- I hadn't heard
that thought
before and it's a live
possibility.

34:47.886 --> 34:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin is someone who has been
undermining
the norms of what we consider
the world order

34:52.390 --> 34:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since he got into power and in
increasing
success.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting about the
Trump administration
is how bitterly divided they are
in their

34:58.596 --> 35:00.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attitudes towards Putin.

35:00.865 --> 35:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Steve Bannon and General Flynn
have warm feelings.

35:05.070 --> 35:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin has been -- and with a lot
of the groups,
the conservative groups, the
more extreme

35:09.541 --> 35:13.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
conservative groups that
underlie Trump, he's
a bit of a hero because he
speaks for traditional

35:13.611 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
values, he's against the global
institutions.

35:16.881 --> 35:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see him as someone who has
been on the
defensive from an aggressive
E.U., an aggressive

35:20.785 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
NATO.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is a lot of sympathy
there, actually.

35:23.922 --> 35:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, if you look at the
more establishment
Republicans, they see him as
what I just described,

35:28.226 --> 35:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subversive of the world order.

35:30.128 --> 35:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so to me the question will
be, will Trump
and Bannon control policy toward
the foreign

35:34.232 --> 35:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy, or will everyone else
basically?

35:37.469 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my money is on everyone
else, because
I think Trump's attention span
is super low.

35:43.274 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't think he has the
expertise to actually
run a foreign policy.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the end of the day -- and
I think this
is a major story of the Trump
administration

35:48.980 --> 35:53.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- he's going to want the
affirmation of the
establishment, as he always has.

35:54.052 --> 35:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason he had Clintons at
his wedding
because he wants that
affirmation.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he gets the chance to have
it, I think
he will bend gradually in that
direction.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How are you
looking at all
this?

36:02.327 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Donald Trump is to
traditional
values what I am to marathon
running.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:07.866 --> 36:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It just doesn't --
it doesn't
fit.

36:09.667 --> 36:14.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have to say, Judy, I am
perplexed, and I
think an increasing number of
Republicans

36:14.739 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are perplexed and actually
nervous about Donald
Trump and Russia, nervous in the
sense that

36:22.147 --> 36:26.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he is gratuitously giving
Democrats the national
security advantage, that they're
standing

36:26.885 --> 36:28.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up for the country.

36:28.853 --> 36:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have testimony of General
Mattis, the nominee
for secretary of defense,
asserting that the

36:34.826 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objective, the stated objective
and the mission
of Vladimir Putin's Russia is to
destabilize

36:42.100 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the North Atlantic Alliance, and
he, who believes
in NATO and believes it's been
one of the

36:48.873 --> 36:57.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
great alliances in modern
history, that Putin
represents a threat to this,
that Russia today

36:58.083 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is nothing but a propaganda arm,
that General
Flynn went to celebrate its
anniversary, sitting

37:03.021 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Putin's table for money, paid
to show up.

37:07.992 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, these questions,
essentially,
they have just given it to the
Democrats to

37:12.630 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand up and say, wait a minute,
where do
you believe in this country,
plus the suspicions,

37:16.768 --> 37:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and real, about in fact the
involvement of
Russia in this election.

37:22.674 --> 37:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question, the real moment of
truth is
going to arrive very shortly, a
couple of

37:26.911 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks, when sanctions arrive on
Donald Trump's
-- President Donald Trump's desk
passed by

37:31.616 --> 37:33.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Republican Congress.

37:33.651 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is he going to oppose those
sanctions?

37:36.187 --> 37:37.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's he going to do?

37:37.722 --> 37:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think it's inexplicable
and irrational,
his policy on Russia.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would say it's a
theory.

37:45.964 --> 37:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got a theory of it, which
is the theory
of UKIP in the United Kingdom,
the theory

37:51.269 --> 37:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Le Pen in France, which is
that the global
establishment has basically
failed people,

37:57.108 --> 38:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that, all around the world
-- it's a little
like Marxism in reverse --
global movement

38:01.312 --> 38:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is arising that's against these
institutions
which have failed people.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Putin is part of that
movement.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the theory of the
case.

38:07.919 --> 38:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's true, but
they do have
a theory of what is happening.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know if they will be
able to enact
it.

38:13.691 --> 38:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But David's
argument a moment
ago, Mark, is that the
establishment is going

38:17.395 --> 38:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win out because Donald Trump,
he said,
just can't organize a foreign
policy.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know.

38:24.536 --> 38:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, of course -- you know, the
White House,
as Warren Harding said, and I
think accurately,

38:29.073 --> 38:30.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is an alchemist.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We find out the strengths, the
weaknesses
and the smarts and the dumbs of
whoever those

38:34.879 --> 38:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
occupants are under the pressure
of the presidency.

38:37.682 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't see -- I was encouraged
as a citizen
by the selection of General
Mattis, by the

38:44.622 --> 38:52.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nomination of him, by the
command of subject
matter he displayed, and his
independence,

38:52.430 --> 38:53.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
independence of thought.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And so...

38:55.233 --> 38:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we saw that
from several
of the...

38:57.502 --> 38:58.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: We did.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We did.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... choices.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Less convincing
from some others.

39:02.707 --> 39:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pompeo, who had been an
advocate of water-boarding
as a House member, has backed
off and said,

39:07.745 --> 39:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, Donald Trump would never --
if he ever
heard Donald Trump on the stump,
Donald Trump

39:13.284 --> 39:16.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a champion of water-boarding
and more,
as he put it.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, nevertheless, he did
establish that rule
of law.

39:20.825 --> 39:25.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, just
quickly, you did
see a number of these Cabinet
choices, and

39:26.030 --> 39:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're referring to that, put
some distance
between themselves.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it was -- I agree
with Mark.

39:31.236 --> 39:33.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a good week, I think, for
the country
and, frankly, for the Trump
administration.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of us expected a lot of
extremely confrontational
hearings this week.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that really didn't happen.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They sailed through, by and
large.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's because they did
distance themselves.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They behaved like responsible --
even Tillerson,
who was probably the weakest,
because he just

39:47.585 --> 39:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't know that much about
foreign policy.

39:50.655 --> 39:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he apparently in the private
meetings
with the senators has made a
good impression

39:54.392 --> 39:55.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on people.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a professional.

39:56.594 --> 39:58.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's obviously a very
intelligent, polished
man.

39:58.563 --> 40:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the other -- I hate to
praise Trump
so much, but I have always
wanted administrations

40:05.703 --> 40:08.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to admit, yes, we have
differences.

40:08.139 --> 40:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's always been this locked
uniformity,
oh, we all think alike and that,
if we disagree,

40:11.943 --> 40:13.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's somehow a scandal.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, yes, people have
differences.

40:15.546 --> 40:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump didn't emerge
from the orthodoxy
of the Republican Party.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's going to be
bigger differences
than normal.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they can have those
differences out
in the open, I actually think it
would be

40:23.454 --> 40:24.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of a good thing.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're right.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted today, this morning,
early, that
he thought it was a good thing
if they spoke

40:28.526 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for themselves.

40:30.428 --> 40:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But back on Russia, quickly,
Mark, the civil
rights icon Congressman John
Lewis of Georgia

40:35.867 --> 40:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an interview today with Chuck
Todd at NBC
said that Donald Trump is not --
he doesn't

40:40.705 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
view Donald Trump as a
legitimate president,
he said, because the Russians
interfered with

40:46.611 --> 40:47.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. election.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said the results don't
represent legitimacy.

40:51.282 --> 41:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a legitimate
argument,
that Russia's involvement in our
election,

41:00.391 --> 41:03.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's open to question whether,
in fact, it
was influential, determinate.

41:03.961 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that they tried and
were involved
and tried to influence and
subvert our democratic

41:09.467 --> 41:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
processes is indisputable.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
it's not
settled?

41:12.537 --> 41:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't -- no, but
I do think
that there is a certain irony
and perhaps

41:15.907 --> 41:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little payback in the fact
that John Lewis,
a certified icon of the civil
rights movement,

41:21.846 --> 41:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions the legitimacy of the
man who questioned
the legitimacy and led the
fight, falsely,

41:27.185 --> 41:33.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unfairly, and repeatedly
questioned the legitimacy
of Barack Obama as president.

41:33.324 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is perhaps a little sense
of getting
even here.

41:37.795 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:39.364 --> 41:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Whatever happened
to when we
-- they go low, we go high?

41:41.899 --> 41:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I think if you're going to
question the
legitimacy of somebody, you
better have some

41:45.303 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evidence.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And John Lewis is obviously a
hero.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bias that, when we have
an election
result, has to be that the
election results

41:51.976 --> 41:53.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is legitimate.

41:53.511 --> 41:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whatever the Russians did,
it didn't probably
affect the outcome.

41:57.181 --> 42:01.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If we actually have some
evidence to counter
that, then you can say it's a
legitimate -- but

42:01.853 --> 42:06.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bias has always got to be to
respect the
process, to respect the voters
and to assume,

42:06.557 --> 42:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they make a call, that some
deference has
to be paid, unless there is
evidence.

42:09.994 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I understand it, John
Lewis, none of
us know whether the Russian
activity, which

42:14.632 --> 42:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was malevolent, had any huge
significant determining
effect.

42:18.503 --> 42:20.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two more major
things I want
to ask both of you about.

42:20.738 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first one is what Donald
Trump said, Mark,
this week about his business
interests.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he's basically turning
everything
over to his sons, that it will
be a kind of

42:29.280 --> 42:30.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a blind trust.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did he go far enough?

42:31.282 --> 42:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Of course he
didn't, Judy.

42:33.217 --> 42:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said after eight years, he
will grade his
sons, and if they didn't perform
well, they're

42:37.989 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired, sort of an offhand line,
but showing
that he did have a continuing
interest.

42:44.462 --> 42:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's never been a sense of
public service
about this man.

42:49.267 --> 42:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think there is in
this alleged
arrangement.

42:53.704 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's anything but a blind trust.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a seeing-eye trust.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

42:57.141 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a blind trust.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm giving it to my closest
relatives.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's not really
serious.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He said he's not
going to talk
to them about it.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yeah, right.

43:06.918 --> 43:07.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:07.919 --> 43:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He has a different
model.

43:09.921 --> 43:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, most -- the way the laws
are envisioned,
they are for people who work in
the government

43:13.691 --> 43:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or work in a private sector,
and then they
cut it offer and they go to
public service.

43:17.161 --> 43:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's how you're supposed
to do it.

43:19.230 --> 43:22.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he has a pre-modern
monarchic family structure.

43:22.567 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His business is a monarchy with
family members
all around.

43:25.870 --> 43:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His administration is a monarchy
with family
members all around.

43:28.506 --> 43:31.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the laws are just not going
to apply to
him.

43:31.476 --> 43:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will wind up with some
corruption problems,
probably.

43:34.412 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question is
about the
man who Donald Trump is
succeeding as president,

43:38.649 --> 43:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark, and that's President
Obama.

43:40.885 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave a farewell address in
his hometown
of Chicago this week.

43:44.655 --> 43:50.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a call to citizens to
pick up their,
I think, clipboards, he said,
and get involved.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And get out of
their bubbles.

43:52.663 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that was one of the
more -- that,
in fact, we have become bubbles,
whether,

43:57.401 --> 44:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as David has pointed out in the
past, sorting
ourselves into neighborhoods, or
places of

44:01.939 --> 44:05.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worship, or campuses, or
occupations.

44:05.843 --> 44:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the venue just amazed me,
why he would
do a speech of this seriousness
and importance

44:12.750 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a crowd of 18,000.

44:15.119 --> 44:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand it was Chicago and
all the rest
of it.

44:19.023 --> 44:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is a reminder that the
difference today
from eight years ago, the sense
of hope and

44:27.164 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pride in the nation, an
unrealistic hope,
and perhaps unrealistic
self-congratulations

44:33.170 --> 44:35.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his election.

44:35.172 --> 44:42.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he leaves at close to 60
percent approval,
at a time when confidence in
public institutions

44:42.280 --> 44:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is at its lowest, in private
institutions.

44:45.316 --> 44:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he is a major figure going
forward.

44:48.719 --> 44:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's 15 years younger than
the man who
succeeds him, and he promises to
be engaged,

44:53.958 --> 44:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more than going to write his
book or just
go into a paint lesson.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did he leave
you with?

45:01.165 --> 45:03.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think we
saw in the
speech an outstanding man.

45:03.834 --> 45:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he leaves this presidency
with the respect
of almost everybody as a human
being.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he will get very high
marks, as he
mentioned in the speech, for the
handling

45:11.542 --> 45:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the financial crisis, the
auto bailout,
all that stuff.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're in much better shape than
we were.

45:16.147 --> 45:19.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think his foreign policy will
be regarded
more failure than success, in
part because

45:19.917 --> 45:21.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of reasons we heard earlier.

45:21.886 --> 45:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, from a progressive
point of view,
to have a Democratic Congress
and a Democratic

45:25.423 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House, and to have spent
the time on
Obamacare, which had real
benefits, 20 million

45:29.260 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insured, but not on inequality,
was a major
cost to the Democratic Party,
costing them

45:35.199 --> 45:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their majorities, but also a bit
of a cost
to the country, because it
didn't address

45:39.837 --> 45:43.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fundamental issues that led
to Donald
Trump and that led to a lot of
unhappiness,

45:43.140 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just the continued widening
inequality.

45:44.809 --> 45:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And inequality,
you're referring
to?

45:47.144 --> 45:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Income inequality,
social inequality,
all the things that really have
shaped this

45:50.948 --> 45:52.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whole election year.

45:52.850 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is a fact that these
problems, this sense
of fragmentation and
segmentation happened

45:57.121 --> 45:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and were exacerbated, got worse
under President
Obama's...

45:59.657 --> 46:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He has seven more
days in office.

46:01.759 --> 46:06.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we thank both of you, David
Brooks, Mark
Shields.

46:06.597 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

46:12.169 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Finally tonight,
a new movie
navigates tricky terrain,
revisiting recent,

46:20.211 --> 46:21.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and painful, history.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Jeffrey Brown.

46:23.214 --> 46:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a moment
still painfully
fresh for many Americans, April
2013, the

46:29.220 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boston Marathon, with some
30,000 runners
taking to the streets for the
26.2-mile race,

46:35.726 --> 46:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when, suddenly, everything
changed, an explosion
at the finish line on Boylston
Street, 12

46:43.434 --> 46:44.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seconds later, another.

46:44.969 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three people were dead and more
than 260 wounded.

46:49.607 --> 46:53.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so began a panicked search
for the perpetrators
that shut down the city.

46:53.411 --> 46:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Every inch of this city
is getting
searched.

46:57.281 --> 47:02.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That drama
unfolds in the new
film "Patriots Day," starring
Mark Wahlberg

47:02.253 --> 47:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a role stitched together from
multiple
Boston police officers'
experiences.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The film was written and
directed by Peter
Berg.

47:10.394 --> 47:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERG, Director, "Patriots
Day": To me,
the Boston Marathon is a pretty
profound moment

47:16.500 --> 47:18.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in American history.

47:18.369 --> 47:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the lessons that can be
learned from the
way that community came
together, from the

47:21.772 --> 47:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way the police and the FBI
worked together
so effectively to solve that
crime is something,

47:29.547 --> 47:31.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think, worth examining.

47:31.449 --> 47:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Other characters
are based
on real individuals, such as
Boston Police

47:36.854 --> 47:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commissioner Ed Davis, played by
John Goodman,
who wants investigators to
release photos

47:41.959 --> 47:46.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the public of Tamerlan and
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,
the prime suspects.

47:46.263 --> 47:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN BACON, Actor: I understand
Boston, but
I can't just snap my fingers.

47:50.568 --> 47:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This decision goes all the way
up to the attorney
general.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN GOODMAN, Actor: Then give
me his number.

47:53.738 --> 47:54.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'll call him right now.

47:55.072 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is my (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
city, Rick!

47:56.674 --> 47:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Davis retired
later in 2013.

47:58.743 --> 48:02.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED DAVIS, Former Boston Police
Commissioner:
It's been very interesting to
watch the process.

48:02.546 --> 48:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to keep telling
myself, it's not
a documentary, it's a movie.

48:06.684 --> 48:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, you mean at
moments where
you wonder what?

48:09.954 --> 48:11.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ED DAVIS: Sure.

48:11.856 --> 48:16.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can put words in one
person's mouth that
was spoken by someone else, and
you want to

48:16.861 --> 48:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, no, no, it didn't happen
exactly like
that.

48:19.063 --> 48:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you take a step back
and you realize
that it's a story being told for
the public

48:24.368 --> 48:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the complexity of this
investigation
and really about the victims,
about the city,

48:29.473 --> 48:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and about the police officers
that heroically
responded to it, they did a
great job in really

48:36.614 --> 48:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
catching the essence of what
happened.

48:38.549 --> 48:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How concerned
were you, though,
about getting it right, you
know, on weighing

48:42.353 --> 48:48.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the needs of the Hollywood
drama, right, vs.
the news, the actual facts?

48:48.125 --> 48:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERG: I felt that, if we
got it right,
if we just told the truth, we
wouldn't have

48:55.666 --> 49:02.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to worry about Hollywood drama,
or we wouldn't
have to worry about action or
tension or plot

49:02.606 --> 49:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
twists or heroism, or any of the
things that
I guess you look for in a
traditional Hollywood

49:09.380 --> 49:11.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

49:11.315 --> 49:18.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We felt, from the research we
did, that there
was plenty of inspiration and
drama to be

49:18.622 --> 49:20.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
told.

49:20.591 --> 49:23.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Peter Berg,
"Patriots Day"
is the third nonfiction,
ripped-from-the-headlines

49:23.994 --> 49:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project he's worked on with
Wahlberg, following
2013's "Lone Survivor," which
follows a Navy

49:32.503 --> 49:43.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEAL team on a mission in
Afghanistan and
2016's "Deepwater Horizon,"
which recounts

49:43.180 --> 49:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the explosion on the BP drilling
platform
in 2010 that killed 11 men and
spilled nearly

49:49.453 --> 49:54.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
3.2 million barrels of oil into
the Gulf of
Mexico.

49:54.124 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before, those Berg directed the
film "Friday
Night Lights" based on the
nonfiction book

49:59.496 --> 50:04.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nonfiction book by Buzz
Bissinger, and served
as executive producer on the
popular TV drama

50:04.168 --> 50:07.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the same name.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you decide what to
tackle?

50:09.540 --> 50:13.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER BERG: I get attracted to
something for
a variety of reasons.

50:13.777 --> 50:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm obviously attracted to
nonfiction.

50:16.747 --> 50:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm attracted to tales of men
and women doing
their jobs under duress.

50:22.086 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I find that interesting.

50:23.787 --> 50:24.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know why.

50:24.788 --> 50:26.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just do.

50:26.624 --> 50:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I start to hone in on a
story, I
generally see how hard it sticks
and how easy

50:33.998 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is to dismiss.

50:35.566 --> 50:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Patriots Day"
has received
generally positive reviews.

50:39.770 --> 50:46.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But like Berg's other recent
films, its proximity
to actual events raises an old
question.

50:46.510 --> 50:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think it's too soon to be
telling the
story?

50:49.580 --> 50:54.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ED DAVIS: I think that's a
decision that's
made individually by people.

50:54.418 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to a couple that went
to see it,
and the husband, who was at the
finish line,

50:58.322 --> 51:02.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said it was a cathartic
experience for him
and he was very happy that the
film was done.

51:02.293 --> 51:06.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the wife was upset by it and
couldn't
stay for the whole thing.

51:06.830 --> 51:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think it goes person by
person.

51:09.066 --> 51:13.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER BERG: I don't think it's
too early to
examine it.

51:13.304 --> 51:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if we waited much
longer, it would
unfortunately start to be almost
an irrelevant

51:21.145 --> 51:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story, because the news cycle
moves so quickly.

51:23.814 --> 51:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already, since we have filmed
the movie, there
have been at least six major
attacks, and

51:31.522 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's certainly no stop in sight.

51:33.924 --> 51:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are, in a
sense, defining
some history for many people who
might see

51:38.362 --> 51:41.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the story now through your eyes.

51:41.131 --> 51:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, do you feel some personal
responsibility
to get it right, to think about
how it might

51:48.305 --> 51:50.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inflame passions, or help people
think about...

51:50.941 --> 51:51.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETER BERG: Yes.

51:51.942 --> 51:52.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, of course.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

51:54.912 --> 51:58.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, if I feel a
personal responsibility
in terms of presenting a thesis
or something

51:58.282 --> 52:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want an audience to take away,
it's certainly
not that we need to get rid of
every Muslim

52:04.755 --> 52:06.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

52:06.790 --> 52:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's certainly not a commentary
on law enforcement,
although I think we're pretty
clear in our

52:13.497 --> 52:18.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support of law enforcement,
particularly in
the way they handled themselves
during that

52:18.902 --> 52:20.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
period of time.

52:20.637 --> 52:26.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a responsibility for making
sure that
we understand that these acts of
terrorism

52:26.143 --> 52:30.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
don't achieve what the
terrorists think they're
going to achieve.

52:30.647 --> 52:31.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't destroy us.

52:31.648 --> 52:32.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't break us apart.

52:33.083 --> 52:36.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see the very best of human
beings rise
to the surface.

52:36.653 --> 52:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Patriots Day"
opens today
in theaters across the country.

52:40.958 --> 52:46.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown

Donald Trump sees Russia as a
strategic partner
for the U.S., rather than a
global threat.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
