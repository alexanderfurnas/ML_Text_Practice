08:06.353 --> 08:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe has met
with him in person in New York
this evening,

08:11.524 --> 08:16.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
following concern in his country
over statements
candidate Trump made during the
campaign.

08:16.696 --> 08:21.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, questions have been
raised in many
quarters about Trump's foreign
policy, as

08:21.401 --> 08:24.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he decides who his main
appointments in that
arena will be.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We turn now to Michael
Pillsbury, who has
been advising the Trump
transition team.

08:29.042 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has served in past Republican
administrations
in the Defense Department and on
the National

08:34.114 --> 08:36.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Security Council staff.

08:36.216 --> 08:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Rothkopf, he is the
CEO and editor
of "Foreign Policy" magazine and
the author

08:41.988 --> 08:46.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of "National Insecurity:
American Leadership
in An Age of Fear."

08:46.860 --> 08:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Pillsbury, let me start
with you and
ask you about this visit with
the Japanese

08:52.332 --> 08:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prime minister, the meeting late
this afternoon
with Donald Trump.

08:55.735 --> 09:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How typical is it for a foreign
head of government
to meet with someone who's been
elected president,

09:01.274 --> 09:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but hasn't taken office yet?

09:02.842 --> 09:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY, Former U.S.
Assistant Undersecretary
of Defense: It's common.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is basically a Japanese
initiative.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a very good idea.

09:07.714 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It lets the Japanese sort of get
the feel
of Mr. Trump, present some of
their concerns

09:13.086 --> 09:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the campaign rhetoric.

09:15.155 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that Mr. Abe has
already said
that it's an honor for him to be
the first

09:20.994 --> 09:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign leader in some sense
sets up a competitive
dynamic.

09:24.864 --> 09:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been some approaches
already now already
from Prime Minister Modi of
India and other

09:29.068 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries that they would like
to have a chance
to talk to the president-elect
as well.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
it's common,
this is something that is
normally done?

09:35.141 --> 09:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: I don't the
statistics.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The key thing is, the
president-elect can't
act.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can't conduct foreign policy,
but he can
certainly educate himself and
have a chance

09:43.783 --> 09:48.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to meet people, so that, after
he's president,
it won't be the first time, it
won't meeting

09:48.421 --> 09:49.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of two strangers.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Rothkopf,
what about
that?

09:51.925 --> 09:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How accustomed are we, should we
be, to a
president-elect having these
kinds of meetings?

09:56.196 --> 09:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHKOPF, CEO and Editor,
"Foreign Policy":
Well, these kind of things
happen.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama met with foreign
leaders before
he took office.

10:02.402 --> 10:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what president-elect
Trump needs to
think about a little bit is that
his actions

10:07.907 --> 10:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have foreign policy consequences
whether or
not he's meeting with foreign
leaders, so

10:12.345 --> 10:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, for example, if he sends
out a tweet
trying to intimidate or berate
The New York

10:17.784 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Times, foreign leaders who might
be wanting
to do that themselves start
saying, oh, there

10:21.788 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a change in a U.S. policy.

10:23.690 --> 10:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or if he cozies up to Russia, or
if he appoints
an ethno-nationalist as his
primary adviser,

10:29.696 --> 10:34.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people say, oh, perhaps
ethno-nationalism
is in season at the White House.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is being watched.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything he does has a foreign
policy consequence.

10:38.338 --> 10:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me turn
back to you,
Michael Pillsbury, because there
has been

10:42.509 --> 10:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot made about not just
Stephen Bannon being
named as a top counselor to the
president

10:48.214 --> 10:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House, but about
what Donald
Trump said during the campaign.

10:51.417 --> 10:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much concern is there out
there on the
part of foreign leaders about
him?

10:55.388 --> 11:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: Well, it's
hard to be sure
of that, because he's not
president yet.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so things that foreign
leaders say can
be for effect.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can take you back to the
Reagan administration.

11:06.032 --> 11:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was on President Reagan's
transition team.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we had similar issues.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People wanted to get in touch to
know, what
is the true policy going to be/

11:15.008 --> 11:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And transition teams and someone
like me,
especially an adviser on the
outside, don't

11:19.546 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have any authority.

11:21.314 --> 11:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Reagan didn't really
get to his
main national security strategy
until after

11:25.818 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one year in office.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of these key documents,
national security
decision, Directive 32 on the
Soviet Union,

11:31.958 --> 11:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
took one year to hash out.

11:33.826 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're really in a very early
phase, where,
as David says, yes, the tweets
are read and

11:40.867 --> 11:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are watching, but these
are not official
acts.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no team of secretary of
state and
defense actually meeting to
hammer things

11:47.206 --> 11:48.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out yet.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're way early to see what the
Trump administration
role in history is going to be.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David
Rothkopf, it sounds
like Michael Pillsbury is saying
it's just

11:55.715 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too early to get concerned about
any of this
until he takes office and starts
making decisions.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ROTHKOPF: Well, I don't
know if it's
too early.

12:02.422 --> 12:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, you had the head of
the National
Security Agency saying that
Russia had taken

12:07.594 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an active role in trying to tip
the scales
of this election towards Trump.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, indeed, that's what
happened.

12:13.967 --> 12:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then Trump got on the phone with
Russia, talked
to Putin, waxed rhapsodic about
a letter from

12:19.772 --> 12:20.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

12:21.007 --> 12:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A day later, Putin launches a
major offensive
in Syria.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the people who Trump is
considering
are people who are fairly cozy
with the Russians,

12:30.950 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including General Mike Flynn.

12:32.986 --> 12:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so all of a sudden people
are starting
to put pieces together.

12:37.090 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael's right it takes time
for a foreign
policy legacy to emerge, but,
for -- first

12:42.996 --> 12:44.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
impressions matter.

12:44.664 --> 12:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, Donald Trump is
making some
pretty disturbing first
impressions.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
come back on
the specifics of that.

12:51.337 --> 12:52.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, Michael, go ahead.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: I don't agree
at all on...

12:53.339 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

12:55.174 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: Well, a new
president from
whatever party deserves a bit of
a cease-fire

12:59.479 --> 13:00.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in my view.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The election is over.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Politics is going to continue.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be harsh criticism of
Donald Trump,
I'm sure, for the next four
years.

13:06.419 --> 13:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my favorite expressions
in Washington
is something George Shultz once
said, I think

13:11.557 --> 13:13.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the "PBS NewsHour."

13:13.826 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "Nothing
ever gets settled
in this town."

13:17.397 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, conflicts continue.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can criticize Mike Flynn, but
he's not
been named yet as the national
security adviser.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I personally hope he is.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ready General Mike Flynn's
book on the war
on terror.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's quite good.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about...

13:30.209 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: He's not
speaking right
now.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Flynn, going on TV, for
example, he
doesn't speak as a government
official.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was an election campaign
which is now
over, and there needs to be a
kind of break

13:39.986 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this harsh daily criticism of
Mr. Trump
and his team.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David
Rothkopf, I hear
you saying that there are
signals being sent

13:46.759 --> 13:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the conversation that Donald
Trump had
with Vladimir Putin, for
example.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHKOPF: Of course.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are signals that are
being sent
with tweets intimidating The
Times, and there

13:56.969 --> 14:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are signals being sent with who
he's evaluating
for key offices and who might be
the people

14:02.709 --> 14:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he chooses to appoint to
those offices.

14:06.145 --> 14:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, yes, it would be
nice, ideally,
if we could set aside the
politics for a moment,

14:11.718 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but some of these things are not
political.

14:13.619 --> 14:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you go and take somebody
who's run a
publication that's a white
supremacist, misogynist

14:20.626 --> 14:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
publication and appoint him
right next door
to the president in the White
House, that

14:24.997 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sends a message, particularly in
Europe right
now, where there's a rising tide
of the right.

14:30.103 --> 14:34.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those people who he's
appointed, Steve
Bannon, has already sent a
message to the

14:34.974 --> 14:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Le Pen team who is going to
contend for the
presidency of France next year,
extreme right-wingers.

14:42.381 --> 14:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he's saying, look, we
will help you,
we're part of this rising tide
of the right.

14:47.353 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, actions are being taken,
choices are being
made, and the consequences are
serious.

14:51.924 --> 14:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should say
that the
Breitbart News organization
argues against

14:57.196 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the characterization that it's
white supremacist.

15:00.032 --> 15:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, setting that aside, Michael
Pillsbury,
what about this argument that,
already, by

15:06.506 --> 15:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his statements, even saying I
had a good conversation
with Vladimir Putin, and the
next day Russia

15:13.179 --> 15:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
launches yet another strike,
punishing strike
in Syria, that those are not
things that we

15:18.885 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be concerned about, at
the very least?

15:21.354 --> 15:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: I think the
key thing is
a White House fact sheet that
President Obama

15:25.825 --> 15:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued and President Obama's own
statements
that the Obama administration
has tried very

15:32.265 --> 15:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard to prepare memos for every
government
department for the last few
months suggesting

15:38.471 --> 15:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what to do, descriptions of what
has happened
so far.

15:41.607 --> 15:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those will not be turned
over until Mr.
Trump's transition teams arrive
in the buildings.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the problem we have right
now is that
the transition teams have not
been sent.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they did
arrive today.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of them did arrive today.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL PILLSBURY: And this is a
setback for
the past week or so, but it's
easy to remedy

15:58.057 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now the dialogue begins.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, things like David is
concerned about,
they will begin to sort of get
hold of what's

16:05.064 --> 16:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been going on in various foreign
policy and
defense areas quite soon.

16:09.702 --> 16:14.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're in this very, very
premature first week
now, as I appeal again to David,
give people

16:14.874 --> 16:16.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a break.

16:16.843 --> 16:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are just
beginning to watch,
and this is the first of many,
many conversations

16:21.147 --> 16:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we are going to be having on
this.

16:22.315 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Michael Pillsbury, David
Rothkopf, we thank
you both.

16:33.926 --> 16:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHKOPF: Pleasure.

16:40.299 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than 200
nations reaffirmed
their commitment to the Paris
climate accord

16:48.541 --> 16:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today during a U.N. summit in
Morocco.

16:51.210 --> 16:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The show of support comes amidst
worries that
U.S. president-elect Donald
Trump will pull

16:55.848 --> 16:57.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of the deal.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also comes as dozens of
wildfires continue
to burn across the Southeast
region of this

17:02.989 --> 17:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, more than 30 that are
still uncontained
in North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia,

17:09.395 --> 17:11.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tennessee, Alabama, and
Kentucky.

17:11.697 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And climate change could be one
factor that
may contribute to the drought
conditions feeding

17:16.335 --> 17:18.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham has a closer
look at how
a Trump administration might
change America's

17:21.540 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
course on climate change.

17:23.342 --> 17:28.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We're going
to cancel the Paris climate
agreement.

17:28.514 --> 17:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department of Environmental
Protection, we're
going to get rid of it in almost
every form.

17:33.653 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Throughout the
long campaign,
Donald Trump made clear he wants
a sharp turnabout

17:38.257 --> 17:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in U.S. environmental policy.

17:39.625 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, coal country,
what they
have done.

17:43.195 --> 17:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He repeatedly
pledged to
undo the Obama administration's
Clean Power

17:48.668 --> 17:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plan, an aggressive effort to
cut carbon emissions
from power plants.

17:52.171 --> 17:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Energy is under
siege by the
Obama administration, under
absolute siege.

17:57.610 --> 18:02.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The EPA, Environmental
Protection Agency,
is killing these energy
companies.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since winning
the election,
the president-elect has tapped
climate change

18:06.485 --> 18:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skeptic Myron Ebell to head the
EPA transition.

18:10.990 --> 18:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has repeatedly expressed
his own skepticism
about climate change, like in
this 2012 tweet,

18:16.362 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he said: "The concept of
global warming
was created by and for the
Chinese in order

18:21.534 --> 18:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make U.S. manufacturing
noncompetitive."

18:24.337 --> 18:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years later, he wrote:
"Global warming
is an expensive hoax."

18:28.541 --> 18:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Paris climate
accords officially
took effect on November 4.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're an agreement among
dozens of nations
all aimed at limiting worldwide
warming to

18:39.618 --> 18:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just an additional 2 degrees
Celsius.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a little over 3.5 degrees
Fahrenheit.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But doubts about what
president-elect Trump
will do are hanging over this
week's U.N.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate conference in Morocco.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We will not be silenced.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States will shred the
document.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It would take
four years
to withdraw from the Paris
accords, but there

18:58.804 --> 19:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are no enforcement mechanisms,
so the new
Trump administration could
simply ignore the

19:03.342 --> 19:05.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S.' commitments.

19:05.077 --> 19:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Morocco yesterday, Secretary
of State John
Kerry warned against taking that
step.

19:09.749 --> 19:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said climate change shouldn't
be a partisan
issue.

19:13.085 --> 19:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: No one
has a right to make decisions
that affect

19:17.089 --> 19:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
billions of people based on
solely ideology.

19:20.459 --> 19:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At the same
time, 365 American
companies have written to the
president-elect

19:26.665 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imploring him to uphold the
Paris accords
and warning -- quote -- "Failure
to build

19:31.904 --> 19:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a low-carbon economy puts
American prosperity
at risk."

19:35.408 --> 19:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what would environmental
policy actually
look like under a Trump
administration?

19:41.647 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Roberts covers this for
Vox.

19:43.349 --> 19:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a writer and journalist
who has long
reported on the need for
tackling climate

19:47.086 --> 19:48.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins me now from Portland.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Roberts, let's start off
talking about
the man who's going to help the
Trump administration

19:53.926 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shape energy policy.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who is Myron Ebell and what does
he believe?

19:58.364 --> 20:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS, Vox: Myron Ebell
is the director
of the Climate Change Program at
the Competitive

20:03.836 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Enterprise Institute, which is a
think tank
in Washington, D.C.

20:08.207 --> 20:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His belief is that climate
change is a hoax
or possibly no big deal,
happening and no

20:15.514 --> 20:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big deal, or possibly happening
and good for
us, depending on which day you
ask him, so

20:22.588 --> 20:25.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain we don't need any public
policy to
help counter it.

20:25.591 --> 20:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, in some
ways, he seems
like an ideological fit as far
as what we

20:31.130 --> 20:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understand Donald Trump's
policies to believe
and positions?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: That's right.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a very clear signal
from the
Trump camp that he wasn't
kidding in what

20:41.006 --> 20:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he said about climate change on
the trail.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit
about some of the things the
Trump administration

20:45.878 --> 20:47.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might do.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With regards to the Paris
accords -- this
is, for those who are following
along, a whole

20:51.016 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of nations have binded
together to say,
we're going to pledge to cut
emissions going

20:56.489 --> 20:58.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

20:58.290 --> 21:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Trump administration
wanted to, can
they just walk back from those
commitments?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can they just walk away from the
accords themselves?

21:05.865 --> 21:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: Absolutely.

21:08.300 --> 21:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole premise of the Paris
agreement is
that all the commitments from
all the countries

21:12.304 --> 21:14.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involved are voluntary.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was one of the reasons that
it was a
breakthrough is that making
those commitments

21:18.077 --> 21:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voluntary sort of opened people,
opened countries
up and made them a little bit
more ambitious.

21:22.681 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the consequence of them
being voluntary
is that Trump can absolutely
walk away.

21:27.620 --> 21:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will take him several years
to formally
get the U.S. out of the accord,
but nothing

21:34.160 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is stopping him from just
stating that he's
not going to pursue the targets
and not going

21:38.697 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do anything to attempt to
meet our commitments
there.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is no legal mechanism
that can stop
him.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Same question
with regards
to domestic policy.

21:48.507 --> 21:52.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is a Trump administration
energy policy,
what is that going to look like?

21:52.311 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: Well, I think the
first priority
is going to be to dismantle the
Obama environmental

22:00.986 --> 22:02.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
legacy.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That will be the priority.

22:03.956 --> 22:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, the Clean
Power Plan, which
is aimed at power plants, will
be either rolled

22:11.330 --> 22:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back or delayed or slow-walked
or reversed
entirely, depending on what road
they take.

22:19.004 --> 22:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the initial efforts
are all going
to be designed to dismantle
everything that

22:24.510 --> 22:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama has done in this area over
the last
eight years.

22:27.112 --> 22:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's hard to
know if voters
picked Trump because of his
energy policy,

22:32.051 --> 22:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I think it's undeniable that
there are
a lot of people in the country,
especially

22:35.354 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in states like West Virginia,
who think that,when
you talk about cutting carbon
emissions, you

22:40.292 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean that you're cutting their
jobs, that
energy costs are going to go up.

22:44.830 --> 22:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to a lot of voters, that
just doesn't
seem like an exchange they want
to make.

22:49.735 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that -- in some ways,
Trump has something
of mandate, doesn't he?

22:54.540 --> 22:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: I don't think so,
William.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A couple of things.

22:58.944 --> 23:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, not a lot of people know
this yet,
but renewable energy now employs
far more

23:03.515 --> 23:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the United States than
coal does,
certainly.

23:06.318 --> 23:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's more jobs in the solar
industry alone
than there is in coal anymore.

23:10.856 --> 23:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in terms of job growth,
renewables are
a much more fertile source of
that than fossil

23:17.096 --> 23:19.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fuels.

23:19.098 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, if you actually go
beneath the general
level and poll the public on
individual questions

23:24.870 --> 23:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like should we do something to
restrain carbon
emissions, should we tighten
regulations on

23:30.843 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pollution, should we support
renewable energy,
support for those policies is
incredibly high

23:36.482 --> 23:40.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
across the board, across
demographics, across
regions of the country.

23:41.020 --> 23:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're looking at individual
environmental
policies, public support is
enormous.

23:45.658 --> 23:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is that there just
aren't that
many members of the public who
make those

23:49.495 --> 23:51.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues their priority.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't think that Trump's
win necessarily
tells us anything about what the
public thinks

23:55.834 --> 24:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about energy policy, so much as
it tells us
that the public just doesn't
think about energy

24:00.139 --> 24:01.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy very much.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With regards
to those coal
jobs, Trump made a repeated
pledge that he's

24:05.110 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to bring the coal industry
back.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that in the president's power
to do?

24:09.014 --> 24:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: Absolutely not.

24:10.949 --> 24:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the main thing that is
killing coal
right now in the U.S. is cheap
natural gas,

24:17.089 --> 24:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's market competition.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's market competition that's
killing coal,
and that's going to be true no
matter what

24:23.762 --> 24:25.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump does.

24:25.631 --> 24:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's automation in the
coal industry,
so coal mining jobs have been
declining for

24:29.535 --> 24:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 years now from their historic
highs and
will continue to decline as
automation increases.

24:37.142 --> 24:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, most of the forces that are
adverse to
coal in the U.S., particularly
adverse to

24:44.416 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coal mining jobs, are outside
the president's
control and are definitely going
to continue

24:49.955 --> 24:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no matter what Trump does.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing is whether
those people
that he made those promises to
remember those

24:55.828 --> 24:57.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
promises and hold him
accountable.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say
Trump does everything
that he promised to do, he
treats climate

25:00.966 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change like a hoax, he walks
away from the
Paris accords, he dismantles the
EPA's regulations.

25:07.039 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does the U.S.' position
mean for the
global effort to cut carbon
emissions?

25:11.944 --> 25:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much of this will impact
what the rest
of the planet is doing already?

25:15.981 --> 25:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: That is indeed
the $6 million
question, and no one quite knows
the answer

25:21.887 --> 25:22.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The news is not good.

25:24.590 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the Paris agreement and
a lot of
international cooperation on
climate change

25:28.827 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has been built on U.S.
leadership recently.

25:32.297 --> 25:37.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's leadership helped bring
China into
the fold, to the table to do
this.

25:37.836 --> 25:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the prospect of the
U.S. and China
acting in concert helped bring
the rest of

25:42.641 --> 25:44.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world to the table.

25:44.743 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in a large sense, this
edifice is built
on top of U.S. leadership.

25:49.515 --> 25:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you yank U.S. leadership
out from underneath
it, at the very least, I think
it's going

25:56.188 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be much more shaky and
vulnerable.

25:59.691 --> 26:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it continues on as it
has been depends
on a lot of economic forces and
technological

26:06.632 --> 26:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innovation and a lot of things
that we can't
really predict.

26:09.268 --> 26:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, at the very least,
action is
much more fragile and contingent
than it was

26:15.908 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before this news.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
David Roberts
of Vox, thank you very much.

26:20.913 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID ROBERTS: Thank you,
William.

26:28.921 --> 26:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The so-called
EB-5 visa permits
foreign nationals to invest in
job-creating

26:37.062 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
programs in the U.S. in exchange
for permanent
residency.

26:40.532 --> 26:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's been scandal-plagued,
leading to
calls for reform.

26:44.703 --> 26:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Congress gets set to tackle
some final
business before the end of this
year, will

26:49.374 --> 26:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the program finally get fixed?

26:51.910 --> 26:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economics Paul Solman takes
a look.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

26:57.382 --> 27:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL, Dubai: See, in
Dubai the thing
is, as long as you work in
Dubai, you can

27:03.021 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
live in Dubai.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what if you leave the job?

27:06.925 --> 27:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to go back to Pakistan,
which we don't
want to.

27:09.828 --> 27:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Noreen and Shehryar
Iqbal thought
they had a surefire way to avoid
a return

27:13.999 --> 27:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to their native Pakistan.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: It's not a safe
country.

27:16.602 --> 27:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL, Dubai: It's got
a lot of security
challenges.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: He's a flight
attendant for Dubai's
national airline.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was, too, until they had
kids.

27:25.477 --> 27:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their plan, sock away enough of
their salaries
to buy their way into America
via the EB-5

27:33.118 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visa program, which grants green
cards, and
eventually U.S. citizenship, to
foreigners

27:38.223 --> 27:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and their immediate families.

27:40.526 --> 27:46.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just invest half-a-million
dollars to create
at least 10 full-time jobs in
either a rural

27:46.698 --> 27:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
project or an urban area with a
high unemployment
rate.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: We saved even the
allowance
money.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can say that.

27:54.373 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's so embarrassing for us to
tell somebody
that allowance money is for you
to eat, but

27:59.144 --> 28:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we used to save that also.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, you mean the
money that the
airline would give you.

28:03.582 --> 28:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: The airline give
you on your
flight to have your food and
everything, we

28:07.386 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would save that also.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And put it away.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: Put it away.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To that, they added
Shehryar's
small inheritance -- his parents
had died

28:14.293 --> 28:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a car crash when he was a
teenager -- and
investments they'd made to grow
their nest

28:19.164 --> 28:20.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
egg.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL: She bought a
little studio
in a nice upscale area.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called the Jumeirah Lake
Towers.

28:23.902 --> 28:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was generating a very, very
good rental
income.

28:27.472 --> 28:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Are you -- you're
starting to
remember it all?

28:32.644 --> 28:33.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what's going on?

28:33.645 --> 28:34.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NOREEN IQBAL: Sorry.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, no, it's OK.

28:37.015 --> 28:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: So, we rarely talk
about this,
because I start to...

28:41.219 --> 28:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A lot of tears have
been shed
over the EB-5 project the Iqbals
chose to

28:46.291 --> 28:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
invest in, one we first covered
last year
here on Making Sense.

28:50.896 --> 28:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Jay Peak ski resort in
Northern Vermont,
coupled with plans for a hugely
ambitious

28:56.969 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stem cell manufacturing facility
affiliated
with a South Korean biotech
firm.

29:02.641 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in April, the Securities
and Exchange
Commission charged developers
Ariel Quiros

29:07.613 --> 29:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bill Stenger with 52 counts
of federal
securities violations, alleging
they'd misused

29:14.319 --> 29:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$200 million of EB-5 investor
funds, running
the ski resort project as a
giant Ponzi scheme,

29:23.195 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the stem cell project as a
total fraud.

29:26.698 --> 29:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iqbals, who put down their
money on stem
cells, have lost not just their
half-million

29:31.403 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollar investment, but another
$65,000 in
legal and administrative fees,
with not a

29:37.275 --> 29:39.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
green card in sight.

29:39.645 --> 29:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked to them on their
recent visit to
the U.S. on tourist visas using
their free

29:44.683 --> 29:46.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flight passes.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you now wiped out?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL: Yes.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOREEN IQBAL: All of the money,
it was just
squandered, you know?

29:51.990 --> 29:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you lost your
entire inheritance.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL: Yes.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it hurts me, because my mom
and dad were
very young when they passed
away.

29:59.064 --> 30:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was my job to protect the
money that
they have left us.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that -- it really breaks my
heart.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Does it make you
think differently
about America?

30:08.940 --> 30:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL: To be honest,
unfortunately,
yes.

30:11.343 --> 30:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have lived in countries which
are not regulated,
but we have never been cheated
on this scale.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have never been cheated at
all, to be honest.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Iqbals feel
that America
is really letting them down.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON, EB-5 Investment
Adviser: The
United States is.

30:23.121 --> 30:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That the government, through its
agencies,
are not monitoring this activity
is really

30:28.927 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disgraceful.

30:30.796 --> 30:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Michael Gibson is
an independent
EB-5 investment adviser who says
he thoroughly

30:35.033 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vets projects before
recommending them to
clients, documenting everything
on tape.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you go around the country.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: All over the
United States.

30:42.974 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Recording EB-5
projects.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: Absolutely.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Been doing it since 2008.

30:49.081 --> 30:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But only one in 10
projects,
he says, agree to let him in.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: The biggest
problem is transparency.

30:55.721 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency that's administering
the program
offers no disclosure regarding
any of the

31:01.593 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investments.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're an investor and
you're asking
questions about how many
projects they have

31:07.032 --> 31:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developed, how much capital they
have raised,
what they have done with that
capital, how

31:10.235 --> 31:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many jobs have been created,
none of this
information is disclosed.

31:13.672 --> 31:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's not just
700 investors
in the Vermont project who've
literally paid

31:18.710 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the price.

31:20.545 --> 31:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In South Dakota, an EB-5-funded
beef packing
plant went belly up, taking the
funds of some

31:26.785 --> 31:28.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
300 investors with it.

31:28.587 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: They assumed
that the state
was overseeing this investment,
and the fact

31:33.158 --> 31:34.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is that they were not.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
There is no set
of sanctions for violations, no
recourse for

31:39.865 --> 31:41.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bad actors.

31:41.933 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Last year, six
bills were introduced
in Congress to reform the EB-5
program, increasing

31:46.872 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scrutiny of the so-called
regional centers,
private firms that sponsor EB-5
developments.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
None passed.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

31:57.215 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: There are a few
regional centers
with very powerful connections
in Washington,

32:02.554 --> 32:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including their lobbyists.

32:04.322 --> 32:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are concerned any reform
would impact
their ability to raise capital
for cities

32:08.226 --> 32:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such as New York and Los Angeles
and Miami.

32:10.729 --> 32:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right, says
Angelique Brunner,
who owns and operates five
regional centers.

32:15.167 --> 32:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, without EB-5, she says,
many urban projects,
like this retail development in
Washington,

32:21.373 --> 32:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.C., would never break ground.

32:22.974 --> 32:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELIQUE BRUNNER, EB5 Capital:
We're an essential
piece of projects like this.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We work directly with
developers.

32:28.213 --> 32:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen firsthand the
challenges
that they experience in the
capital markets

32:32.818 --> 32:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when they're going to raise
capital.

32:34.719 --> 32:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's an important part of
the story to
encourage other capital players
to come to

32:41.026 --> 32:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the table in terms of banking
and other equity.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: "Oh, really?" says
Gibson.

32:45.330 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then what about all the
EB-5-funded projects
rising in Manhattan, amid
similar conventionally

32:51.403 --> 32:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financed projects, luxury condos
in Tribeca,
ritzy Midtown hotels and office
buildings?

32:58.476 --> 33:03.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's the largest
EB-5 project
of them all, Hudson Yards on the
far West

33:03.982 --> 33:05.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Side.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It had no shortage of Americans
willing to
invest, says Gibson.

33:08.186 --> 33:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: And many would
argue that,
in fact, they already had
capital lined up.

33:12.891 --> 33:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just were pursuing EB-5
capital, as it
was lower-cost.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was cheaper financing for
them.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's it?

33:19.397 --> 33:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: That's it.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, it's not
creating jobs then
at all.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: They would have
created the
jobs anyway.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what many would argue.

33:26.705 --> 33:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is simply a way for them to
save a point
or two on their financing.

33:30.508 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Scandals, fishy
financing, yet
lobbyists have kept Congress
from cleaning

33:36.047 --> 33:38.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things up, for the usual
reasons, says Gibson.

33:38.917 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: The developers
are very well-financed,
well-heeled.

33:41.586 --> 33:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They donate to the political
campaigns of
many of these politicians.

33:45.624 --> 33:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if the developers can save
several million
dollars, they are going to
encourage their

33:51.930 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians to have them --
allow them to
use the EB-5 capital for their
development.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's self-interest.

34:02.073 --> 34:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the case of Jay
Peak, which
was part of a state-run regional
center, the

34:06.177 --> 34:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lobbying was done by Alex
MacLean, a former
assistant to Vermont's governor.

34:11.082 --> 34:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX MACLEAN, Former Assistant
to Vermont
Governor: One of the amazing
things about

34:13.084 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vermont is that it's so small,
and the access
to the politicians is readily
available.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Nobody
knows the system better than me.

34:21.359 --> 34:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, no American
political story
would be complete these days
without Donald

34:25.697 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, indeed, he figures in this
one.

34:28.867 --> 34:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just this month, Trump Bay
Street, a 50-story
luxury apartment building,
opened in Jersey

34:35.206 --> 34:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City, New Jersey, built by a
company run by
Trump's son-in-law, Jared
Kushner, who raised

34:41.079 --> 34:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a quarter of the project's $200
million financing
from EB-5 investors in China.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Which is why I
alone can fix
it.

34:51.890 --> 34:57.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, locally and
federally, the
door between government and
lobbying keeps

34:57.095 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
revolving.

34:58.830 --> 35:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to Michael Gibson, the
stakes of closing
it for EB-5 projects are
substantial.

35:03.234 --> 35:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GIBSON: The issue is
that it is affecting
the credibility of the United
States, because

35:08.974 --> 35:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
granting what is probably the
most cherished
document in the world, a U.S.
passport, and

35:15.647 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path to eventual citizenship is
really in
the hands of developers, who at
times do scheme

35:22.787 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and fraud to take advantage of
the investors.

35:25.523 --> 35:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Iqbals, their
dreams of immigration
to the U.S. dashed, still make
their home

35:30.962 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Dubai, at least for now.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For them, American credibility
is shot.

35:36.534 --> 35:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEHRYAR IQBAL: If someone would
come and
ask me, "I have got
half-a-million dollars

35:40.505 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I want to move to the U.S.,"
I would probably
say, don't do it.

35:46.044 --> 35:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent
Paul Solman reporting for the
"PBS NewsHour."

35:55.520 --> 36:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the week or
so since
the election, there has been
mounting criticism

36:04.729 --> 36:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of whether Web giants like
Facebook and Google
used enough discretion and
editorial responsibility

36:11.169 --> 36:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in screening out fake news
sites.

36:13.638 --> 36:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new analysis by BuzzFeed found
that false
election stories from hoax sites
and hyperpartisan

36:19.411 --> 36:24.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blogs generated more engagement
than content
from real news sites during the
last three

36:24.516 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months of the election.

36:26.451 --> 36:31.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Users shared false stories like
this one about
Pope Francis endorsing Donald
Trump, or Hillary

36:31.723 --> 36:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton selling weapons to ISIS
hundreds of
thousands of times, even more
than real stories.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama weighed in today
during his
trip to Germany.

36:40.865 --> 36:52.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
If we are not serious about
facts and what's

36:52.177 --> 36:58.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
true and what's not, and
particularly in an
age of social media, where so
many people

36:58.683 --> 37:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are getting their information in
sound bites
and snippets off their phones,
if we can't

37:07.058 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discriminate between serious
arguments and
propaganda, then we have
problems.

37:14.966 --> 37:19.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Craig
Silverman worked on
the analysis done by BuzzFeed,
and he joins

37:19.904 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

37:21.139 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Craig, how do we know Facebook's
impact on
the electorate?

37:24.442 --> 37:26.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you research this?

37:26.244 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN, BuzzFeed: Well,
what we did
is looked for the biggest 20
hits in the last

37:30.982 --> 37:35.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three months before the election
from sites
that published fake news or
sites that had

37:35.720 --> 37:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
published something false that
also went viral,
and then we looked at the total
number of

37:39.491 --> 37:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Facebook engagements for those.

37:41.059 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's a number that
encompasses, the
comments, reactions and the
shares.

37:44.762 --> 37:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we decided to compare those
to the top
20 real election news hits from
19 major news

37:50.635 --> 37:52.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organizations.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we ended up seeing,
which was quite
surprising, was, in those last
three months

37:55.306 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election, compared to the
six months
before that, the engagement on
the top 20

37:59.911 --> 38:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fake stories was actually higher
than what
you saw for the real news.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you found
that some
of these sites were really news
sites, but

38:05.583 --> 38:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still they had as much power, if
not more,
than, say, The New York Times or
The Washington

38:09.354 --> 38:10.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Post?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: That was one of
the really
surprising things to me.

38:12.557 --> 38:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't expect fake news to get
more engagement
than real news overall, but to
see that the

38:16.861 --> 38:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading fake news site getting
the most engagement
had only been registered months
before, and

38:22.834 --> 38:27.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its top four fake stories got
more Facebook
engagement than the top four
election stories

38:27.672 --> 38:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from The Washington Post, I
mean, that was
really surprising.

38:29.741 --> 38:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you found
in some of
your investigations that some of
these are

38:33.178 --> 38:38.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sites that were built in
Macedonia for more
of a profit motive than a
political one.

38:38.082 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: Yes.

38:39.851 --> 38:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few weeks ago, we published a
story where
we had found well over 100 sites
focused on

38:44.389 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. politics being run out of
one small town
in the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia.

38:49.561 --> 38:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we looked at the
content that they
were publishing, they were
consistently pro-Trump.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also saw that they were
consistently
publishing things that weren't
true.

38:57.202 --> 39:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, some of their biggest
hits before
Election Day were things that
weren't true.

39:01.172 --> 39:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we did this calculation
of the top
20 fake election hits, we did
find two Macedonian

39:07.045 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sites there.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark
Zuckerberg said it's
kind of a crazy idea to think
that fake news

39:12.317 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really tilted the election; 99.9
percent of
the stuff we publish is solid
and, in fact,

39:17.589 --> 39:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have had a positive effect.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We actually got a lot of people
to register
to vote.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That probably is a much more
measurable impact
on the election.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: I agree that
that is more
measurable.

39:26.598 --> 39:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the problems that we have
right now
is that Facebook doesn't make a
lot of data

39:30.868 --> 39:32.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
available publicly.

39:32.704 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the analysis that we did is
just one slice
of a lot of different
investigations that

39:38.142 --> 39:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think people should be able to
do.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know the impact of fake
news on the
election.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's correct to
say that it
swayed things in favor of Trump.

39:46.384 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think it was a deciding
factor, but
it definitely had some kind of a
factor.

39:50.255 --> 39:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that fake news was
going more viral
towards Election Day than
mainstream news

39:55.326 --> 39:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporting is really surprising
and I think
something that we should be
concerned about.

39:58.696 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fake news has
been around
as long as the Internet.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the difference now?

40:04.669 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: I would argue,
actually,
fake news predates the Internet
as well.

40:07.805 --> 40:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think about the early
newspapers, they
were often partisan newspapers
and they would

40:12.143 --> 40:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
publish things that were fake.

40:13.978 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Internet came along, and
obviously anybody
can become a publisher.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It becomes more democratized.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, yes, you will have more
fake news.

40:20.685 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a really deciding factor is
Facebook,
where there are more than 1.7
billion people

40:24.689 --> 40:28.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world logging in
every month, where
stuff can really get a
tremendous velocity

40:28.860 --> 40:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very quickly and reach a huge
amount of people.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a really game-changing
factor.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't seen fake news and
hoaxes get as
much exposure as they do now,
just because

40:37.001 --> 40:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of how big a platform Facebook
is.

40:39.337 --> 40:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
diminishing value
of what the source is for facts
today?

40:45.376 --> 40:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because it seems, when I ask
someone, where
did you hear that, they say, oh,
I saw it

40:49.013 --> 40:50.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on my phone.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I press one further, they
say, oh,
it was on Facebook.

40:52.350 --> 40:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they often don't say, well,
it was from
BuzzFeed, and Craig Silverman
wrote it.

40:56.054 --> 41:00.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: I think there
is a different
pattern of information
consumption now.

41:00.258 --> 41:04.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People sometimes talk about the
promiscuity
of consumers now, where, sure,
you might see

41:04.996 --> 41:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that a friend has
shared on Facebook.

41:06.931 --> 41:09.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You might see something as a
link on Twitter.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Somebody might e-mail something
to you.

41:11.836 --> 41:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while you may go to your
chosen sources
in the morning or at night,
you're also getting

41:15.873 --> 41:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stuff from other sources.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, for certain
people, they don't
necessarily take a step back and
say, OK,

41:21.446 --> 41:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where did this come from, what
is this Web
site?

41:23.314 --> 41:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just sort of consume things
in an almost
passive way, and fake stuff can
slip into

41:27.585 --> 41:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that real stream of news a lot
easier.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does this
create an echo
chamber?

41:32.156 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal had a
red feed/blue
feed experiment, where who had
friends that

41:37.128 --> 41:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were perhaps on one side of the
aisle saw
news that was very similar and
self-affirming.

41:41.232 --> 41:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: There is
definitely an echo
chamber effect.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some people call it a filter
bubble.

41:47.972 --> 41:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, humans do like
to consume
information that aligns with
their existing

41:52.110 --> 41:53.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beliefs.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we read something that
goes along
with what we already think or
that we think

41:55.680 --> 41:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be true, we are inclined
to believe
it.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We might also be inclined to
share it.

42:00.218 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happens is, on a place
like Facebook,
where there are algorithms that
are deciding

42:04.756 --> 42:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what things to show us in news
feeds, the
more that we consume a certain
type of information,

42:08.760 --> 42:12.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the more the algorithms learn
that we like
that, and will serve us more of
that.

42:12.063 --> 42:13.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: And so it's
very easy for
us to end up only consuming
information from

42:15.633 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one point of view, only
consuming information
from a certain slice of sources.

42:19.704 --> 42:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I worry about sort of the
collapse of
that middle ground for not only
political

42:24.409 --> 42:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation, but for other
things as well.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
what's Facebook,
what's Google doing about this?

42:28.479 --> 42:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: Right now, the
main thing
that's happened is, Google --
and then Facebook

42:32.717 --> 42:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed suit -- have both
announced that
they will not allow fake news
sites, sites

42:36.454 --> 42:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are publishing false
information, to
participate in their advertising
programs.

42:40.525 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Google announcement is
probably a
little more significant, because
its advertising

42:44.529 --> 42:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program was used by a lot of
sites to earn
money.

42:48.433 --> 42:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, right now, what we have
is a little
bit of shutting off of the
financial motive

42:52.170 --> 42:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this, which I think is
actually a pretty
powerful thing.

42:54.672 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Craig Silverman
from BuzzFeed joining us
tonight, thank you.

43:01.446 --> 43:05.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CRAIG SILVERMAN: Thanks.

43:05.883 --> 43:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we go from
fake news on
social streams to the TV screen,
humor, politics,

43:14.826 --> 43:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the life of a perpetual
outsider.

43:18.229 --> 43:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talks with the
host of the late-night
"Daily Show," Trevor Noah, whose
new memoir

43:23.167 --> 43:26.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has just been published.

43:26.304 --> 43:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was the
morning after the
morning after, and, along with
the rest of

43:34.545 --> 43:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, the producers and writers of
"The Daily
Show" were grappling with the
recent earthquake

43:40.651 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in American politics.

43:42.086 --> 43:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were serious exchanges
about the role
of protest.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH, Host, "The Daily
Show": If it
were Trump people who were in
the streets

43:47.992 --> 43:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing the same thing, burning
effigies of
Hillary Clinton, it's like, come
on, guys,

43:52.630 --> 43:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really, in America, in
democracy?

43:56.133 --> 43:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There were jokes
and laughter.

43:57.435 --> 44:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: One guy had this huge sign
that was like,
"I'm Just Sad."

44:00.271 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was like, that's really what
it all is.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:04.609 --> 44:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Leading the
discussion was
the program's host, Trevor Noah.

44:07.712 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: That's where, as a
South African,
we share the same value in terms
of, the whole

44:11.682 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point of democracy is that we
don't fight
about the decision.

44:16.053 --> 44:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a scary time, but I think
we have to
be careful to not brand either
side in any

44:22.293 --> 44:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
discussion as a monolith.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a lot more nuanced than it
seems.

44:26.030 --> 44:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of the time, as
people, we're not
good at dealing with nuance.

44:29.534 --> 44:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's easier to say black and
white, right
and wrong.

44:32.069 --> 44:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Out with the old,
and in with
the new.

44:35.072 --> 44:37.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: Do you realize
there are so many
things we don't know?

44:37.708 --> 44:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't even know what the J.
in Donald J.
Trump stands for.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:42.146 --> 44:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: A lot of people
don't know this,
but it actually stands for
Jesus.

44:44.715 --> 44:45.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:47.552 --> 44:51.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the
32-year-old Noah is
still the new guy here, taking
over last year

44:51.322 --> 44:52.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as the surprise pick...

44:52.323 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: I am a terrible
employee.

44:54.158 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... to replace
Jon Stewart,
who after 16 years at the helm
was a national

44:59.096 --> 45:00.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cultural figure.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: I was surprised
with everyone
else.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

45:02.567 --> 45:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: It's not like I
wasn't surprised.

45:04.101 --> 45:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was also like, wow, who is
that guy?

45:05.903 --> 45:06.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is insane.

45:06.904 --> 45:08.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who is that guy?

45:08.639 --> 45:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only an idiot would take the job
after Jon
Stewart, but, luckily, I was
that idiot.

45:12.777 --> 45:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It hasn't been
the easiest
transition.

45:17.448 --> 45:22.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The late-night field has become
more crowded,
and "The Daily Show" numbers
have fallen.

45:22.687 --> 45:28.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with the help of a staff of
more than
100, Noah has brought a very
particular perspective,

45:28.326 --> 45:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one he thinks may be especially
useful now.

45:30.761 --> 45:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: I come from a world
where I have
always practiced empathizing and
putting myself

45:37.635 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in somebody else's mind, which
is very difficult
to do.

45:42.306 --> 45:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I truly believe that most
people are doing
what they believe is right from
their point

45:48.713 --> 45:50.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of view.

45:50.448 --> 45:53.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you think of it from
another person's
point of view and you think of
them being

45:53.918 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right from their point of view,
it then gives
you a greater insight into not
only why they

45:59.624 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think the way they do, but maybe
how to speak
to them or even how to argue
against those

46:04.462 --> 46:06.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
points.

46:06.464 --> 46:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trevor Noah was
born in Johannesburg,
South Africa, in the last years
of apartheid,

46:10.167 --> 46:15.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a time when a child like
himself, son of a
black South African woman and a
white Swiss

46:15.706 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
father, was, literally, as the
title of his
new memoir puts it, born a
crime.

46:20.378 --> 46:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: I existed in a
space where there
was no one like me most of my
life.

46:24.215 --> 46:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I never met a child who had
parents who were
different races.

46:29.053 --> 46:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I grew up either in a black
environment, or
I got to visit a white
environment.

46:33.424 --> 46:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Noah was raised
by his mother,
who was jailed several times for
breaking

46:37.261 --> 46:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apartheid era laws, and he spent
much of his
earliest life indoors, to hide
him from a

46:42.767 --> 46:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government that could take him
away and imprison
her.

46:46.137 --> 46:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: I lived as an
outsider, but,
at the same time, one of the
biggest benefits

46:50.274 --> 46:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, you never see yourself as
being the most
important thing, because the
world is never

46:54.478 --> 46:56.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yours.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what you have to do is, you
have to find
your place in other people's
worlds.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how do you do
that?

47:00.651 --> 47:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You use this word chameleon,
right?

47:02.186 --> 47:03.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TREVOR NOAH: Yes.

47:03.254 --> 47:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's how you
adapted.

47:04.722 --> 47:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: That's what you do,
and you do
that by listening, you know?

47:07.491 --> 47:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, that's what a
chameleon is doing,
for all intents and purposes.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's listening to its
environment and adapting
accordingly.

47:13.564 --> 47:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the chameleon's not aware of
the color
of the leaf that it's on, then
how will it

47:17.568 --> 47:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know what color to turn to?

47:19.270 --> 47:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the book, Noah
tells of
his mother having to act as
though she was

47:22.973 --> 47:28.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the black maid to her
light-skinned child,
and of his father running away
from him as

47:28.446 --> 47:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if they were not related.

47:29.714 --> 47:31.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Did you realize what was
happening at the
time?

47:32.016 --> 47:32.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: No, I didn't.

47:33.017 --> 47:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, thankfully, I didn't.

47:34.752 --> 47:39.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents were really good at
insulating
me from the reality of the world
that I was

47:39.390 --> 47:40.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

47:40.391 --> 47:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My dad, to me, wasn't running
away from me.

47:42.626 --> 47:44.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was just running with me.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My mom was playing.

47:47.064 --> 47:48.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My dad was playing.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was playing.

47:49.767 --> 47:51.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there was a
point where
you realized that that wasn't
play.

47:51.836 --> 47:53.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TREVOR NOAH: Yes.

47:53.237 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, I mean, by the time I did,
the country
was changing so much.

47:55.639 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm lucky in that -- and I
never take
that away.

47:58.976 --> 48:05.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never discount the fact that I
was extremely
lucky, because, when I started
to come of

48:05.216 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
age, when I was 6 years old, the
laws of apartheid
were officially abolished.

48:11.722 --> 48:14.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was 10 years old, we had
our first
democratic election.

48:14.959 --> 48:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was the greatest gift for
me, is that
I got to live on all sides.

48:18.562 --> 48:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some who have only lived through
the pain,
even when the country changed,
could only

48:22.600 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feel the pain.

48:24.068 --> 48:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some who exist beyond that don't
feel a connection
to a previous world.

48:28.906 --> 48:34.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He would become a
major star
in his homeland as a stand-up
comedian and

48:34.712 --> 48:37.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hosting his own late-night show.

48:37.148 --> 48:40.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He began making guest
appearances on American
shows.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON STEWART, Host, "The Daily
Show With Jon
Stewart": Trevor!

48:42.920 --> 48:44.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

48:44.755 --> 48:47.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, in 2014,
joined "The Daily
Show With Jon Stewart" as a
contributor.

48:47.958 --> 48:52.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Humor, he says, was and is a way
to process
the world.

48:52.596 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: No matter how poor
you are, no
matter how much pain you're in,
laughter is

48:57.434 --> 48:59.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something you always have.

48:59.804 --> 49:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the anesthetic of the mind,
I feel, because,
no matter what you're going
through, if you

49:06.143 --> 49:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laugh just for a moment, there's
a moment
of respite.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What now?

49:11.048 --> 49:12.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jokes, for sure.

49:12.917 --> 49:15.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: Instead, we got
someone who walks
around the White House like a
toddler at a

49:15.653 --> 49:16.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
space museum.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's this?

49:17.655 --> 49:18.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's this?

49:18.656 --> 49:20.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:20.457 --> 49:22.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Noah told me
he'd quickly
realized the demand from "The
Daily Show"

49:23.027 --> 49:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
audience for more than that.

49:24.862 --> 49:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while he speaks of trying to
see all sides
of a picture, he's also now
drawing a harsh

49:30.034 --> 49:31.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
analogy to his homeland.

49:31.869 --> 49:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: Remember, when I
first started
hosting "The Daily Show," I said
Donald Trump

49:35.539 --> 49:37.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reminds me of an African
dictator.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we had the evidence to back
it up.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I'm the one who has got the
money.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I made
a tremendous amount of money.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: My people have great praise
for me.

49:46.183 --> 49:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: People love me.

49:47.618 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody loves me.

49:49.353 --> 49:53.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR NOAH: The world I come
from is a world
of people who grab power off the
backs of

49:53.324 --> 49:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who are disenfranchised or
feel like
they have been left behind and
undereducated.

49:56.894 --> 50:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have come from a world where
the person
who is uneducated or the person
who is unqualified

50:03.267 --> 50:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can become the leader who takes
everything.

50:06.270 --> 50:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I come from a world where they
use hateful
rhetoric to try and rise up the
masses and

50:10.774 --> 50:11.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get them behind them.

50:11.775 --> 50:13.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I come from that world.

50:13.177 --> 50:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that world doesn't make
sense here, and
yet now it does.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to "The Daily Show."

50:18.048 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am Trevor Noah!

50:19.717 --> 50:25.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Comedy
Central in New
York City, I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS

50:25.322 --> 50:27.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

50:28.025 --> 50:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to another
episode of
Brief But Spectacular, where we
ask interesting

50:36.734 --> 50:38.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe their
passions.

50:38.602 --> 50:43.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Bob
Mankoff, cartoon
editor for "The New Yorker"
magazine since

50:43.173 --> 50:44.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1997.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He explains the humor of
cartoons.

50:46.744 --> 50:49.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB MANKOFF, Cartoon Editor,
"The New Yorker":
Every once in a while, we run a
joke that

50:49.813 --> 50:53.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very few people get, and I think
that's the
hallmark of "The New Yorker."

50:53.050 --> 50:54.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't actually do it to annoy
people.

50:54.985 --> 51:01.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spend an extraordinary amount
of time selecting,
going through and editing the
cartoons that

51:01.859 --> 51:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you end up finding not funny.

51:04.628 --> 51:06.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:06.430 --> 51:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB MANKOFF: Part of what is
wonderful about
cartoons is, they're a little
stupid, and

51:15.940 --> 51:20.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they connect us with the
stupidity of our
own consciousness in life.

51:20.544 --> 51:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are ribbing ourselves, our
own pretensions,
our own middle class.

51:24.648 --> 51:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in doing that, of course, we
become connoisseurs
of unhappiness.

51:28.585 --> 51:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cartoonists' relationship to
rejection depends
on the cartoonist.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An amateur loves everything they
do and think
everything is perfect.

51:35.926 --> 51:40.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A professional really
understands that, in
the end, somebody else has to
judge their

51:40.431 --> 51:42.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

51:42.266 --> 51:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often something that comes out
of your own
real-life experience, you don't
directly use.

51:45.569 --> 51:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You modify it within the form.

51:47.371 --> 51:49.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was on the phone and someone
was brushing
me off.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I just said to them, how
about never?

51:51.809 --> 51:52.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is never good for you?

51:53.010 --> 51:55.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then I tweaked it to make it
into a cartoon.

51:55.546 --> 51:59.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That has the syntax of
politeness, and yet
the message is rude.

51:59.516 --> 52:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that duality is really the
essence of
humor, that type of surprise.

52:05.022 --> 52:09.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One that has this deep pathos of
how life
is, is Roz Chast.

52:09.560 --> 52:15.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a man looking at the
obituary and says,
"Three years older than you, two
years younger

52:15.099 --> 52:17.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than you, your age right on the
dot."

52:17.301 --> 52:21.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's one I always show,
Michael Crawford,
French army knife with all
corkscrews, the

52:21.271 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
perfect cognitive cartoon.

52:23.574 --> 52:28.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bruce Eric Kaplan is just a
master of a single
line.

52:29.013 --> 52:33.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These two mothers and they have
their children
and one is saying to the other,
"They grow

52:33.584 --> 52:34.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up so slow."

52:35.019 --> 52:37.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of the functions is coping.

52:37.588 --> 52:40.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can whistle past the
graveyard, but I
think you're better off if you
laugh.

52:40.958 --> 52:45.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After 9/11, everybody said irony
is dead,
everything has changed, we're
all going to

52:45.262 --> 52:46.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be great and good.

52:46.764 --> 52:51.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bruce Eric Kaplan cartoon
came just a
couple of months after 9/11.

52:51.135 --> 52:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One woman is saying to another,
"It's hard,
but, slowly, I'm getting back to
hating everyone."

52:56.106 --> 53:00.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You just need a little something
to say, well,
we're living again, life is
going to go on,

53:00.844 --> 53:05.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, if life is going to go on,
humor is going
to go on.

53:05.149 --> 53:09.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Bob Mankoff, and this is my
Brief But
Spectacular take on cartoons.

53:09.653 --> 53:12.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sometimes, you
need a good
reason to laugh.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We do.

53:14.324 --> 53:17.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can watch
additional
Brief But Spectacular episodes
on our Web

53:17.127 --> 53:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

53:19.063 --> 53:24.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the
"NewsHour" online
right now: A lawyer and
professor who specializes

53:24.334 --> 53:29.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in public interest law says he
