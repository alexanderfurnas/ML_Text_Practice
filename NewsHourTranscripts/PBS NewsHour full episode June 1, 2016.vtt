HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is in Elkhart,
Indiana.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: She
sits down with
President Obama to talk about
the economic

00:13.647 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recovery and politics, among
other things,
followed by a town hall meeting.
We will have

00:17.351 --> 00:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a preview of the exclusive
interview.

00:20.454 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And getting humans to Mars. A
new inflatable
space pod could be a big step in
any mission

00:24.791 --> 00:26.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Red Planet.

00:26.727 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also ahead, could you afford
$400 in an
emergency? Judy Woodruff talks
with writer

00:31.365 --> 00:34.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neal Gabler about Americans'
financial fragility.

00:34.868 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, when a major earthquake in
Nepal took
8,000 lives, it also destroyed
some of the

00:39.439 --> 00:44.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country's history -- a look at
the clashes
over saving Nepal's monuments
and temples.

00:44.511 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.185 --> 00:54.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.988 --> 01:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama launched
an election-year effort today to
undercut

01:03.664 --> 01:09.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican claims that the
country is in decline.
He said it's not borne out by
the facts, but

01:09.069 --> 01:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he acknowledged Americans are
feeling stressed.

01:11.872 --> 01:15.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He spoke in an exclusive
interview with Gwen
Ifill, at a "PBS NewsHour" town
hall in Elkhart,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Indiana.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
When we have gone through a
tough time -- and

01:20.480 --> 01:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we went through worst financial
crisis in
our lifetimes.

01:22.849 --> 01:28.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm looking around. And I think
it's safe
to say that it's been the worst
in the lifetimes

01:28.722 --> 01:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or memories of most people here.
Then you
feel nervous. A lot of times,
it's easy for

01:34.695 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody to come up and say, you
know what,
if we deport all the immigrants
and build

01:39.633 --> 01:50.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wall, or if we cut off trade
with China,
or if we do X or Y or Z, that
there's some

01:50.811 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simple answer and, suddenly,
everything's
going to feel secure.

01:54.314 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The town hall
will air this
evening as a "PBS NewsHour"
special. And we

01:58.151 --> 02:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have an extended excerpt of
Gwen's interview
with the president after the
news summary.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
presidential
race was dominated by questions
about Trump

02:05.993 --> 02:11.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University, Donald Trump's
defunct real estate
seminar business. Two lawsuits
charge it defrauded

02:11.498 --> 02:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
customers, and newly released
court documents
include instructions to Trump
employees to

02:16.470 --> 02:18.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
use high-pressure tactics.

02:18.338 --> 02:22.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Newark, New Jersey, today,
Democrat Hillary
Clinton charged it's more
evidence that the

02:22.609 --> 02:25.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican nominee-to-be is a
fraud.

02:25.045 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He is trying to scam America,
the way he scammed

02:30.984 --> 02:41.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all those people at Trump U.
It's important
that we recognize what he has
done, because

02:41.061 --> 02:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's usually a pretty good
indicator of
what he will do.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump didn't
immediately
respond, but he has said that
most people

02:48.301 --> 02:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who took the seminars were
satisfied. He's
also accused the San Diego judge
who released

02:52.205 --> 02:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the documents of being hostile
to him. That
judge now says some of the
material was released

02:57.110 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by mistake, and must be resealed
until sections
can be blacked out.

03:02.716 --> 03:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flooding fueled by heavy rain
swept across
more of the Texas countryside
today. Several

03:06.720 --> 03:12.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rivers surged over their banks,
and evacuation
orders went out to a series of
towns. Houston's

03:12.559 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
southwestern suburbs braced for
the worst
as the Brazos River hit record
highs and kept

03:17.330 --> 03:19.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MYERS, Texas: Very scary
watching the
water just rise so fast. I mean,
it came up

03:21.201 --> 03:23.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so fast. I couldn't believe it.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Entire
communities and their
roadways are now submerged by
the flooded

03:27.074 --> 03:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
river, and many homes have been
turned into
islands. Hundreds of people who
live in them

03:32.145 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been forced to flee, but
others are cut
off.

03:36.316 --> 03:41.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials have carried out more
than 120 boat
rescues across Fort Bend County,
including

03:41.121 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this one in Rosenberg. Police in
the nearby
city of Richmond warned there's
more to come.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. LOWELL NEINAST, Richmond
Police Department:
This river is going to stay high
throughout

03:48.562 --> 03:54.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rest of the week and into
the weekend.
So we're going to have some --
this is going

03:54.334 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be awhile.

03:56.136 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the same
time, major
flooding has paralyzed parts of
North Texas.

04:00.207 --> 04:06.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trinity River is on the rise
IN Dallas.
Floodwaters have also engulfed
Granbury, outside

04:06.613 --> 04:12.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fort Worth. Now, with up to 10
more inches
of rain in the forecast, much of
Texas is

04:12.185 --> 04:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under a flash flood watch.

04:14.488 --> 04:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From flood to fire: The people
of Fort McMurray,
Canada, began returning home
today, for the

04:18.592 --> 04:23.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first time since a wildfire
roared through
one month ago. A trickle of
traffic brought

04:23.396 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evacuees back into the town in
Alberta today.
They were told to bring up to
two weeks of

04:29.002 --> 04:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supplies, as basic services have
yet to be
restored. The fire destroyed
2,400 buildings,

04:33.707 --> 04:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 10 percent of the city and
forced 80,000
people to flee.

04:37.611 --> 04:43.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A French company says its search
vessel has
picked up black box signals from
an EgyptAir

04:43.383 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plane that crashed last month.
They came from
deep in the Mediterranean Sea,
near the plane's

04:47.787 --> 04:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last known location, north of
Alexandria,
Egypt. The flight disappeared on
May 19, with

04:52.692 --> 04:57.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
66 people on board. Search teams
have found
debris, but the cause of the
crash remains

04:57.764 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unclear.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Children's Fund warned
today that
20,000 Iraqi children are caught
in the fighting

05:03.603 --> 05:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Fallujah. They're among some
50,000 civilians
trapped there. The warning came
as government

05:08.575 --> 05:12.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
forces ran into fierce
resistance from Islamic
State militants.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
visited the
front line and said the military
is trying

05:16.783 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to safeguard Fallujah's people.

05:19.119 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (through
translator): The enemy has been
denied most

05:24.024 --> 05:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the chances to flee. But many
civilians
are still there. The main target
of the operation

05:29.529 --> 05:34.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is to reduce the number of
victims among
civilians and also to decrease
losses among

05:34.634 --> 05:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our armed forces. We may raise
the Iraqi flag
inside Fallujah in the coming
few days.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite that
prediction,
it's widely expected that the
fight for Fallujah

05:43.109 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could go on for some time.

05:45.445 --> 05:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Somalia, Islamist Al-Shabaab
militants
stormed a hotel in Mogadishu,
killing at least

05:49.516 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six people and taking a number
of hostages.
The dead included two members of
Parliament.

05:54.154 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack began when a suicide
bomber blew
up his vehicle in front of the
hotel's entrance,

05:58.391 --> 06:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving burning wreckage.
Several gunmen then
stormed in. It's the latest in a
series of

06:03.330 --> 06:05.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such attacks.

06:05.298 --> 06:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, federal
officials announced
they won't charge two
Minneapolis policemen

06:08.602 --> 06:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with civil rights violations for
killing a
black man last November;
24-year-old Jamar

06:13.506 --> 06:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clark was shot during a struggle
with the
white officers. It sparked weeks
of protests,

06:17.611 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with demonstrators claiming
Clark was handcuffed
when he was shot. But the U.S.
attorney says

06:22.048 --> 06:23.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the evidence suggests he wasn't.

06:23.984 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW LUGER, U.S. Attorney,
District of Minnesota:
Given the lack of bruising, the
lack of Mr.

06:29.122 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clark's DNA on the handcuffs and
the deeply
conflicted testimony about
whether he was

06:34.494 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handcuffed, we determined that
we could not
pursue this case based on a
prosecution theory

06:40.634 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Mr. Clark was handcuffed at
the time
that he was shot.

06:44.037 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Earlier this
year, a state
prosecutor also declined to file
charges in

06:48.241 --> 06:49.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Clark's death.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, a former
volunteer
sheriff's deputy faces four
years in prison

06:53.580 --> 06:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for fatally shooting an unarmed
suspect last
year. Robert Bates is 74. He was
sentenced

06:58.351 --> 07:03.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tuesday in Tulsa for
second-degree manslaughter.
Bates killed Eric Harris during
a sting involving

07:03.690 --> 07:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illegal gun sales. He has said
he meant to
use a stun gun, but grabbed his
handgun by

07:09.229 --> 07:11.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mistake.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street struggled today to
eke out small
gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average was

07:14.134 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up just two points to close at
17789. The
Nasdaq rose four points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added

07:20.674 --> 07:22.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
two.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And an excavation in London has
unearthed
the oldest handwritten document
ever found

07:25.945 --> 07:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Britain. The Roman tablet
dates from 57
A.D., just 14 years after the
city was founded.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turned up during construction
of a new
headquarters for media giant
Bloomberg. In

07:35.955 --> 07:41.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all, more than 400 wooden
tablets were found,
including one with the earliest
written reference

07:41.828 --> 07:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to London. The records refer to
everything
from beer deliveries to legal
rulings.

07:46.666 --> 07:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Gwen Ifill
sits down with the president,
and we get the

07:50.804 --> 07:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analysis of Mark Shields and
David Brooks;
a NASA mission to create an
inflatable space

07:55.775 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pod; why nearly half of
Americans don't have
$400 for an emergency; and much
more.

08:05.885 --> 08:11.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pod; why nearly half of
Americans don't have
$400 for an emergency; and much
more.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now back to Gwen in Elkhart,
Indiana.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here's more from her
wide-ranging interview
with the president.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Many people,
including probably
some folks in this room...

08:20.367 --> 08:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Yes.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... think the
deficits have gone
up and the jobless rate has gone
up, and,

08:24.637 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, that their lives have
not improved.

08:27.574 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How -- in fact, we have the
nominee for -- the
presumptive nominee for the
Republican Party

08:32.912 --> 08:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, Donald Trump, saying
America is a
Third World nation. How do you
persuade or,

08:39.486 --> 08:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suppose, how does your likely
Democratic
successor, possible, persuade
anybody that's

08:45.125 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not true?

08:46.926 --> 08:50.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Well, it's
important you said
my successor, because Michelle
would be very

08:50.563 --> 08:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
upset if she thought I was
running again.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:54.768 --> 09:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Look, you just
look at the evidence
here in Elkhart, as you
mentioned in the introduction.

09:00.974 --> 09:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I took office, this was the
first city
I came to.

09:06.079 --> 09:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unemployment about a month
after I took
office, a month-and-a-half after
I took office,

09:13.153 --> 09:20.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was almost 20 percent. One out
of 10 people
were behind on their mortgage or
in foreclosure.

09:20.460 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the unemployment rate is
around 4 percent.
It's only about one in 30 people
who are behind

09:28.468 --> 09:30.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on their mortgage.

09:30.270 --> 09:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the R.V. industry, which is
central to
Elkhart, is on track to break
records in terms

09:37.444 --> 09:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sales. And so that doesn't
mean that folks
aren't struggling in some
circumstances. And

09:45.218 --> 09:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the things that I have
emphasized is
that there are some long-term
trends in the

09:49.956 --> 09:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy that we have to tackle,
in terms of
wages not going up as fast as
they used to,

09:55.428 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some big costs, like college
costs or health
care costs, that are still a
challenge, people

10:00.700 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still worrying about retirement.

10:03.970 --> 10:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're going to have to
make sure that
we make some good decisions
going forward.

10:11.177 --> 10:19.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the notion that somehow
America is in
decline is just not borne out by
the facts.

10:20.019 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But it resonates. It
resonates.
There are a lot of aggrieved
people who are

10:24.057 --> 10:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voting in big numbers for Donald
Trump.

10:26.593 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Well, look, the --
I think that
what has always been true in
American politics

10:32.298 --> 10:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that, when we have gone
through a tough
time -- and we went through the
worst financial

10:40.073 --> 10:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crisis of our lifetimes. I'm
looking around.

10:42.108 --> 10:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's safe to say
that it's been
the worst in the lifetimes or
memories of

10:47.981 --> 10:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most people here. Then you feel
nervous.

10:53.019 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People lost homes. People lost
savings. People
were worried about whether or
not they could

11:01.895 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make ends meet. And so worse --
even though
we have recovered, people feel
like the ground

11:10.169 --> 11:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under their feet isn't quite as
solid.

11:13.439 --> 11:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in those circumstances, a
lot of times,
it's easy for somebody to come
up and say,

11:17.977 --> 11:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know what, if we deport all
the immigrants
and build a wall, or if we cut
off trade with

11:26.753 --> 11:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China, or if we do X or Y or Z,
that there's
some simple answer and,
suddenly, everything's

11:34.894 --> 11:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to feel secure. And...

11:36.296 --> 11:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why don't you
mention Donald Trump
by name?

11:38.298 --> 11:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: You know, he seems
to do a good
job mentioning his own name.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:43.803 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, I figure, you
know, I will
let him do his advertising for
him.

11:46.606 --> 11:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you consider at
all that any
of the support for him is
backlash against

11:50.877 --> 11:52.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you personally?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Well, here is one
thing I would
say.

11:55.682 --> 12:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just spoke about this at
the local high
school. I think Trump is a more
colorful character

12:04.424 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
than some of the other
Republican elected
officials.

12:09.028 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of the story that he's
telling is
entirely consistent with what
folks have been

12:14.267 --> 12:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying about me or the general
story they
have been telling about the
economy for the

12:20.173 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last seven-and-a-half, the last
10, the last
20, the last 30 years.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we pick it
up from there
with "NewsHour" regulars,
syndicated columnist

12:26.846 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not Friday, but we are
happy to have
you here.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of those comments, what stood
out to you?

12:33.252 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What struck me was
the president
was making the case for his
eight years in

12:38.691 --> 12:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
office, that the change had been
improvement.

12:42.362 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And implicit is a recognition
that Donald
Trump's candidacy is not simply
a rejection

12:50.069 --> 12:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of President Obama's two terms.
It would be
a repudiation of him. And even
though, with

12:55.875 --> 13:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen's baiting, he wouldn't say
his name or
was very reluctant to say Donald
Trump a name,

13:01.814 --> 13:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the president recognizes
that.

13:03.583 --> 13:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think was sort of -- he is
champing
at the bit to get in the
campaign.

13:07.086 --> 13:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First on the
repudiation point,
his -- David Axelrod, his former
strategist,

13:12.291 --> 13:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made this point months and
months ago, that
each election, people tend to
have a psychological

13:16.462 --> 13:18.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shift to the opposite
personality type.

13:18.898 --> 13:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we went from the gut George
W. Bush, to
from the head Barack Obama, and
now from Obama,

13:24.937 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to from the wherever
Donald Trump.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:29.609 --> 13:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so they are
radically different
personality types. And I do
think there is

13:32.011 --> 13:35.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something for Axelrod's point,
that people
always look for something
different.

13:35.148 --> 13:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the economic point, I think
he's right
and wrong. He's right about the
gross numbers,

13:39.852 --> 13:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the unemployment rate is
coming down,
job creation has been pretty
good. But it

13:43.823 --> 13:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a two-tier thing. If you look
at manufacturing,
especially over the last 19
months, it's just

13:48.828 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been hit. It's been hit by weak
demand from
abroad, so many countries in
recession.

13:52.198 --> 13:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been hit by high dollar.
And so those
sort of industrial places in
places like Elkhart,

13:58.738 --> 14:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan, Upstate New York,
Central Pennsylvania,
those manufacturing sectors have
been worse

14:04.444 --> 14:08.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off now than they were even a
couple of years
ago because of sort of weak
manufacturing.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, what
about this idea
there is a disconnect? Gwen
brings it up.

14:12.618 --> 14:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also we had it on our Web
site with different
conversations that we had from
the people

14:16.255 --> 14:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were in this town hall,
that the president
can lay out his case, and here
are all the

14:20.893 --> 14:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economic numbers, here are the
facts, here
is what your unemployment was,
here is what

14:23.830 --> 14:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is now, but then you have
somebody that
stands up and says, you know
what, I used

14:26.966 --> 14:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work at a manufacturing
plant. And my job
is gone. What are you going to
do about it?

14:30.937 --> 14:37.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, that's right.
Carrier air
conditioning, which Donald Trump
played to

14:37.176 --> 14:41.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a fare-thee-well, quite
honestly, and understandably,
that they are leaving
Indianapolis and going

14:41.881 --> 14:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Mexico and taking the jobs
with it.

14:45.785 --> 14:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought he made a better case.
And it's
a sense of trying to remind
people, but it

14:51.858 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes down to, how do you feel?
I mean, President
Obama has a surprisingly good
job rating.

15:00.800 --> 15:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David mentioned George W. Bush.
George W.
Bush in the fall of 2008, when
John McCain

15:06.439 --> 15:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was trying to win the Republican
-- another
term for the Republican White
House, had a

15:11.377 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25 percent favorable rating.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is over 50. I
mean, he's got
a higher job rating. But people
don't feel

15:18.451 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good about the direction of the
country. And
I think that's real. And that's
partly Washington.

15:24.423 --> 15:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's partly Wall Street. Things
aren't working,
that nobody really cares that
the top 1 percent

15:31.063 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- I think there is a whole host
of factors
that contribute to that.

15:34.567 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president is -- he is
cerebral. He
makes a cerebral argument. But,
at a gut level,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it probably isn't as persuasive.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this -- is
this -- sorry,
you wanted...

15:46.512 --> 15:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I would just
say, it's
so regional.

15:48.314 --> 15:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you go to the Industrial
Midwest, yes,
it feels like that. It feels
bad. You go to

15:52.218 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bay Area, they're just
adding jobs at
a great rate. You go to
Nashville. Orlando

15:56.489 --> 16:03.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is back. Phoenix is back.
Houston is exploding.
And so the Sunbelt is back. And
the Sunbelt

16:03.196 --> 16:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was so badly hit in 2008, but
it's back.

16:05.865 --> 16:09.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Industrial Midwest is almost
in another
little downward hiccup.

16:09.235 --> 16:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Events like
this, I mean,
this -- there was a specific
reason he chose

16:13.306 --> 16:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elkhart. This was the first
place that he
visited after his presidency
began. He wants

16:17.577 --> 16:22.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to -- this is a kind of
legacy-solidifying
look at how much this place has
improved since

16:22.515 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have been in office, right?

16:24.450 --> 16:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it almost feels like, as
Mark said, almost
a campaign-style event to
solidify the legacy.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just reminder, I was pretty good
for the country.

16:33.159 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. It is not the
right moment
for that, probably.

16:37.129 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a moment when pessimism
is just en
vogue. And he's got numbers.
He's got numbers

16:43.502 --> 16:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his side overall, as I say,
but the country
is not in a mood to think it's
heading in

16:48.407 --> 16:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right track. There is almost
a near consensus
that we are not.

16:50.843 --> 16:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Those numbers are
pretty impressive.
It was at 19.6 percent
unemployment in Elkhart

16:56.649 --> 17:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he first went there, down
to 4 percent.
It is, once again, as it claimed
to be, the

17:01.687 --> 17:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
R.V., the recreation vehicle,
capital of the
world.

17:05.124 --> 17:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the mortgage and people who
are behind
in their mortgage payment or
facing foreclosure,

17:10.363 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was one out of 10 in 2009.
Now it's one
out of 30. I mean, those are all
improvements.

17:18.638 --> 17:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are all -- and you could
say, well,
it would have happened anyway,
it happened

17:22.375 --> 17:24.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in spite of.

17:24.343 --> 17:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he took some real actions
that were controversial
that cost him politically to do
it. And, you

17:31.484 --> 17:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, I think he's entitled to
take some credit
for the improvement.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
there were e-mails
going around today saying, you
know what,

17:38.524 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people of Elkhart succeeded
in spite of
the president.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. I think that
was governor,
Governor Mike Pence, I think.
The Republican

17:45.631 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governor is up for reelection
this year.

17:48.067 --> 17:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The test to me whether the
president is in
good shape or bad shape is that
Joe Donnelly,

17:53.639 --> 18:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic senator, was
there at the event.
He's up for reelection next
year, not this

18:00.780 --> 18:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. But, I mean, if you really
think that
somebody is Typhoid Mary
politically, you

18:06.652 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can think of creative reasons
not to be there.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other subcommittee
assignments that
you -- are going to keep you
busy. But the

18:12.758 --> 18:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that he was there with the
president
probably indicated to me that he
felt that

18:19.265 --> 18:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president would be a help,
rather than
a hindrance to his own career.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite the
fact that the
president wouldn't prefer to
name Donald Trump

18:27.807 --> 18:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out loud -- it is almost like he
is treating
him like a Harry Potter
character of Voldemort

18:31.043 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or something.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:33.746 --> 18:37.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump
is still right
in the news. And here we have a
possibility

18:37.850 --> 18:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where possibly two of the -- the
Republican
and the Democratic National
Committee kind

18:44.056 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nominees could have kind of
legal clouds
hanging over them or at least an
investigation

18:48.194 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hanging over them as they become
the nominees
and representatives of the party
for the presidency.

18:52.431 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, the
Trump thing in
the news today, my newspaper had
a good story

18:55.835 --> 18:57.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Trump University.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we sort of had the outlines
of the story,
but I think what was fresh in
some of the

19:01.741 --> 19:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new documents that we now have
access to is
the way that professors at Trump
University

19:07.146 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were really pressuring people to
get out their
credit cards, to get multiple
credit cards,

19:10.950 --> 19:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to max out their credit cards,
just to give
all this money to Trump
University, and then

19:14.520 --> 19:19.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they left these people high and
dry and deeply
in debt, offering them very
little in return.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it was the machinations of
scamming these
people that we learned today.

19:23.662 --> 19:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fair that
Hillary Clinton
says this means that my
competitor, my opponent

19:28.467 --> 19:29.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a fraud?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, if you
listen to the plaintiffs.

19:33.539 --> 19:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump did a
classic Donald
Trump defense, which is to
attack the judge,

19:40.913 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not -- who didn't bring the
case, who's hearing
the case. The judge isn't the
plaintiff. The

19:44.216 --> 19:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judge isn't saying he was
scammed or bilked.
The judge happens -- Judge
Gonzalo Curiel

19:51.457 --> 19:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happens to be of Latin descent.

19:55.161 --> 20:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump accused him of
having a vendetta
because of that. He is a native
of Indiana.

20:00.733 --> 20:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he -- you know, this is
classic, classic
Trump.

20:04.603 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But David's former employer, The
Wall Street
Journal editorial page, today
took him on

20:12.178 --> 20:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the politics of personal
grievance, that
he has an ability to personalize
things, in

20:19.318 --> 20:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addition to this legal case
today. I think
it is quite unparalleled in
presidential nominees.

20:24.190 --> 20:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mark Shields,
David Brooks, thanks so much.

20:38.037 --> 20:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first inflatable room in
space was attached
to the International Space
Station by NASA

20:42.808 --> 20:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Saturday. It's the beginning
of a two-year
test period for this expandable
habitat.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent Miles O'Brien
reports on this
new frontier in space travel as
part of our

20:52.051 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekly series about the Leading
Edge of science.

20:55.488 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: NASA just added
some space
to the space station, and it is
16 cubic meters

21:02.995 --> 21:10.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like no other. Inflated
carefully with short
spurts of air, it is an
expandable module,

21:10.936 --> 21:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first designed for human
habitation ever
to reach low-Earth orbit.

21:15.741 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a big step on the long road
to building
spacecraft and habitats for
human missions

21:20.846 --> 21:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Mars. Expandables allow
engineers to color
outside the lines, beyond the
diameter of

21:30.890 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Mars. Expandables allow
engineers to color
outside the lines, beyond the
diameter of

21:36.095 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nose cone of the rocket
called the fairing.
That's the constraint when
launching a module

21:40.766 --> 21:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made of rigid aluminum. It's
sort of like
carrying a tent to space.

21:46.205 --> 21:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason Crusan is NASA's director
for advanced
exploration systems.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON CRUSAN, NASA Director for
Advanced Exploration
Systems: Expandables allow you
to pack up

21:52.344 --> 21:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever your habitat is and fit
in more potential
volume in the same fairing
volume. So that's

21:58.284 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the key advantage, is the volume
advantage.

22:00.286 --> 22:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's called BEAM,
an acronym
for Bigelow Expandable Activity
Module. It's

22:06.792 --> 22:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a technology demonstrator, an
experiment to
see how well it performs in
space.

22:12.231 --> 22:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man behind BEAM, Robert
Bigelow, watched
it all unfold in the viewing
room overlooking

22:17.503 --> 22:23.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the space station flight control
room in Houston.
His company, Bigelow Aerospace,
is based in

22:23.409 --> 22:24.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Las Vegas.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, so what are we
looking at here?

22:26.845 --> 22:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bigelow made his fortune in real
estate, contracting
and extended stay hotels. He is
now pursuing

22:33.152 --> 22:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lifelong passion for space. He
believes
expandables are a game-changer.

22:37.957 --> 22:42.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BIGELOW, Bigelow
Aerospace: It's that
dramatic. It's that huge in
terms of concept

22:42.428 --> 22:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change. We didn't invent the
change. This
is a NASA idea.

22:46.098 --> 22:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It is an idea as
old as the
space age itself. In a seminal
series on space

22:52.304 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exploration in "Collier's"
magazine in 1954,
legendary rocket scientist
Wernher von Braun

22:59.411 --> 23:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
envisioned humans flying to, and
living on,
Mars in inflatables.

23:07.519 --> 23:14.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The first communications
satellites, Echo
1 and Echo 2, launched in 1960
and '64 respectively,

23:14.960 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were inflatable metallic
balloons, passive
reflectors of microwave
transmissions. At

23:20.499 --> 23:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the same time, NASA
pondered several
early space station designs with
expandable

23:26.538 --> 23:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
modules. And in the 1990s, when
the International
Space Station was becoming a
reality, the

23:32.578 --> 23:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agency designed an expandable
called TransHab
that would have replaced the
U.S. crew quarters.

23:38.550 --> 23:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Expanded, it would have twice
the diameter,
and three times the volume, of
the rigid aluminum

23:43.555 --> 23:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
structure currently in use. But
amid cost
overruns, Congress canceled
TransHab. And

23:50.296 --> 23:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bigelow Aerospace obtained the
patents from
NASA.

23:53.232 --> 23:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: When I saw that
architecture
and that whole idea, I was
enchanted by that

23:58.871 --> 24:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concept, and I thought, that's
something that
really looks cool and seems to
have a lot

24:04.243 --> 24:06.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of value.

24:06.178 --> 24:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In 2006 and 2007,
Bigelow successfully
deployed two expandable
structures slightly

24:11.650 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller than BEAM in low-Earth
orbit. Both
are still in space, and still
filled with

24:17.589 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
air.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: There are a lot
of fans of
this kind of architecture. So, I
think they're

24:21.527 --> 24:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
applicable anywhere in low-Earth
orbit and
on the surface of another body,
whether it's

24:26.198 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the moon or perhaps even Mars,
and certainly
for any kind of deep space
mission.

24:30.736 --> 24:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to have a lot of room
for people.
People need to have a lot of
space. They don't

24:36.475 --> 24:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to be cramped up for long
periods of
time.

24:39.044 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bigelow took me
on a tour of
his huge, pristine facility
filled with full-sized

24:44.516 --> 24:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mockups of his expansive vision
for space.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to Olympus?

24:49.388 --> 24:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: Yes. Yes.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A lot of volume
here.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: Yes, this could
be anything
that you could imagine.

24:55.294 --> 25:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Olympus would
have twice the
volume of the entire
International Space Station,

25:00.599 --> 25:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet could be delivered to
orbit in one
launch, albeit on a super heavy
rocket still

25:05.671 --> 25:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the drawing boards at NASA or
SpaceX.

25:09.041 --> 25:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, Bigelow has some big
ideas for this
very big space.

25:13.379 --> 25:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: So is it an
entertainment
center? Is it a
command-and-control center?

25:18.851 --> 25:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it a hospital? Are you
growing food? Is
it a hydroponic center? Is it a
dormitory?

25:24.223 --> 25:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you making -- is it a
manufacturing facility,
you're making all kinds of
things, or is it

25:29.395 --> 25:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an assembly facility, where you
are assembling
satellites and launching them
out the airlock?

25:35.601 --> 25:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But before
Olympus becomes
a reality, Bigelow would like to
attach a

25:40.139 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
module like this one to the
International
Space Station. He'd also like to
build his

25:44.943 --> 25:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own space station, which could
orbit the Earth,
moon or Mars.

25:49.915 --> 25:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He envisions his expandables as
orbiting time-shares
that can be used for
manufacturing and science

25:56.722 --> 26:02.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and as a destination for
emerging nations
hoping to fly their own
astronauts. Oh, and

26:02.828 --> 26:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't forget tourism. He is,
after all, a
hotel guy.

26:06.198 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BIGELOW: So, if somebody
wants to use
it for a hotel purpose, that's
fine. We will

26:10.803 --> 26:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lease that to them, and then
they can sublet
and sub-rent that out to
whomever.

26:15.874 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: BEAM and all the
rest of Bigelow's
expandables are made of several
layers of

26:20.579 --> 26:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vectran, a material stronger
than Kevlar,
which is used in bulletproof
vests. Over the

26:26.218 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next six months, astronauts will
only venture
into BEAM periodically to glean
data on the

26:31.490 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air quality, temperature,
condensation, radiation
and possible micro-meteoroid and
orbital debris

26:38.330 --> 26:40.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
impacts.

26:40.199 --> 26:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON CRUSAN: But, to be honest,
actually,
just the whole process of
developing and expansion

26:44.803 --> 26:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are even more critical to using
this in the
first place.

26:48.307 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: BEAM will remain
on the International
Space Station for two years.
Bigelow is seeking

26:54.112 --> 27:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permission from NASA to sell
access to the
craft to commercial, educational
and scientific

ROBERT BIGELOW: Some people may
think, well,
that's not any big deal. Well,
it is. It is

27:03.956 --> 27:05.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the start of something.

27:05.824 --> 27:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McDonald's started with one
burger somewhere,
right, someplace. OK? So, it all
has to have

27:11.497 --> 27:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a beginning. And this is what
BEAM is for
us, is it's a beginning, even if
it's on a

27:16.401 --> 27:18.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very small scale.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bigelow clearly
believes the
work in low-Earth orbit is just
the beginning

27:21.807 --> 27:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of creating a viable industry in
space, which,
in turn, could help NASA's goal
to land and

27:27.546 --> 27:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sustain humans on Mars. The
universe is ever
expanding, and so will the
spacecraft designed

27:34.586 --> 27:36.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to explore it.

Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," North Las
Vegas, Nevada.

27:45.464 --> 27:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

27:52.170 --> 27:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
rebuilding Nepal's
historic temples destroyed by a
catastrophic

27:57.042 --> 28:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earthquake; and how parents can
prepare for
the worst without scaring their
children.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But first:
financial fragility.

28:05.984 --> 28:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most American households did
slightly better
economically in 2015 than 2014,
according

28:10.489 --> 28:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a recent survey by the
Federal Reserve;
69 percent said they were living
comfortably

28:15.227 --> 28:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or doing OK, up from 65 percent.
But 31 percent
said they were either struggling
to get by

28:22.267 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or just getting by, a figure
that includes
millions of middle-class
Americans.

28:27.072 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it can be surprising to
learn just
which Americans continue to
struggle.

Judy Woodruff has the latest in
our series
with "The Atlantic."

28:34.246 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: By almost any
measure, Neal
Gabler has led a successful
life. He's published

28:42.054 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respected biographies of Walt
Disney, Barbra
Streisand, and Walter Winchell,
written for

28:48.427 --> 28:53.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leading newspapers and
magazines, taught at
prestigious universities.

28:53.832 --> 28:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a husband and the father of
two daughters,
now launched in their own
successful careers.

28:59.805 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives in New York's Long
Island enclave
the Hamptons, a place of natural
beauty and

29:06.111 --> 29:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mecca for wealth and celebrity.
And yet, for
years, Neal Gabler harbored a
mortifying secret.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER, Author/Journalist:
It's very
difficult. I will tell you who
it's really

29:15.554 --> 29:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been difficult on is my wife.

29:17.389 --> 29:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Being the writer
that he his,
Gabler decided to come to terms
with his secret

29:22.894 --> 29:24.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by writing about it.

29:24.663 --> 29:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: I never write about
myself. So
I didn't embark on this project
saying, oh,

29:27.899 --> 29:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gosh, I can't wait to write
about my own failures,
which is basically what the
article is about.

29:33.238 --> 29:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, the spring of this
piece was
reading a news item about the
Federal Reserve

29:40.278 --> 29:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
household economic survey, in
which they asked
the question, if you had a $400
emergency,

29:47.252 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could you meet that emergency?
And 47 percent
of the respondents said that
they couldn't

29:53.592 --> 29:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meet that emergency without
either having
to borrow money or to sell
something.

29:59.531 --> 30:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I read that item and I said
to myself,
well, who knew? But, of course,
I knew, because

30:05.837 --> 30:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many, many times in my life, and
not just
in the distant past, but in the
unfortunate

30:13.378 --> 30:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
present, I couldn't afford those
$400.

30:15.447 --> 30:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
hard truth.
Despite all his outward signs of
success,

30:21.820 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neal Gabler is frequently broke.
His recent
story in "The Atlantic" magazine
brought widespread

30:28.627 --> 30:30.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attention to that fact.

30:30.395 --> 30:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you hesitate at all about
baring your
personal life?

30:33.498 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: Very much so. I'm
not the kind
of person who really likes to
expose himself.

30:39.571 --> 30:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then that reluctance became
part of the
article itself, because I coined
the term

30:46.078 --> 30:48.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the article financial
impotence.

30:48.046 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it struck me that talking
about our financial
situation is very much like men
not wanting

30:54.619 --> 30:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about sexual impotence.
It's just
not something you do. It's an
embarrassment.

30:59.725 --> 31:06.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a shame. It's a
humiliation. And financial
problems are exactly the same
thing.

31:06.331 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought perhaps I can help
those people
who feel shamed and embarrassed
and humiliated

31:12.871 --> 31:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and show them, look it, I'm
willing to do
this. I'm willing to expose all
of my faults,

31:19.010 --> 31:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of my mistakes, all of my
failures. You're
not alone.

31:24.049 --> 31:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gabler knew he
wasn't alone
even before writing the article,
due to weekly

31:33.692 --> 31:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chats with Brian Brunjes (ph),
an East Hampton
butcher.

31:37.329 --> 31:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: Brian the butcher
is my friend.
He's a wonderful, easy guy to
talk to.

31:41.466 --> 31:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And gradually, over time, we
would start getting
our financial situation, very,
very rare,

31:47.305 --> 31:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly among men. And I
remember one
day especially, this was one of
those periods

31:53.678 --> 31:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where I didn't have the $400 --
and, unfortunately,
they come all too frequently.

31:57.449 --> 32:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, I'm going to tell
you something.
He said, I am in the same
situation. I have

32:02.387 --> 32:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got this expense and that
expense. If anybody
tells you that they're sailing
through, they're

32:08.393 --> 32:10.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lying.

32:10.228 --> 32:14.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRIAN BRUNJES, Butcher:
Everybody struggles.
I have a child with autism. He
was diagnosed

32:14.099 --> 32:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 years ago. My wife had to
stop working.
Became a one-income family. We
accumulated

32:22.440 --> 32:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of outside expenses. So, I
struggled.
But you know what, I got to do
what I got

32:28.046 --> 32:29.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

32:29.781 --> 32:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: And that was almost
the final
push to write the piece,
because, you know,

32:35.587 --> 32:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's right. There are so many
people in trouble.
They won't talk about it. Brian
is one of

32:42.093 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the very few who would be open
with me, and
I was able to be open with him
as a result.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we were able to share this.

32:49.868 --> 32:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN BRUNJES: It kind of like
took a weight
off my shoulder knowing that a
guy like Neal,

32:54.739 --> 32:59.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he's got a house in East
Hampton, you figure,
ah, you know, he's doing all
right for himself.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's not. Everybody's
struggling. And
it's tough.

33:02.747 --> 33:06.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EDWARD WOLFF, New York
University: The middle
class is in desperate straits.

33:06.618 --> 33:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Edward Wolff is a
professor
of economics at New York
University.

33:11.289 --> 33:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD WOLFF: Today, the average
family has
enough financial reserves to
keep going for

33:17.696 --> 33:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about three weeks. That's it.
And that's middle-income.
And if you go further down the
ladder, basically,

33:25.871 --> 33:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the financial reserves keep the
family going
for a couple days at most. And
so these financial

33:33.078 --> 33:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reserves are just completely
evaporated. It's
incredible.

33:35.814 --> 33:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNAMARIA LUSARDI, George
Washington University:
We came up with this word,
financial fragility,

33:42.287 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we thought of looking at
the capacity
of families to bear a shock, to
face a shock.

33:51.029 --> 33:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Annamaria Lusardi
is an economist
at George Washington University.

33:55.834 --> 34:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNAMARIA LUSARDI: And the way
we formulated
the question is, how confident
are you that

34:01.539 --> 34:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you could come up with $2,000 if
an unexpected
need arose within the next
month? And what

34:09.848 --> 34:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found is 40 percent of
families could not
come up with $2,000 in 30 days.
So it's important

34:17.656 --> 34:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to recognize that, that the
financial fragility
is just so widespread.

34:21.726 --> 34:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD WOLFF: The main reason is
that we have
had a long period of wage
stagnation in this

34:30.168 --> 34:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, even -- going further
back, even
to the mid-1970s.

34:35.006 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the face of stagnating
incomes, what
did families do? Well, for a
while they did

34:42.247 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accumulate wealth, and this was
buoyed by
the housing price boom of going
forward until

34:49.921 --> 34:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2006, and then suddenly the
housing market
collapsed, and so did net worth.

34:56.561 --> 35:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of what
you would
describe as your financial
condition is due

35:02.067 --> 35:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decisions that Neal Gabler
made, and how
much of it is due to outside
circumstances

35:08.006 --> 35:09.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beyond your control?

35:09.541 --> 35:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: That's a great
question, and
I want to take responsibility.

35:14.713 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't want to put everything
off on these
larger financial forces. I chose
to become

35:21.553 --> 35:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a writer. This is the most
financially perilous
profession that one can possibly
imagine,

35:26.825 --> 35:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
except possibly being an actor.

35:28.626 --> 35:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I chose to live in New York City
because I
thought I needed to be close to
magazines

35:35.767 --> 35:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and publishers that I needed for
my writing
career. So I did that. And New
York is expensive.

35:42.774 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I chose to have two children.
Children are
expensive.

35:46.978 --> 35:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I made the choice to send them
to expensive
colleges, so those were all
choices that I

35:53.218 --> 36:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made that had serious financial
consequences,
but, again, those choices were
what I call

36:00.158 --> 36:01.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

36:01.893 --> 36:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So many young
people today
are told, find your passion and
follow it.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like that's what you
did.

36:06.898 --> 36:13.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: That's exactly what
I did. I
followed my bliss, and I'm happy
I did. So,

36:13.138 --> 36:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I accept responsibility. On the
other hand,
since roughly half of Americans
are suffering

36:20.879 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same sort of financial
fragility I'm in,
we can't say that they're all
imbeciles.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have to say is that
there are forces
beyond our control.

36:32.657 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you a
couple of
other questions about personal
decisions you

36:37.262 --> 36:42.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
made. You brought it up
yourself, the decision
to live here. We're in East
Hampton. People

36:42.600 --> 36:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think, living in the Hamptons?
That's a really
expensive part of America.

36:46.771 --> 36:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: You know, when
people hear that
I live in the Hamptons, the
first thing they

36:49.474 --> 36:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say to me is, oh, my gosh, you
live in the
Hamptons.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What they don't really
understand is that
there are two Hamptons. There
are the people

36:58.616 --> 37:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who live here full time, as I
do, who are
not wealthy, and there are the
people who

37:05.023 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come here during the summer who
are.

37:06.958 --> 37:14.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I do live in the
Hamptons. And when
I bought this house, I could
afford it. It

37:14.632 --> 37:20.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't exorbitantly expensive. I
was able
to afford it for a very long
time.

37:20.872 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is all cedar, but you can
see how many
shingles are missing here.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. Right.
Right.

37:26.411 --> 37:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These days, though, the house
has fallen into
disrepair. It's in desperate
need of a new

37:31.182 --> 37:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
roof. Floorboards are rotting.
It has not
seen fresh paint in many years.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: If I had $100,000,
I could probably...

37:38.423 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You could get all
this done.

37:39.390 --> 37:40.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: I could probably
get it done.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. Yes.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you ever think about moving
to a less
expensive part of the country?

37:44.329 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: We did. And we have
talked about
that. But here's the catch-22 of
that. If

37:49.634 --> 37:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were -- once the recession
hit, the house
lost its value, as it did for
most Americans.

37:57.108 --> 38:04.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, now the house is
deteriorating, it's lost
its value. So if I had the
resources to fix

38:04.616 --> 38:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the house to sell it, I
wouldn't need to
sell it. That's the catch-22. I
am a financial

38:11.656 --> 38:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illiterate, and financial
illiterates pay
a heavy price for their
financial illiteracy.

38:17.495 --> 38:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gabler is not
using the term
financial illiteracy loosely.
It's a phenomenon

38:23.668 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economists say is a key factor
in the current
fragility of the middle class.

38:28.806 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNAMARIA LUSARDI: We measure
financial literacy
by looking at basic financial
knowledge. We

38:35.413 --> 38:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are experiencing much more
complex financial
markets, much more complex
financial products

38:42.287 --> 38:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than in the past. And the
knowledge of people
has not kept up.

38:47.559 --> 38:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL GABLER: Half of America
will have to
compromise on their dreams.

38:52.864 --> 38:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's one statistic that I
cite in the piece
from a USA Today survey which I
think is fascinating.

38:58.069 --> 39:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that survey determined that
a middle-class
existence in America would cost
$130,000.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A year.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL GABLER: A year.

39:08.213 --> 39:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The median income in America is
somewhere
around $50,000. So a
middle-class existence

39:17.055 --> 39:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was more than two times as great
as the median
income. And what that tells you
is that the

39:22.760 --> 39:30.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
face of financial fragility is
the face of
the college-educated, as well as
those without

39:30.535 --> 39:32.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a high school diploma.

39:32.337 --> 39:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the face of white America,
as well as
the face of minority Americans,
who obviously

39:38.376 --> 39:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffer much greater. This is an
equal opportunity
situation. It affects so many of
us. It's

39:45.850 --> 39:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great sadness to think that
people feel
compelled to give up their
dreams of what

39:52.390 --> 40:03.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they thought a modest
middle-class life would
be. But they have. They have.
Even I have.

40:03.901 --> 40:15.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: restoring
ancient cultural
treasures in earthquake-ravaged
Nepal.

40:15.947 --> 40:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A little more than one year ago,
a magnitude-7.8
tremor took 8,000 lives and
displaced hundreds

40:22.387 --> 40:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands. It also destroyed
historic temples
and religious monuments that are
classified

40:27.792 --> 40:29.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as World Heritage Sites.

40:29.761 --> 40:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our Culture at Risk
series, special
correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro
reports from

40:34.399 --> 40:36.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kathmandu.

40:36.334 --> 40:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Until now,
the major concern
in Nepal has been the
humanitarian response

40:42.507 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the slow pace of rebuilding,
as hundreds
of thousands of quake survivors
remain in

40:47.512 --> 40:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flimsy, temporary shelters.

40:50.548 --> 40:57.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, for historians,
archaeologists and even
tourism promoters, the
earthquake did extensive

40:57.221 --> 41:04.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damage to Nepal's historic
temples, structures
anywhere from 200 to 1,400 years
old.

41:04.462 --> 41:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN MANHART, UNESCO: The
temples of
Nepal are absolutely unique.
They have -- they

41:10.401 --> 41:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are inscribed on the World
Heritage list.
So, you will find such a dense
concentration

41:17.475 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cultural heritage in almost
no country
of the world. Also, it is an
exceptional mix

41:23.848 --> 41:28.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of religions. Many temples are
Hindu and Buddhist
at the same time.

41:28.853 --> 41:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Hinduism has
deep -- and
intersecting -- roots here with
Buddhism,

41:33.057 --> 41:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whose founder, Gautama Buddha,
was born in
what today is Nepal some 2,600
years ago.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rich cultural heritage is
also a living
one, says Christian Manhart of
the United

41:46.938 --> 41:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations cultural organization
UNESCO.

41:49.207 --> 41:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN MANHART: So it is not
just beautiful
monuments which are there for
tourists, but

41:56.147 --> 41:58.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they are used.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And that
adds more complication
to the rebuilding efforts,
already slowed

42:01.819 --> 42:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by bureaucracy and political
instability,
setting up a cultural a clash

42:06.257 --> 42:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR, Kathmandu
Valley Preservation
Trust: We don't have this
romanticism with

42:10.561 --> 42:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
historical patina. So this is,
you know, a
different way of looking at the
monument,

42:16.968 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a Westerner eye and as the
local people
here.

42:19.837 --> 42:24.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Rohit
Ranjitkar is with
a nonprofit organization called
the Kathmandu

42:24.242 --> 42:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Valley Preservation Trust. He
says, for most
Nepalis, these historic sites
are first and

42:29.947 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foremost places of active
worship.

42:32.383 --> 42:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: Basically, they
have the
attachment with the God and the
place with

42:37.822 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the religious activities, not
with the architecture.
You know, for them, the temple
will be rebuilt

42:47.565 --> 42:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not rebuilt. It does not make
any difference.

42:50.334 --> 42:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ranjitkar's
group has
been restoring temples here for
more than

42:54.138 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two decades, with funding mostly
from private
Western donors. He says the
trust's work likely

42:59.944 --> 43:02.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helped some structures withstand
the quake.

43:02.814 --> 43:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of this complex in the
Patan neighborhood
of the capital survived, and
it's become a

43:07.218 --> 43:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shelter for antiquities salvaged
from destroyed
temples.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: So, these all
rescued from
the rubble.

43:12.924 --> 43:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They are
among thousands
of icons, statues, and timbers
now housed

43:17.562 --> 43:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in makeshift storage until they
can be restored
to their original homes.

43:22.033 --> 43:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: This is one the
oldest sections
of the whole palace from 1627.

43:28.239 --> 43:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The temples
and monuments
are often part of royal palace
complexes.

43:34.111 --> 43:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's here that the delicate
balancing act
between Western or international
norms and

43:38.749 --> 43:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
local concerns comes into play.

43:41.519 --> 43:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is about 300 years old,
and this is...

43:44.188 --> 43:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: Last year.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Last year.

43:47.091 --> 43:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, Ranjitkar explained they
decided to
repair weathered 300-year-old
architectural

43:51.496 --> 43:57.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elements with brand-new work,
going against
the grain of many art historians
who would

43:57.034 --> 43:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have left the old damaged
structure as it
was.

43:59.871 --> 44:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: The people who
can still
do that, we need to promote
them. If we don't

44:05.376 --> 44:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do this, then this skill will
also be lost.

44:07.745 --> 44:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says one
priority is
to preserve the skills and
artisanship handed

44:12.583 --> 44:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the generations over
centuries, but disappearing
in a modern world economy.

44:19.457 --> 44:20.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Three days?

44:20.391 --> 44:21.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: Three days to
make this.

44:21.259 --> 44:23.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Wow.

44:23.361 --> 44:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The craftsmen mainly come from
lower socioeconomic
classes. Many have gone into
other work, notably

44:29.500 --> 44:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as laborers in the oil-rich Gulf
States.

44:34.872 --> 44:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also a shortage of
recorded information
to guide a rebuilding that's
faithful to the

44:39.343 --> 44:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
original temple design. Shukra
Sagar Shrestha,
a retired archaeologist, spends
much of his

44:45.816 --> 44:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time gathering old photographs,
documents,
and drawings to help the
artisans.

44:54.559 --> 44:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he studies the ancient
inscriptions and
intricate carvings on these
temple icons.

44:59.830 --> 45:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This series, for example, is a
kind of dos
and don'ts, he says, the path to
heaven or

45:04.535 --> 45:06.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hell in one's next life.

45:06.404 --> 45:11.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHUKRA SAGAR SHRESTHA,
Archaeologist: Because
you gave your daughter to marry,
but you accepted

45:11.175 --> 45:13.077 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

45:13.110 --> 45:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So he has
been put into
a cauldron of boiling water
because he accepted

45:18.382 --> 45:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a dowry for his daughter?

45:19.951 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHUKRA SAGAR SHRESTHA: Exactly.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Nepal's
government says
work will begin in the next few
months on

45:24.755 --> 45:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebuilding major sites that were
destroyed
with a target to finish in five
to seven years.

45:30.194 --> 45:32.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNESCO's Manhart is not sure.

45:32.330 --> 45:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN MANHART: We were quite
optimistic.
Directly after the earthquake,
there was so

45:35.733 --> 45:42.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
much solidarity from the
international community.
We thought, in six years, we
would be able

45:42.807 --> 45:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do it. But now we are tapping
for 10 years
to reconstruct most of this
heritage, if,

45:50.147 --> 45:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, the funding is
available.

45:52.049 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: All told,
about $205 million
will need to be raised, he says,
and there's

45:57.054 --> 46:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than enough to start.

46:01.626 --> 46:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, Ranjitkar says
here he leans
toward a more Western or
international preference,

46:07.331 --> 46:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repairing a lot of the woodwork,
instead of
replacing it.

46:10.067 --> 46:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT RANJITKAR: The local
people, they don't
like it. In our religion we
don't worship

46:16.474 --> 46:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
image which is broken or which
is chipped
out. So, when you have some
damage in the

46:23.180 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
image, so people normally
replace it with
a new one. They don't use the
old one.

46:27.585 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As the
rebuilding gets
into full swing, Ranjitkar plans
to spend

46:31.689 --> 46:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time with worshipers, trying to
convince them
of the virtue of the ancient
artisanship,

46:37.428 --> 46:41.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially to another set of
pilgrims to these
temples, tourists.

46:41.966 --> 46:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their reverence is mainly for
the historic
architectural patina and their
dollars a critical

46:47.471 --> 46:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
engine in the local economy.

46:49.106 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Kathmandu.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

46:57.815 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

46:59.550 --> 47:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A version of this story aired on
the PBS program
"Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly."

47:04.455 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the U.S. State
Department warned
travelers of the potential for
terror attacks

Yesterday, the U.S. State
Department warned
travelers of the potential for
terror attacks

47:19.470 --> 47:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe this summer. But for
many Americans,
the fear of terrorism is not
limited to threats

47:24.475 --> 47:26.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abroad.

47:26.277 --> 47:30.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
National security expert
Juliette Kayyem has
this essay on how parents and
children can

47:30.214 --> 47:33.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel safer at home in the face
of growing
anxieties.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIETTE KAYYEM, Former
Department of Homeland
Security Assistant Secretary:
"What am I supposed

47:35.152 --> 47:37.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to say?" a close friend asks me.

47:37.555 --> 47:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her daughter had just approached
her with
this question: "Mom, is ISIS in
New York City?"

47:43.728 --> 47:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My friend is looking for a
confidante, but
also for any confidence I can
deliver from

47:48.733 --> 47:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my professional vantage point,
as a homeland
security expert. It also doesn't
hurt that

47:53.404 --> 47:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a mother of three. My friend
wants me
to tell her everything is going
to be OK.

47:59.310 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I get it. I get that
irrational fear in
the back of our minds, that what
if, that,

48:04.415 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, I know the chances of some
random act
of violence or terror is
unlikely, but, still,

48:08.919 --> 48:16.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get it. Even a .0001 percent
statistical
likelihood still means someone
falls within

48:16.961 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, and what if that's my child?

48:19.463 --> 48:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here's the truth, brutal and
liberating:
There is no such thing as
perfect security,

48:25.136 --> 48:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no white flag that will be
raised, no future
world filled with unicorns and
rainbows. No

48:29.940 --> 48:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homeland defense apparatus is
going to make
perfect security attainable.

48:35.212 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government certainly has the
responsibility
to protect us, but in this day
and age of

48:39.650 --> 48:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
globalism, where we enjoy the
flow of people
and goods and ideas, we will
never get the

48:43.788 --> 48:51.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk to anywhere near zero.
Simply put, stuff
happens. Now embrace it and move
on to what

48:51.729 --> 48:53.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you can control.

48:53.531 --> 48:57.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a responsible parent, you
purchase that
car seat. You buy a bike helmet,
talk to your

48:57.268 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids about texting and driving.
You minimize
their risks and maximize their
defenses. And

49:03.274 --> 49:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet, somehow, terror seems
different, so random,
uncontrollable.

49:08.245 --> 49:12.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That distinction is of our own
making. If
something catastrophic were to
happen, there

49:12.550 --> 49:17.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is comfort in knowing that basic
precautions
can go far to give you grip and
control in

49:17.254 --> 49:19.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the aftermath.

49:19.056 --> 49:22.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The general rule of thumb is
that every home
should be prepared for basic
needs for three

49:22.560 --> 49:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days without outside help. In
the field, it's
called 72 on you.

49:27.431 --> 49:32.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first, go to your convenient
supermarket
and get the following: water,
cereal, nuts,

49:32.403 --> 49:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protein bars, a flashlight,
batteries, and
a first-aid kit. That's it,
seriously. There

49:38.175 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is always more you could get to
make life
better. We have added vodka and
Diet Coke

49:42.279 --> 49:45.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Red Vines to our stash,
given my family's
bad habits.

49:45.316 --> 49:52.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But don't let the perfect be
enemy of the
prepared. Then make copies of
essential papers.

49:52.223 --> 49:55.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mail them out of state or save a
photo of
them to the cloud.

49:55.659 --> 50:00.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, have a conversation at
home about
what to do if family members are
in different

50:00.331 --> 50:05.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places. In a crisis, all you
will care about
is family unification. Talk
through strategies

50:05.803 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if cell service is down. Map out
alternative
plans.

50:09.340 --> 50:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Addressing these risks isn't
going to shock
your older kids. They already
saw it all on

50:14.745 --> 50:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter. Manage your and their
fears by preparing
for when the bad thing might
happen.

50:19.750 --> 50:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As parents, the more we can
maximize our own
readiness, the less we will feel
that we have

50:24.221 --> 50:27.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no grip over the mayhem that
exists out there.

50:27.992 --> 50:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professionally and personally, I
would like
nothing more than to be able to
answer the

50:31.528 --> 50:38.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question is ISIS in New York
City with an
absolute no. But, failing that,
why not have

50:38.636 --> 50:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a backup plan? Own it. Then move
on.

50:45.242 --> 50:57.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
