JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.708 --> 00:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
race for the
White House officially shifts
gears to the

00:11.411 --> 00:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general election, with both
tickets set and
both conventions behind us.

00:16.149 --> 00:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: digging up London's
history, while reshaping
the iconic city's look for the
future.

HEATHER KNIGHT, Archaeologist:
If we were
standing here on, say, a lovely
summer's afternoon

00:26.793 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 1590s, we'd actually be
standing on
the stage of the Curtain
Playhouse.

00:29.029 --> 00:36.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mark Shields
and David
Brooks consider the biggest
convention moments,

00:36.303 --> 00:39.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and look at the campaign that
lies ahead.

00:39.172 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.879 --> 00:48.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:48.615 --> 00:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With their
national conventions
in the rear-view mirror, the
presidential

00:57.557 --> 01:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates head out on the road
to target
states that could go either way,
and help

01:02.596 --> 01:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
determine the election outcome.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:07.734 --> 01:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The newly
minted Democratic
ticket made its first
post-convention campaign

01:12.572 --> 01:16.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stop at Temple University, just
minutes from
last night's political party.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
What better place to kick off
this campaign

01:20.714 --> 01:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than right here in Philadelphia?

01:22.649 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For three days,
the maiden
bus tour will wind through the
Rust Belt battlegrounds

01:27.254 --> 01:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Pennsylvania and Ohio.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton will be joined by her
husband, Bill,
as well as running mate, Tim
Kaine, and his

01:33.860 --> 01:35.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wife, Anne.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I can't
think of an
election that is more important
certainly

01:39.933 --> 01:46.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my lifetime, and it's not so
much that
I'm on the ticket.

01:46.773 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is because of the stark
choice that is
posed to America in this
election.

01:53.146 --> 01:56.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today was about
November.

01:56.950 --> 02:01.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night was about history, as
Clinton became
the first woman to accept a
major party's

02:01.989 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential nomination.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many of her supporters, it
was an emotional
night.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: It's a trailblazer moment
for me.

02:08.528 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It kind of tells me that I can
be anything
that I want to be when I grow
up, with some

02:13.433 --> 02:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hard work and dedication.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Countering that
narrative
was Republican Donald Trump, who
launched

02:18.472 --> 02:24.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a barrage of tweets this
morning, including:
"Crooked Hillary Clinton
mentioned me 22 times

02:24.711 --> 02:27.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in her very long and very boring
speech.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many of her statements were lies
and fabrications."

02:30.684 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later this afternoon, Trump
spoke at a campaign
rally in Colorado springs.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I watched last night.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I watched Hillary Clinton.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:40.327 --> 02:44.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What a sad, what a
sad situation.

02:44.064 --> 02:50.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I watched her last night
giving a speech
that was so average.

02:50.637 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On this first
official day
of the general election fight,
there are new

02:54.341 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerns today over political
cyber-security.

02:56.610 --> 03:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reuters reported today that the
computer network
used by the Clinton campaign was
hacked.

03:02.249 --> 03:06.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, the Democratic
Congressional Campaign
Committee, a group focused on
the House of

03:06.119 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Representatives, said its
computers have been
hacked.

03:09.289 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI is investigating and
said the breaches
resemble an earlier cyber-attack
on the Democratic

03:14.928 --> 03:16.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Committee.

03:16.997 --> 03:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That intrusion revealed e-mails
in which party
officials privately berated
Clinton's primary

03:22.269 --> 03:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opponent, Bernie Sanders.

03:24.337 --> 03:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's team has said the hack
reveals a
problem with Trump and his
relationship with

03:28.708 --> 03:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia, who intelligence experts
suspect of
being responsible.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump himself denies
involvement.

03:35.215 --> 03:40.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did publicly ask Russia to
find e-mails
missing from Clinton's private
e-mail server,

03:40.420 --> 03:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he insists those remarks
were sarcastic.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview on CNN this
morning, Clinton's
running mate called the remarks
ignorant.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
And when Donald Trump is
basically trying

03:51.398 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to encourage them to do it with
respect to
the U.S. election, I think an
awful lot of

03:54.901 --> 03:59.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people will see that and say
that that is
temperamentally disqualification
for the office.

03:59.873 --> 04:04.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a first
volley in a
campaign where national security
promises

04:04.611 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to loom large.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:08.281 --> 04:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the campaign
trail to
a major legal decision in a
swing state.

04:13.553 --> 04:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appeals court today
struck down
a North Carolina law requiring
voters to show

04:18.859 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain forms of identification
at the polls.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It determined the legislation
was passed with
-- quote -- "racially
discriminatory intent."

04:26.867 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
today's decision,
and its effect, right after this
news summary.

04:32.873 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
governor of Florida
said that his state likely has
the first local

04:37.944 --> 04:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zika outbreak in the continental
U.S. Mosquitoes
are transmitting the virus in
two Miami-area

04:44.885 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counties.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

04:55.495 --> 04:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: Now
that Florida
has become the first state to
have a local

04:57.464 --> 05:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transmission, likely through a
mosquito, we
will continue to put every
resource available

05:01.835 --> 05:05.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fighting the spread of Zika
in our state.

05:05.572 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If it becomes clear more
resources are need,
we will not hesitate.

05:09.809 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over 1,650 Zika
infections
have been reported across the
U.S., but, up

05:16.016 --> 05:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until now, they have been linked
to travel
outside the U.S. mainland.

05:20.854 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six more state officials in
Michigan have
been charged with misconduct and
neglect in

05:25.659 --> 05:27.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Flint's water crisis.

05:27.994 --> 05:32.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators found employees in
the state's
health and environmental
departments hid or

05:32.165 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
manipulated evidence of
dangerous lead levels
in the city's tap water.

05:37.771 --> 05:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan's attorney general
announced the
new charges today at a news
conference in

05:42.309 --> 05:44.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flint.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL SCHUETTE, Michigan Attorney
General:
Each of these individuals
attempted to bury

05:46.379 --> 05:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or cover up, to downplay or to
hide information
that contradicted their own
narrative, their

05:53.486 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

05:55.689 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their narrative and their
story was, there's
nothing wrong with Flint water,
and it was

06:02.462 --> 06:04.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
perfectly safe to use.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In essence, these individuals
concealed the
truth.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were criminally wrong to do
so.

06:10.604 --> 06:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nine Michigan
public officials
are now facing prosecution for
their roles

06:15.742 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the tainted water crisis.

06:17.811 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, investigators insisted
they're -- quote

maternity
hospital supported by the

Children.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was located in an
opposition-held area
in Idlib province.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least two people were killed.

06:34.928 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The bombing followed an

coalition airstrike that killed
28 civilians

06:40.900 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

hundreds of people

06:50.176 --> 06:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

solidarity with Turkey

06:59.319 --> 07:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the wake of a failed military
coup earlier
this month.

07:03.223 --> 07:08.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pentagon officials denied that

The pontiff spent much of his
pilgrimage in
quiet contemplation, honoring
the more than

07:38.091 --> 07:41.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a million victims who died there
during the
Holocaust.

07:41.728 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He also met with several
survivors and Christian
Poles who rescued Jews.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His only public comment was a
message written
in the site's guest book, saying
-- quote

07:51.738 --> 07:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "Lord, forgive so much
cruelty."

07:55.575 --> 08:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

The Nasdaq rose more than 1
percent.

08:18.765 --> 08:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
North Carolina's

from the Republican and
Democratic Conventions;
and much more.

08:38.051 --> 08:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: another major ruling about
voting laws
that could impact the upcoming
election.

08:48.461 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appeals court today
struck down
several of North Carolina's
voting rules,

08:53.767 --> 08:58.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ruling that they were
intentionally designed
to discriminate against black
voters.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the latest.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Before we get
to the ruling,
a bit of background.

09:03.276 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Three years ago, the
GOP-controlled legislature
in North Carolina changed the
voting rules

09:07.514 --> 09:09.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in their state.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They passed stricter voter I.D.
requirements,
and cut back on things like
early voting and

09:13.019 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
same-day voter registration.

09:14.954 --> 09:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those were reforms Democrats had
put in place
years before.

09:18.158 --> 09:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But today's ruling by the Fourth
Circuit Court
of Appeals said that those
changes discriminated

09:22.629 --> 09:24.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against black voters.

09:24.497 --> 09:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court said -- quote -- "The
new provisions
target African-Americans with
almost surgical

09:29.169 --> 09:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
precision," and that these
voting rules impose
cures for problems that didn't
exist.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to wade through
all the implications
of all this is Kareem Crayton.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a visiting professor of
law at Vanderbilt
University.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Professor Crayton, thank you.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very sweeping ruling
by the court
today.

09:46.820 --> 09:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court basically argued that
the state
of North Carolina intentionally
discriminated

09:51.691 --> 09:52.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against voters.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's a pretty rare
finding, isn't
it?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON, Voting Rights
Scholar, Vanderbilt
University: That's true.

09:56.830 --> 10:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the modern era, most of these
cases get
litigated under a concern about
the effects

10:01.668 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the law, whether they were
disproportionately
affecting one group or the
other.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one where the court went
so far as
to say that the purposes for
which this law

10:09.742 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was adopted were those that
prohibited -- were
prohibited by law, that they
were racially

10:14.214 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discriminatory and targeting
African-Americans
in a way that the law doesn't
permit.

10:17.917 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What was it
specifically
that the court found so
troubling?

10:21.421 --> 10:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON: Well, there were
a number
of circumstances under which
this law was

10:26.426 --> 10:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adopted that raised some serious
suspicions.

10:29.496 --> 10:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, there was the adoption of
the law on
the heels of a United States
Supreme Court

10:35.068 --> 10:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ruling, Shelby County vs.
Holder, which had
a number of protections against
any discrimination

10:39.839 --> 10:44.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or to allow for any
discrimination protections
for African-Americans, and North
Carolina

10:44.043 --> 10:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly rushed through this
statute.

10:46.079 --> 10:52.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition to that, the
legislature had information
in front of it identifying those
avenues for

10:52.051 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
participation that
African-Americans
disproportionately
tended to take advantage of.

10:56.322 --> 11:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at the kinds
of things that
the new law prescribed or
restricted, they

11:01.394 --> 11:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really cleverly matched up with
those areas,
those avenues that
African-Americans used

11:05.899 --> 11:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more often than not.

11:07.834 --> 11:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the selectivity, of
these restrictions
ultimately raised the specter of
discriminatory

11:13.907 --> 11:15.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
intent.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, taking all of that into
account, in addition
to the fact, of course, that
North Carolina

11:17.610 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a pretty long history of
discrimination
with respect to race, and the
court found

11:23.082 --> 11:28.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more recent evidence of
discrimination in
the redistricting cases, this
court was willing

11:28.154 --> 11:34.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say that there was a pretty
strong claim
that the purposes for this
statute were some

11:34.394 --> 11:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the same considerations that
were behind
the 14th Amendment's prohibition
of assuring

11:40.500 --> 11:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that states shouldn't take race
into account
in creating new laws.

11:43.503 --> 11:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And supporters
in North
Carolina of these laws say this
had nothing

11:48.174 --> 11:49.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do with racial
discrimination.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were trying to target, they
said, voter
fraud.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You lived in North Carolina and
taught there
for a while.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was voter fraud a problem in
North Carolina?

11:58.451 --> 12:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON: Well, the
problem with that
argument is that -- I tend to do
work based

12:03.523 --> 12:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on evidence and data -- and
there was no data
available to the legislature
showing that

12:07.694 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voter fraud was that kind of
consideration
that was actually meriting some
sort of regulation,

12:14.867 --> 12:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or they hadn't uncovered any
evidence that
voter fraud was a problem to be
solved.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To the extent that there was
voter fraud,
it sounds like many -- there is
actually some

12:24.043 --> 12:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence that members of the
legislature had
engaged in voter fraud.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And none of that in some ways
was regulated.

12:29.716 --> 12:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stuff that they seemed to be
going after
was sort of the specter, the
illusion of voter

12:35.421 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraud, as opposed to the actual
evidence of
voter fraud.

12:38.691 --> 12:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's also another factor
that sort of
influenced the court's analysis
in this case.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: North Carolina
obviously
isn't the only state around the
nation that

12:45.732 --> 12:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is currently changing their
voting laws.

12:48.434 --> 12:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think we're seeing
such an uptick
in this sudden reformation of
voting laws

12:53.139 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nationwide?

12:55.174 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON: Well, I think
one of the considerations
is that a lot of the
legislatures after 2010

13:00.713 --> 13:02.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
changed hands.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans were very
effective at winning
a lot of races in an off-year
election, when

13:05.985 --> 13:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turnout tends to be lower.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In cases like North Carolina,
which is understood
to be a purple state -- you
probably will

13:12.258 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be covering this a lot in the
upcoming presidential
election -- the legislature
recognizes that

13:16.896 --> 13:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many -- excuse me, statewide
contests,
every vote tends to make a
difference.

13:21.701 --> 13:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, from their perspective,
I think, from
a partisan perspective, the
court even recognized

13:26.472 --> 13:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there might be some advantage to
be had by
Republicans limiting populations
that tend

13:30.677 --> 13:32.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote for Democrats.

13:32.412 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the court in this case
said was,
even if that's present, it
doesn't forgive

13:36.549 --> 13:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the targeting of people based
upon race.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the offensive part
under the
analysis of the Voting Rights
Act and the

13:42.188 --> 13:43.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Constitution.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
practically speaking,
if I'm a voter in North Carolina
and I go

13:46.259 --> 13:49.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cast my ballot in this next
election, what
does this really mean?

13:49.228 --> 13:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does this -- how does this
change anything?

13:51.731 --> 13:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON: Well, the court
was very clear
that this decision should have
immediate effect.

13:57.837 --> 14:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, while procedurally
sometimes you can
seek additional review, in this
case, the

14:03.443 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that the court had seen
such rampant
evidence of intent to
discriminate, they made

14:08.681 --> 14:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that this was going to be
the law that
would apply for the upcoming
election.

14:12.752 --> 14:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're a voter in North
Carolina, the
law is now that you can proceed
to cast ballots

14:18.057 --> 14:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without the restrictions that
the legislature
put on the ballot -- excuse me
-- put on the

14:21.594 --> 14:24.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
books in 2013.

14:24.130 --> 14:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if the court in D.C., the
Supreme Court,
were asked to review this case,
the time that

14:29.602 --> 14:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would take to get through
that analysis
wouldn't be quick enough in
order to apply

14:33.573 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this claim in most cases.

14:35.775 --> 14:40.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think voters can
confidently proceed
under the view that they won't
have the same

14:40.880 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of restrictions that were
present in
2013 and 2014 because of the
statute.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Kareem Crayton,
Vanderbilt University School of
Law, thank

14:49.355 --> 14:50.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

14:50.356 --> 14:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM CRAYTON: Thank you.

14:55.962 --> 15:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
hacking of
the Democratic National
Committee.

15:08.941 --> 15:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to reports, U.S.
intelligence has
high confidence the Russian
government was

15:13.746 --> 15:15.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind it.

15:15.648 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sources close to the
investigation told the
"NewsHour" one of the hackers
was also involved

15:19.986 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the breach of the Democratic
Congressional
Campaign Committee, and then
today's revelations

15:25.558 --> 15:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton's campaign
was also hacked.

15:28.961 --> 15:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We explore how the U.S.
government should
respond now with Susan
Hennessey.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was an attorney in the
Office of the General
Counsel of the National Security
Agency.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is now a fellow at the
Brookings Institution.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Andrew Weiss, he has worked
for both Republican
and Democratic administrations
as a staffer

15:46.746 --> 15:50.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on the National Security
Council, in the State
and Defense Departments.

15:50.683 --> 15:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now at the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

15:56.756 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Hennessey, let me start
with you.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before I even ask you about the
hacking of
the Clinton campaign itself,
which we just

16:02.728 --> 16:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learned about this afternoon,
how confident
are you that it was the Russian
government

16:08.401 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was behind the hacking into
the DNC and
the Congressional Campaign
Committee?

16:15.942 --> 16:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY, Brookings
Institution: All
right, so when attributing
cyber-attacks,

16:18.644 --> 16:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's almost impossible to ever
be 100 percent
certain.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, you are about as
certain as
you could reasonably expect to
be.

16:25.351 --> 16:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were strong technical
indicators that
emerged as early as June.

16:29.889 --> 16:34.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now I'm hearing that the
intelligence community
has reported to the president
high confidence.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a likely indicator that
they have found
corroborating evidence through
other intelligence

16:39.031 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mechanisms, signals
intelligence, financial
intelligence, human intelligence

16:42.168 --> 16:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, at this point, it's a fair
operating assumption.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There might be some room for
plausible deniability,
but it's really quite certain.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, I just
want to say,
we're having a little difficulty
with your

16:52.778 --> 16:53.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
microphone.

16:53.779 --> 16:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to trying to get
that fixed.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to turn right now to
Andrew Weiss.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about you?

16:57.817 --> 17:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much confidence do you have
that it's
clearly the Russian government
behind what

17:03.222 --> 17:05.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we know so far?

17:05.157 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS, Carnegie Endowment
for International
Peace: Well, so far, this is a
very fast-moving

17:06.626 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

17:08.427 --> 17:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we all need to be
cautious, because
the facts are not clearly out
there.

17:10.563 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, General Clapper, who
is the president's
director of national
intelligence, was talking

17:14.967 --> 17:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Aspen, and he said he wasn't
prepared at
this stage to make a call.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But so far, everything that has
dribbled out
seems to point in the direction
of some form

17:21.507 --> 17:23.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Russian government
involvement.

17:23.409 --> 17:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been forensic data that
has been trumped
out -- dribbled into the press
that points

17:28.080 --> 17:32.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to comparable attacks that have
been attributed
to Russia over the past several
months.

17:32.652 --> 17:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the attacks on the DNC and
the DCCC seem
to be fitting within the same
group of Russian

17:38.124 --> 17:39.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actors.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Andrew
Weiss, staying
with you, now that we're seeing
this report

17:41.761 --> 17:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just in -- late this afternoon
that the Clinton
campaign itself has been hacked,
what does

17:47.934 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that tell you?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, about a
month or so ago,
General Clapper himself also
pointed to the

17:52.505 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
possibility that foreign
governments were
trying to hack into the U.S.
presidential

17:56.943 --> 17:58.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign staffs.

17:58.811 --> 18:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the word has been on the
street for
a while now that this is a very
toxic environment,

18:03.749 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that there is a lot of
interest in what
traditionally people would think
is confidential

18:07.787 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or secret.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Hennessey,
why would
the Russians do this?

18:11.223 --> 18:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there is a lot of
suspicion going
around maybe they want to tilt
the election

18:14.460 --> 18:15.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one way or another.

18:15.861 --> 18:19.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is believed by the people
who study these
issues all the time?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Well, so there
is a lot of
different explanations.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that there are -- there's
reasons why
a President Trump would be more
favorable

18:25.304 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Russian interests.

18:27.073 --> 18:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's indicated positions, being
withdrawing
support from NATO, for example,
which is a

18:31.978 --> 18:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary check on Russian global
power in the
world.

18:35.581 --> 18:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Additionally, the Russians have
a history
with Hillary Clinton, and
Vladimir Putin in

18:39.452 --> 18:40.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particular.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they also have a reason to
oppose her.

18:42.822 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also have a reason to maybe
just demonstrate
that the U.S. has some
corruption in its elections

18:47.226 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of its own.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Andrew
Weiss, what's your
sense of what motivations there
could be behind

18:52.999 --> 18:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the Russians are doing?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, let's step
back a little
bit.

18:56.235 --> 19:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you remember, the past three
years have
been a real down point in
U.S.-Russia relations.

19:00.339 --> 19:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a result of the severe
deterioration
in U.S.-Russia relations, the
Kremlin has

19:04.877 --> 19:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorized any number of lines
of effort.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we have seen cyber-attacks in
Europe.

19:09.081 --> 19:13.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen support for
populist parties,
including Marine Le Pen in
France, financial

19:13.552 --> 19:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
support, political support.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen cyber-intrusions
against U.S.
allies.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen overt military
intimidation.

19:20.326 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have Russian jets trying to
barrel-roll
U.S. military planes over the
Baltics.

19:24.930 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overall process of Russia
putting pressure
on the United States is
well-established.

19:29.969 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question now is, why were
these facts
from the DNC leaked publicly?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was the goal?

19:35.241 --> 19:36.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What was the political
motivation?

19:37.009 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems in part to be -- to
create as
much confusion and to create as
big as mess

19:40.880 --> 19:42.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

19:42.615 --> 19:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To say that an attack that was
going back
12 months, when the first
detection was of

19:47.386 --> 19:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian presence inside the
DNC's e-mail servers
to today, it's been a very
complicated election

19:52.091 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's hard to say the
Russians tactically
knew exactly what they were
doing.

19:56.095 --> 20:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that gets to
-- Susan Hennessey,
that gets to this question of
whether the

20:02.601 --> 20:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian government gave it to
WikiLeaks to
put all of it out there or
whether it was

20:06.038 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stolen and that things just got
out of hand.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Right.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one thing that's interesting
is actually
the initial leaks from the
documents were

20:12.545 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not leaked through WikiLeaks.

20:14.346 --> 20:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were actually posted on a
stand-alone
site by a hacker reporting to
the Guccifer

20:19.685 --> 20:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2.0, it was only this latest
e-mail dump that
actually went through WikiLeaks.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are reasons to believe the
Russians
might have handed it over, but
there are alternative

20:28.961 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explanations.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean
reasons to
believe the Russians might have
handed it

20:32.465 --> 20:33.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over?

20:33.699 --> 20:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mean because of what we have
been talking
about here?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Right.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's no evidence that a
third party
breached the DNC or the DCCC.

20:40.005 --> 20:43.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's sort of a logical
inference that
the documents were in one place.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one else has them, and they
wind up in
another.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, it's possible the
documents were
stolen from the Russians
themselves or were

20:51.984 --> 20:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stolen from the DNC by some
third party.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What should the
U.S. -- what
are the options, let me put it
that way, Andrew

20:57.590 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Weiss, for the U.S. government
in response
to this?

20:59.859 --> 21:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: FBI Director James
Comey came
out recently in the last 24
hours and said

21:05.030 --> 21:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's looking at the possibility
of naming
the culprit.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this has been something
that the U.S.
government has done very seldom
in the past,

21:12.271 --> 21:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they basically try to name
and shame
and say that we can attribute
this attack

21:15.908 --> 21:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a state actor, in this
particularly case
potentially Russia.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been done very seldom in
the past with
regards to China and North
Korea.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be a very big step, if
that's where
the U.S. government ends up.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that the
strongest step
the United States could take?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Certainly not.

21:30.256 --> 21:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's sort of -- that's the
preliminary step,
kind of the most basic step they
could take.

21:34.994 --> 21:39.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The additional levels of
attribution might
be to the actual individuals
behind these

21:39.398 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks who are operating
perhaps in the Russian
state.

21:42.001 --> 21:47.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so in the past, the
Department of Justice
has indicted Iranian
cyber-hackers, Chinese

21:47.606 --> 21:48.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cyber-hackers.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So those kinds of indictments
would be sort
of an escalation.

21:52.044 --> 21:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But really there is the full
scope of options
in terms of how to respond.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Naming
individuals who are
part of the Russian government?

21:58.350 --> 22:00.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Sure.

22:00.319 --> 22:05.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, imposing financial sanctions
against individuals
who are suspected or believed of
being involved.

22:05.357 --> 22:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also a benefit and an
embarrassment
to just saying that we know who
it is and

22:11.864 --> 22:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of putting that out into
the public space.

22:13.632 --> 22:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Andrew Weiss,
what are the
-- I guess the possible
repercussions if the

22:18.971 --> 22:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. does not only name and
shame, but go
even further?

22:22.675 --> 22:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: I think we're in a
real moment
of uncertainty.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People think about what's going
to happen
in this election campaign.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to think about, where
will U.S.-Russia
relations be in three or four
months?

22:33.652 --> 22:35.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I frankly have no idea.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, are we in a
spiral, or are
we in a possible moment where
there could

22:38.857 --> 22:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a worse confrontation at some
point, military-to-military,
an inadvertent escalatory
moment?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's a very dangerous
situation.

22:45.798 --> 22:50.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's really important
for the U.S.
policy community to take a deep
breath and

22:50.202 --> 22:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evaluate our situation very
carefully before
rushing into anything.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's clear
this is a
story that, just as the days
have gone by,

22:57.009 --> 22:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have learned more, and today
this new information
about the Clinton campaign.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we will see what more comes
out.

23:02.014 --> 23:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Andrew Weiss, Susan Hennessey,
thank you both.

23:07.519 --> 23:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Thanks for
having us.

23:14.593 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW WEISS: Thank you.

23:19.298 --> 23:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
-- stay with
us.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze this
week at the

23:31.610 --> 23:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic National Convention;
and a building

America's promise,

JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that, we
turn to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

28:45.457 --> 28:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

28:49.461 --> 28:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, gentlemen, looking back on
those highlights
from both Cleveland and
Philadelphia, what

28:53.932 --> 28:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does it make you think, Mark?

28:55.567 --> 29:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It makes me think
that the Democrats
-- this was my 24th convention.

29:01.940 --> 29:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this was as good a
Democratic
Convention as I have seen since
the 1976 convention,

29:08.180 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which nominated Jimmy Carter,
which was -- he
left with a 30-point lead over
President Ford.

29:13.352 --> 29:17.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I just thought it was a
spectacularly successful
convention.

29:17.089 --> 29:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think Hillary Clinton's
speech was
spectacular, but I don't think
she's a spectacular

29:22.094 --> 29:23.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speaker.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I thought their messages
worked.

29:25.430 --> 29:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly the national
security and preempting
both faith and country and
patriotism from

29:34.139 --> 29:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republicans, which had been
the Republican
symbols for so long, was
effective.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David?

29:39.478 --> 29:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the Democrats had the
better convention
by a long way.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's rare we see the gap so big,
frankly.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They controlled the debate.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump tried to set up
this debate where
it was going to be globalists
vs. nationalists,

29:50.989 --> 29:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Republicans were going
to be the nationalists.

29:52.758 --> 29:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if anything, the Democrats
looked more
patriotic and more nationalist
at the end

29:56.395 --> 29:57.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these two.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that was a big win.

29:59.898 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I agree with Mark.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole presentation was just
powerful.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's funny.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe it just because I'm tired,
but the further
away you get, the less you know
about the

30:08.473 --> 30:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convention, and it boils down to
a core theme,
to one thing.

30:12.544 --> 30:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for the Republican
Convention, I think
of Trump's speech and sort of
the darkness,

30:17.683 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fear of crime, the need for
a strong arm
really, and so that one core
theme.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, for the Democratic
one, I really
think of Trump erratic.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was the big message
that came
out.

30:29.861 --> 30:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The positive agenda for Hillary
was a little
less vibrant.

30:33.398 --> 30:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of those two, I do think
that the -- right
now, at least in my mind, the
Democratic theme

30:38.870 --> 30:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is eclipsing the Republican one.

30:40.872 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the Democrats won this
volley, I think.

30:43.809 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, we're
hearing today
that the numbers of people
watching the conventions

30:48.714 --> 30:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a little bit higher for the
Republican
Convention.

30:51.817 --> 30:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do these conventions
set the stage
for the rest of this campaign?

30:55.887 --> 31:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's, what, 101 days
between now and
the Election Day.

31:00.358 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, if David and
I are right,
which is...

31:04.329 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ninety-nine
percent of the
time.

31:06.832 --> 31:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... a very long
shot, then Hillary
Clinton should get a bounce out
of this convention,

31:10.502 --> 31:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean a bounce in the polls.

31:12.437 --> 31:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's probably conceded
that Donald
Trump got about a three-point
bounce out of

31:16.575 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his conventions.

31:17.909 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's closed the gap that much.

31:20.545 --> 31:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if she doesn't, I mean,
after what was
a good convention -- this is
when you have

31:24.983 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the unfiltered message of your
party and your
candidate to the country, even a
slice of

31:30.689 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country, for four full days
-- then I
think it's some cause for alarm
for the Democrats.

31:37.262 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, I think what
we're looking
at next, Judy, is the debates.

31:42.834 --> 31:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, barring something
major, a mishap
on one side or a tragedy or a
scandal, I think,

31:50.308 --> 31:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, we're looking at the
debates, because
I think that's the kind of race
it's going

31:54.146 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they don't
start, David,
until the end of September and
then into October.

31:58.717 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, do these conventions, do
they define this
race going forward?

32:04.289 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think to some
degree.

32:06.324 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now it's my turn to rain on
progressive
overconfidence, because the two
weakest speeches,

32:13.765 --> 32:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major ones, for the Democrats
were the two
candidates, not that they were
bad.

32:17.669 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just weren't up to the
level of Biden's,
the Obamas, and Bloomberg's
even.

32:23.275 --> 32:27.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so you have got two
candidates on the
Democratic side who may be
making sense, may

32:28.013 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agree or disagree.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're just not as vibrant
personalities
as Donald Trump.

32:32.450 --> 32:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, over the next month,
until the debates,
I expect Trump to do what he's
done very successfully,

32:38.123 --> 32:40.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, whether you like him
or not, he
will be the dominant player
here.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He will be the one on offense.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will be the one serving
volleys, and it
may be some weird stuff about
the Russians,

32:46.565 --> 32:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he will be controlling
things a little
more than he probably did over
the last two

32:50.101 --> 32:51.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

32:51.536 --> 32:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that now
the way elections
get decided, Mark?

32:54.606 --> 32:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, let me just
dissent a
little bit from David.

32:58.210 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Donald Trump is
obviously the more
colorful, the more flamboyant,
the more dominant

33:04.249 --> 33:05.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personality.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But take the Russia issue.

33:07.052 --> 33:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You open up the convention, and
you have got
a report that the Democratic
Party has been

33:10.722 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hacked by the Russians, e-mails,
the e-mails
of the Democratic Party, which
is a headline

33:16.328 --> 33:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and words that you don't want,
if you're Hillary
Clinton's campaign.

33:19.931 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump immediately
takes the story
and basically steps on the
advantage he has

33:26.404 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say, well, the Russians, who
am I to tell
Putin?

33:28.773 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the Russians ought to
come in and
continue to hack our -- and find
out where

33:34.246 --> 33:36.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the e-mails are.

33:36.147 --> 33:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it was -- it was wrong,
it was irresponsible,
and it was unhelpful to his
candidacy.

33:41.253 --> 33:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a strange way -- there are a
couple thoughts
of David that reminded me of
this -- an awful

33:48.193 --> 33:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of people don't ordinarily
have day-to-day
contact with police officers.

33:53.098 --> 33:58.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In both Cleveland and
Philadelphia, the police
were enormously, enormously
impressive, I

33:58.637 --> 34:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean, their temperament, to use
a word that's
going to be central...

34:01.773 --> 34:02.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:03.008 --> 34:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't mean
the police on
the stage.

34:04.142 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mean the police in the
street.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I mean the
police in the
streets.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I really -- the
interaction with the
police.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They had to be tired.

34:10.382 --> 34:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, they had a lot of
jerks, including
several in the press.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it was hot.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was hot.

34:18.590 --> 34:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they had long hours, and
they were just
so professional and so cool.

34:24.329 --> 34:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it strikes me that it's the
competing
pronouns that the Democrats did
effectively,

34:29.000 --> 34:30.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I vs. we.

34:30.535 --> 34:32.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's we the people.

34:32.971 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump says nobody
knows it like
me, I can do it.

34:37.108 --> 34:43.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that was a very
effective construct
in framing this race.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to pick up on the cops, we
don't really
-- I hadn't really thought about
it, but we

34:46.651 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all agree they did such a good
job by not
being overaggressive.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But for Donald
Trump -- just
the political effects of that,
Donald Trump's

34:53.124 --> 34:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument is essentially it's
1968, the cities
are burning.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if something really bad had
happened in
one of those two cities, that
would have underlined

35:00.832 --> 35:01.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that theme.

35:01.833 --> 35:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And nothing bad
happened.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so -- but that doesn't mean
we're not
-- it's settled.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Events are in the saddle here.

35:09.174 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If ISIS really begins a sort of
continual
series of weird, random attacks
around the

35:14.612 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world, then that does underline
the theme.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that goes back to something
I have been
saying for the last couple of
weeks, is, we're

35:19.818 --> 35:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not quite sure what ball game
we're playing
here.

35:22.687 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're playing the normal
political rules,
where you want to have people
loving each

35:27.125 --> 35:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other, compassionate, working
together, being
generous toward each other,
being well-informed

35:32.097 --> 35:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the issues, well, if those
are the rules,
then the Democrats are doing
really well.

35:36.401 --> 35:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we're in some sort of
Hobbesian state
of nature, where you just want a
strong man

35:41.139 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has no compassion, who you
just want a
toughness, well, then that -- by
those rules,

35:46.978 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is going to do a
little better.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we will figure out what game
we're playing.

35:50.181 --> 35:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is what the
Democrats
were trying to say for three or
four days

35:53.485 --> 35:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- for four days, Mark, which,
is, we don't
need this.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're a strong people.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're a good people and we don't
need some
bully telling us what to do.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, exactly.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the president did that, I
thought.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Obama did.

36:04.829 --> 36:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a strange way, Hillary
Clinton was helped
and victimized by Mr. and Mrs.
Obama.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Michelle Obama gave a
speech...

36:11.703 --> 36:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Victimized?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Really?

36:14.539 --> 36:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, politically,
because they
were just -- you were talking
about -- I mean,

36:17.776 --> 36:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michelle Obama was probably
better than Barack
Obama, if you think about it.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her speech is a masterful,
masterful speech.

36:24.315 --> 36:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she delivered it in a
persuasively conversational
tone.

36:29.354 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't say this is a
political attack or
a political document.

36:34.359 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just -- so, in a strange
way, she's
getting compared to -- instead
of to Donald

36:40.265 --> 36:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, she's being compared to
Joe Biden,
who gave this emotional
valedictory about

36:45.870 --> 36:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America and his life, and both
Obamas, who
were dominant.

36:51.409 --> 36:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim Kaine reminds me of -- Peter
Hart, the
pollster, has a question when he
asks about

36:55.980 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
presidential or vice
presidential candidates,
what kind of a neighbor would
they be?

37:00.185 --> 37:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And several Democrats -- George
W. Bush was
always seen to be a good
friendly neighbor

37:04.189 --> 37:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who would pick up the newspapers
if you were
out of town or check your mail.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tim Kaine is a good neighbor.

37:10.762 --> 37:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's kind of the dependable, you
know, friendly,
helpful.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, he would be over
there.

37:17.902 --> 37:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would give you a hand if
there were a problem
at the house.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does that
help Hillary
Clinton?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:25.510 --> 37:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It does, because
it gives Hillary
Clinton -- what they didn't
address at this

37:28.146 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convention is Hillary Clinton's
problems of
her personality and her secrecy.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They tried through testimony.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She just can't open up herself.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She can't make fun of herself.

37:39.757 --> 37:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She can't be self-deprecating,
or at least,
if she can, she wasn't, made the
decision

37:43.461 --> 37:44.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not to be.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Tim Kaine kind of gives
the warmer,
human face of the Democrats.

37:48.633 --> 37:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But if she's
elected, this will
be an issue and this will be a
problem for

37:52.103 --> 37:53.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important for presidents to
emotionally
connect, with the country in
times of crisis,

37:56.841 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but also with people in
Washington.

37:58.943 --> 38:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you can't emotionally connect
-- and Obama
is not the greatest, but he can
at least do

38:03.381 --> 38:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it -- then people won't be with
you when the
times are hard.

38:06.885 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will just always be a
distance between
you and the people around you.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, she can clearly emotionally
connect with
her intimates within the zone of
trust.

38:14.792 --> 38:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just the wall outside the
zone of trust
is so impermeable.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I do think -- I was
really struck,
like every pundit, from Mark and
I on down...

38:23.234 --> 38:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, on down,
for sure.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:26.337 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You guys are
right up there.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Everyone is
saying, show some
vulnerability, emote, emote,
emote.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And they must have
said that
internally.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's still -- she's such a
private person.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She just didn't do it.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it almost
sounds like you're
both saying -- I don't want to
use the word

38:41.886 --> 38:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doomed, but that the cake is
baked, and she's
not going to be able to relate
and open up.

38:47.859 --> 38:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, but Donald Trump is
relating...

38:51.062 --> 38:52.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:52.297 --> 38:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: This was a great
opportunity
to open up.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was on her terms.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was nonadversarial.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was in her control.

38:57.535 --> 38:58.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she chose not to.

38:58.903 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do disagree just with David on
her vs. Obama
inside in dealing.

39:06.177 --> 39:12.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think she would be far
superior to President
Obama, who is basically remote,
aloof and

39:12.483 --> 39:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not involved with -- he doesn't
deal with
members of Congress.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he plays golf every time
with three staff
members.

39:18.723 --> 39:23.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He never, ever thinks of
including a John
Boehner or anybody else, which
is very easy

39:23.861 --> 39:25.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

39:25.163 --> 39:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he obviously views golf as
his time, and
that alone.

39:28.633 --> 39:34.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she showed, while in the
Senate, that
ability to connect and reach
across and to

39:34.105 --> 39:35.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forge alliances.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think she will be better.

39:36.941 --> 39:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the problem with
connecting emotionally
with the people remains at large
is -- in

39:40.778 --> 39:41.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a wholesale way.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I stand corrected.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That seems true to me, what he
just said.

39:45.149 --> 39:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But then you're
getting back
-- and we just have a minute or
so -- but

39:48.019 --> 39:53.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're getting to the point that
somebody
who is good at governing may not
be great

39:53.191 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at campaigning.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And the inverse,
too.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are people who are great
campaigners
who aren't...

39:58.863 --> 39:59.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we can certainly point to
examples of
that.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mitch Daniels, the
former governor
of Indiana was a case of that,
who was an

40:04.669 --> 40:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outstanding administrator.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

40:06.671 --> 40:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He was not a bad
governor.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could be playful, but -- or
communicator.

40:09.507 --> 40:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just saying it will -- I
think will be
-- every candidate comes into
the White House,

40:13.144 --> 40:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assuming if she wins, or if she
does win,
with strengths and weaknesses.

40:16.214 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will be a weakness, because
this was
such an easy moment to show some
heart.

40:19.450 --> 40:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it was just
a thrill
to spend the last two weeks with
-- for Gwen

40:24.522 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and me to spend the last two
weeks.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, Judy.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:28.459 --> 40:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You couldn't pass
a polygraph
test right now.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:30.962 --> 40:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We just want you
to go and
get some sleep this weekend,
like the rest

40:32.330 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of us want.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

40:35.333 --> 40:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see
you next Friday.

40:39.771 --> 40:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thanks very much.

40:46.077 --> 40:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
world's great cities
is experiencing a building boom
above ground

40:53.117 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a digging boom below.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown reports from
London.

40:57.155 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our ongoing Culture
at Risk series.

41:00.425 --> 41:07.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Along London's
famous skyline,
cranes and towers of all kinds,
and hundreds

41:07.165 --> 41:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more under construction or in
the planning
stages.

41:10.802 --> 41:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recent Brexit vote may raise
new questions
about the future, but there's no
question

41:15.540 --> 41:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this city has been going through
an unprecedented
reshaping.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Financial Times architecture
critic Edwin
Heathcote.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN HEATHCOTE, Financial
Times: In the center
of the city, there's never been
anything on

41:24.282 --> 41:25.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this scale.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I say never, I mean,
really, there
never has been anything on this
scale.

41:29.354 --> 41:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even after the Great Fire of
London, things
were only rebuilt to five or six
stories.

41:33.524 --> 41:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you say
never, you mean
-- because there's a lot of
history here.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDWIN HEATHCOTE: A lot of
history.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean never.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EDWIN HEATHCOTE: I mean never.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:41.065 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this global
financial capital,
property prices have
skyrocketed, along with

41:44.435 --> 41:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the demand to build, and there's
no place
to go but up.

41:48.973 --> 41:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Heathcote sees individual
buildings
he likes, he worries about the
larger picture.

41:53.444 --> 41:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN HEATHCOTE: Now we have a
much more generic,
much more globalized city, in
which the architecture

41:58.182 --> 42:01.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is much more like Chicago or
Singapore.

42:01.185 --> 42:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is changing in the
texture and the
architectural language and the
materials and

42:06.791 --> 42:08.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the scale.

42:08.659 --> 42:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But even as this
city's future
grows skyward, another part of
London's story,

42:12.930 --> 42:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its past, is being explored in a
very different
direction, below ground.

42:17.001 --> 42:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER KNIGHT, Archaeologist:
If we were
standing here on, say, a lovely
summer's afternoon

42:21.105 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 1590s, we'd actually be
standing on
the stage of the Curtain
Playhouse.

42:25.076 --> 42:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Curtain was
one of the
16th century theaters where
several Shakespeare

42:29.814 --> 42:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plays, including "Romeo and
Juliet," were
first staged.

42:34.652 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The archaeological work here
suggests it was
originally built within a
preexisting tenement

42:39.924 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or apartment house, functioned
as a playhouse
through the golden age of
Elizabethan theater

42:45.430 --> 42:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 16th and 17th centuries,
and then reverted
to residential use, in other
words, like so

42:51.903 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of underground London, use
and re-use,
urban decay and renewal, through
layers of

42:58.743 --> 42:59.977 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Archaeologist Heather Knight:

43:01.579 --> 43:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER KNIGHT: It's not just
the archaeology
of the building we're finding.

43:03.948 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also finding personal
objects, things
that belonged to people who used
this space,

43:08.419 --> 43:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, things like hair combs and,
actually,
at my feet, we have got clay
tobacco pipes.

43:11.722 --> 43:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Literally a pipe?

43:12.723 --> 43:13.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HEATHER KNIGHT: Yes.

43:13.724 --> 43:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can I pick it up?

43:14.725 --> 43:16.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HEATHER KNIGHT: Go on.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will let you.

43:18.162 --> 43:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is this?

43:20.832 --> 43:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD+IT /MD-IT /HEATHER KNIGHT:
So, OK,
well, this dates from around --
that is from

43:25.937 --> 43:27.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around 1740.

43:27.472 --> 43:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you're the first
person to pick
that up in a few hundred years.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's pretty
cool.

43:32.910 --> 43:37.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER KNIGHT: One of the
things we found
that we're quite excited about
is the bird

43:37.348 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
whistle.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like a little ceramic egg
cup.

43:40.685 --> 43:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In any other context, just a
toy, but here,
associated with the playhouse,
could it have

43:45.756 --> 43:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been used in performance?

43:47.558 --> 43:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could it be special effects for,
say, "Romeo
and Juliet," where Juliet is
talking about

43:52.497 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nightingales and larks.

43:54.332 --> 43:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The work on the
Curtain is
being carried out for the
developer of a large

43:58.202 --> 44:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new complex called, yes, The
Stage.

44:01.172 --> 44:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will include a 37-story
residential tower,
two office buildings, retail
stores and restaurants.

44:08.179 --> 44:14.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once finished, the excavation
site will be
part of the development, and
open to the public.

44:14.519 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Developer Robert Allan says the
connection
to the Bard makes this a rare
melding of building

44:19.757 --> 44:21.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and archaeology.

44:21.592 --> 44:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT ALLAN, Developer: That is
one of many
considerations when you come to
do development

44:24.462 --> 44:26.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in London.

44:26.197 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the benefit of the
archaeology, actually,
is it actually can be a positive
as well.

44:28.499 --> 44:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case,
it's such a positive
that you're naming the place The
Stage.

44:32.570 --> 44:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT ALLAN: It is, yes.

44:33.571 --> 44:34.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:34.972 --> 44:36.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So it's sort of
marketing Shakespeare,
in a sense.

44:37.008 --> 44:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT ALLAN: Yes, for us, it's
as good as
it's ever going to get, I think,
to be fair.

44:40.945 --> 44:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Protection of
historical remains
has been required in Britain at
all construction

44:45.917 --> 44:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sites since the early 1990s.

44:49.086 --> 44:53.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many treasures have been
revealed along the
way, including the first
handwritten document

44:53.457 --> 45:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known from Britain at the
excavations for
Bloomberg's new European
headquarters.

45:02.600 --> 45:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mix of development and
archaeology isn't
always smooth, but in London's
largest construction

45:08.072 --> 45:11.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
project of all, it was
unavoidable.

45:11.609 --> 45:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went deep underground for a
look at the
enormous Crossrail project, a
new 73-mile

45:18.049 --> 45:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
east-west railway system due to
open in 2018.

45:22.386 --> 45:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's intended to ease London's
overcrowded
transit system and roads.

45:27.625 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's costly and controversial,
but it's also
led to uncovering more than
10,000 artifacts

45:33.464 --> 45:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that span millions of years.

45:35.032 --> 45:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY CARVER, Crossrail: They're
making new
discoveries every week.

45:37.635 --> 45:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jay Carver serves
as lead archaeologist
for Crossrail.

45:40.738 --> 45:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CARVER: The big challenge
for archaeology
is to integrate with the
construction program.

45:45.676 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's the biggest risk,
discovering something
of complexity that's going to
take a long

45:51.682 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, and if you weren't ready,
prepared for
that, there's going to be a big
problem for

45:55.920 --> 45:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a project like Crossrail.

45:57.788 --> 46:00.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's going to be
a big problem
in terms of, you can't be
building until you

46:00.558 --> 46:01.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with it?

46:01.559 --> 46:03.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY CARVER: That's right.

46:03.494 --> 46:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we spend several years
really researching
in detail every location where
the new railway's

46:06.664 --> 46:08.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to be constructed.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here at what will
be the new
Liverpool Street station, the
archaeology

46:11.669 --> 46:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been completed, but the
findings were
fascinating.

46:14.238 --> 46:20.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAY CARVER: A Roman road
crossing right across
the station construction site,
and alongside

46:20.411 --> 46:25.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Roman road, a burial
ground, quite a
macabre one.

46:25.650 --> 46:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several decapitated burials were
found, and
a large group of skulls
seemingly just on

46:32.223 --> 46:33.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their own.

46:33.691 --> 46:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The site was also a burial
ground from the
16th to the 17th centuries.

46:38.429 --> 46:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have got a new window,
really, on all
these lives of Londoners of that
time, including,

46:46.170 --> 46:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without a doubt, some multiple
burials that
are probably victims of the
Great Plague.

46:50.307 --> 46:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that led to
our last stop,
the Museum of London
Archaeology, a lab where

46:57.048 --> 47:03.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many of the underground
artifacts have been
taken for cleaning, drying,
proper storage,

47:03.688 --> 47:05.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and study.

47:05.523 --> 47:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, we were shown a 1st
century Roman iron
stylus for writing in wax, a
third century

47:12.163 --> 47:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spearhead, and a fragment of
16th century
armor.

47:15.332 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON WALKER, Human Osteologist:
And you can
see quite severe pitting and
actually bone

47:20.604 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
destruction.

47:22.406 --> 47:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then there
was this young
woman, found in the dirt of the
Liverpool

47:25.209 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Street station we'd visited.

47:27.812 --> 47:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don Walker, a human osteologist,
or bone specialist,
said she'd probably died of
syphilis.

47:33.951 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she'd lived in the 1600s, a
period that
saw several major outbreaks of
plague, including

47:39.990 --> 47:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Great Plague of 1665.

47:41.792 --> 47:46.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON WALKER: We know from the
parish records
that people who died of the
Plague were sent

47:46.931 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this burial ground.

47:48.899 --> 47:53.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: DNA from the
teeth of skeletons
like this can be examined and
diseases studied.

47:53.204 --> 47:58.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DON WALKER: Scientists
particular want to
know, what is the relationship
between the

47:58.943 --> 48:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Black Death in the 14th century
and these
later outbreaks in Europe?

48:03.781 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the evolutionary
history?

48:05.816 --> 48:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because we're not very good at
handling or
dealing with new outbreaks of
different diseases

48:10.721 --> 48:11.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or reemerging diseases.

48:11.956 --> 48:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can tell from SARS and AIDS.

48:14.825 --> 48:20.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the more we can know
about the evolution
of such diseases in the past,
the more we

48:20.331 --> 48:22.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can prepare for the future,
perhaps.

48:22.233 --> 48:26.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Secrets
underground that may
help us today, even as the grand
old city

48:27.004 --> 48:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes through the latest of its
changes above.

48:30.274 --> 48:37.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From London, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

48:37.248 --> 48:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where

48:49.860 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

48:52.863 --> 48:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from New York
Times political
reporter Amy Chozick, who has
been providing

48:57.868 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Times with regular coverage
of Hillary
Clinton since her first
presidential run in

49:02.573 --> 49:04.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY CHOZICK, The New York Times:
From the
outside, it looks like, oh,
you're covering

49:06.177 --> 49:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, and it's like
the most exciting
news story of the year.

49:10.047 --> 49:16.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day-to-day is a lot of,
like, schlepping
around to Holiday Inn Expresses,
eating out

49:16.420 --> 49:27.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of your lap in plastic
containers on a bus,
pretty grueling, not all that
glamorous.

49:27.364 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I had been a foreign
correspondent based in
Tokyo with The Wall Street
Journal.

49:32.002 --> 49:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my editors moved me back to
the U.S. and
they said, how would you like to
cover Hillary

49:36.340 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

49:38.075 --> 49:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know what a caucus was,
which the
Clinton people joked with me
years later,

49:40.744 --> 49:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that's OK, they didn't know
what a caucus
was either.

49:42.880 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw Hillary Clinton's arc
from thinking,
oh, I'm assigned to Hillary
Clinton, I'm riding

49:47.451 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this to the White house, to all
of a sudden
seeing her lose to Obama and
also, when she

49:51.956 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was losing, become a very
different type of
candidate, less guarded, more
willing to communicate

49:57.027 --> 50:01.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the reporters who traveled
with her,
just sort of having fun when it
looked like

50:01.332 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she had nothing left to lose.

50:03.133 --> 50:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She would do this famous game
that -- the
campaign trail, and that was
rolling oranges

50:07.238 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down the aisle of the plane.

50:09.039 --> 50:12.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The press sits in the back,
would write a
question on the orange and roll
it up to the

50:12.977 --> 50:14.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
front of the plane.

50:14.111 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then she writes her answer
and rolls it
back.

50:15.813 --> 50:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, my editor said, OK, that's
enough.

50:17.781 --> 50:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We really need you to go be with
the Obama
campaign.

50:20.251 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw him, just, you know, keep
a crowd just
raptured.

50:24.555 --> 50:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my takeaway was that this
guy is incredibly
charming to a crowd of 50,000
people, and

50:29.293 --> 50:31.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary is incredibly charming
to a crowd
of five, you know?

50:31.729 --> 50:34.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's been a struggle for
her current
campaign.

50:34.331 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a pretty historic
phenomenon that this
first female nominee of a major
party has

50:39.436 --> 50:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a predominantly female press
corps covering
her.

50:42.706 --> 50:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we think about it
very much,
you know, on a day to day, but
it's certainly

50:46.343 --> 50:50.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more female than 2008 or any of
the press
corps I have seen.

50:50.848 --> 50:54.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Writing a tough story about a
candidate who
you're going to see the next
day, whose advisers

50:54.985 --> 50:58.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to be in very close
contact with
the next day, is inherently
awkward.

50:58.856 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Hillary Clinton, I know she
takes these
things pretty personally, the
coverage, but

51:03.460 --> 51:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also always think of her as
one of those,
like, kid's dolls that you punch
and they

51:08.165 --> 51:09.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bounce back up.

51:09.934 --> 51:13.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she has bounced back
from so much
difficult coverage, whether it's
Whitewater,

51:13.671 --> 51:14.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monica.

51:14.672 --> 51:16.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you could -- decades of
coverage.

51:16.607 --> 51:22.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's very much
formed her impression
of the political media, rightly
and wrongly.

51:22.680 --> 51:26.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's not a lot she
hasn't seen at
this point.

51:26.150 --> 51:31.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Amy Chozick, and this
is my Brief
But Spectacular take on covering
Hillary Clinton.

51:31.088 --> 51:37.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

52:01.485 --> 52:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later this evening.

52:05.022 --> 52:05.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview:

52:06.023 --> 52:07.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hello Judy.

52:07.825 --> 52:12.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After two weeks on the road,
we're back in
the home studio with a lot of
questions to

52:12.529 --> 52:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
answer, chief among them: Now
that it's official,
what is this general election
race going to

52:18.335 --> 52:19.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
look like?

52:19.570 --> 52:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will it be a tweetstorm, or an
old-fashioned
bus tour?

52:23.607 --> 52:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And is it the toss-up so many
pollsters are
predicting?

52:26.410 --> 52:31.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will do our best to tackle it
all tonight
on "Washington Week" -- Judy.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Gwen.

52:32.716 --> 52:34.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be watching.

52:34.284 --> 52:39.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour Weekend":
climate refugees
right here in the United States.

52:39.456 --> 52:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the past 60
years, 98
percent of this island has
disappeared.

52:45.529 --> 52:51.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what it looked like in
1963, about
11-miles-long and
five-miles-wide.

52:51.235 --> 52:55.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what it looks like
today, about two-miles-long
and a quarter-of-a-mile-wide.

52:55.339 --> 53:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are multiple causes for
the continuing
land loss, including decades of
oil and gas
