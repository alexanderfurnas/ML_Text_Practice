11:20.580 --> 11:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fans chanted that was targeted
we know in deeper fact now that
the gunman who

11:24.717 --> 11:29.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not been identified was
targeting Planned Parenthood for
what remains

11:29.255 --> 11:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unknown reason it's also known
that he brought devices that
could be dangerous

11:35.295 --> 11:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pleaser they need to take
several hours now to go in and
check out the whole

11:39.132 --> 11:44.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing to see if those devices
are safe represent a threat so
he did go there

11:44.203 --> 11:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well armed with the weapon he
was using other item was
targeting that situation

11:49.909 --> 11:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the nearby shop of course on
lockdown because there was so
much

11:55.114 --> 11:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uncertainty about who was
actually being targeted
initially and whether there

11:59.719 --> 12:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could be more powerful than
they're done the danger is that
the immediate

12:03.656 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security situation give us an
idea of the atmosphere there
mean that the

12:07.260 --> 12:12.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pictures that we've seen or a
number of different police
agencies from local to

12:12.298 --> 12:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Nationals that's right they
do get a list of some of the
agencies involved

12:16.836 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finding the Eid el Paso County

their loved ones who might have
been out shopping getting their
hair cut it

12:47.467 --> 12:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

while we're at the Planned

12:51.204 --> 12:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which was open for business just
like any other day to make sure
that their

12:54.440 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loved ones were safe

12:57.343 --> 13:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finally this is a process that
happened throughout the day

13:01.781 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not everybody was released at
the same time that's right and
from the

information coming out now
against them at the latest press
conference was still

13:07.754 --> 13:10.056 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ongoing

13:10.056 --> 13:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it appears that people are still
inside of what I've heard and
again the gunman

13:13.526 --> 13:15.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has been removed

13:15.762 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so it's not been created an
active situation but the
officials said they

13:20.900 --> 13:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needed to go check and see the
people who were there were
injured which means

13:25.071 --> 13:29.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's still a situation that
very much ongoing feature story

flashbacks of the gunman very
clear there's been a dream that
has occurred

14:54.627 --> 14:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several times about me being in
the whole way of my house and
looking down

14:57.864 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a sitting room and I can see
shadows on the wall and I'm I'm
with my travel

15:02.268 --> 15:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friend who was with me in Paris
I turned around to Satan look
look there's

15:06.539 --> 15:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a break in the best
thieves in the in the sitting
room I turned around

15:10.977 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at him so no worries
behind me in a dream I look back
he's not there

15:15.081 --> 15:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I look forward again to look
into the living room and the
government is

15:18.985 --> 15:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right in front of me shooting at
me this time last yr wake up
you're going to be

15:23.523 --> 15:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permanently damaged I know I
don't think that all is that
because you personally

15:29.128 --> 15:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and professionally have the
tools that enable you to deal
with this

15:33.099 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yeah I think I mean I've been
denounced therapy since I was 19
mins been always

15:37.270 --> 15:42.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be my interest has been
psychotherapy psychology
somewhere that I have tools

15:42.308 --> 15:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quite robust sense of self so
what's the tools using two to
make sure that you're

15:48.748 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to heal things that aren't
stimulating anything this
relaxing so

15:53.052 --> 15:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what I've done is I've moved
most of my work around so I'm
working as little as

15:57.723 --> 16:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible for next two weeks and
making sure I take things easy
with good

16:02.728 --> 16:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friends you know walking rather
than running driving slowly
rather than

16:06.232 --> 16:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
driving to a bit too fast

16:09.068 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spacing out my appointment so I
don't get agitated or stressed
most of those

16:14.307 --> 16:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
caught up in the Paris attacks
were civilians unlike members of
the armed

16:18.244 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces or emergency services
most civilians don't have the
training or

16:22.114 --> 16:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental armor to be able to cope
with images of carnage Marco
clubs area of

16:27.119 --> 16:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expertise does not extend to
terrorism and so he sought out a
psychologist who

16:32.124 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specializes in treating victims
of torture and soldiers were
given a

16:37.630 --> 16:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
headphone and then you choose a
sound that you like and then you
choose a

16:43.603 --> 16:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movement that you like and you
choose a memory that you like
and so you have a

16:47.240 --> 16:51.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
memory in your mind and you have
a movement of your body and you
have an

16:51.110 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
input from one of your senses
you're hearing and then by
combining those

16:54.947 --> 17:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three you have a safe space like
a feeling of a safe memory and
from that

17:00.319 --> 17:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe space you then revisit the
traumatic experience which for
me was

17:05.057 --> 17:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the the shooting so rather than
being completely caught with all
my guard down

17:10.997 --> 17:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as I was that Friday night I can
then revisited with my god
someone up again

17:15.735 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I'm not we're part of me
is in Paris and part of me is in
my state

17:21.073 --> 17:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space and to me is diving I've
done a lot of diving knives
younger so I could

17:26.345 --> 17:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a dive site I went too often
in Egypt I was there you
visualize

17:31.150 --> 17:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visualizing you have a movement
you have a sound that go with it
goes with it it

17:35.788 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
makes it quite easy to Orissa
easier to have a safe space with
me when i'm

17:41.661 --> 17:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking back about traumatic
experience the shooting was
survivor's guilt is a

17:47.099 --> 17:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
common reaction among those
embroiled in violence disasters
or other tragedies

17:51.003 --> 17:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but not coke love is determined
to maximize another image

17:55.841 --> 18:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response something he calls
survivors obligation I think the
obligation to

18:01.047 --> 18:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
live to live fully and to give
something back to the people
that I meet in my

18:06.319 --> 18:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life I saw for people's lives
extinguished very very quickly
right in

18:11.490 --> 18:16.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front of me and that I was that
obligation is that to give
something

18:16.195 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back to the people I meet in the
course of my life not just
prefer

18:20.166 --> 18:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professionally or personally and
whenever I feel like relaxing or
just

18:24.704 --> 18:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrapping myself up in my own
bubble and chilling out for a
bit then that's wrong

18:29.041 --> 18:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember that for people who I
saw no longer have the
opportunity to give

18:33.512 --> 18:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something to somebody else
could be a loved one family

18:37.116 --> 18:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bus driver could be anybody
anybody in the street the
pedestrian random the

18:40.720 --> 18:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kurds and that will keep me in a
more living space rather than in
more

18:48.394 --> 18:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reclusive contact me they're
closed down space that makes
sense so is that

18:53.632 --> 19:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that all of the
survivors have to do individual
part I was a all the

19:00.573 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who were in shock but
witnessed getting people getting
shot or similar

19:06.312 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things they will get to take
home with them something
meaningful from that

19:10.449 --> 19:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
event and I really really hope
they take something where they
find more meaning

19:14.987 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rather than less me in the UK is
there any justification feeling
guilty about

19:19.859 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surviving

19:25.297 --> 19:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a process I think when
people see other people getting
shot dead when

19:33.039 --> 19:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civilians other civilians
getting shot down it's a process
we have to go

19:37.343 --> 19:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through to figure out you know
should have done more could have
done more but

19:42.114 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what if I had them or what would
have been what my contribution
have been then

19:47.386 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think these are very
existential questions that you
run into when you see

19:51.524 --> 19:54.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people getting shot
right in front of you

gangs in the country

21:54.346 --> 21:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but unlike many gang members
McSwain escaped later finishing
college and

21:59.618 --> 22:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming a journalist who
reported on gangs and look for
solutions in 2010

22:05.157 --> 22:10.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
McSwain became executive
director of the twenty year old
wooden center founded by

22:10.262 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her late model favored room she
set up storefront havens to get
children off

22:15.701 --> 22:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South LA's mean streets after
her thirty five-year-old son L
wooden was killed in

22:21.140 --> 22:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of them in a drive-by
shooting now and next wave thank
you for joining us

22:26.478 --> 22:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think most of our viewers will
want to know right away how did
you get out of

22:31.217 --> 22:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the gang life my mother she saw
her daughter changing I went
from

22:38.290 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practically straight-a student
to practically Street test this
was in high

22:43.229 --> 22:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school and I was doing drugs she
didn't know all of that but she
saw the signs

22:48.367 --> 22:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it you know my belligerents
truancy she pretty much all my
grades and my

22:53.572 --> 22:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attitude changing but it was
because of the gang activity at
a drugs and I was

22:57.509 --> 23:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing so what did she do she did
two things one she sent me the
church I was

23:03.282 --> 23:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
16 years old and I remember her
saying those church people are
the only one

23:07.219 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that can help you and the second
thing she did was she enrolled
me and I youth

23:11.290 --> 23:16.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
center and I self-destruction
and it was right here in Los
Angeles and they

23:16.795 --> 23:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually pay this to come we we
got minimum wage so it was a
great incentive

23:20.866 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go and with the two of those
to church on the one hand to
Jimmy about

23:25.137 --> 23:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morals and making me think about
the things that I was doing and
then the

23:29.208 --> 23:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Youth Center given me that
practical they actually help me
fill out my

23:33.479 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
financially and college
applications they talked to me
about my attitude and

23:38.584 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so between the two of those
things change but it seems is of
little has

23:44.256 --> 23:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really changed that in your life
of course but there's so many
gangs still

23:48.193 --> 23:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this area and all over the
country it's still not as bad as
it was back did

23:53.465 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the eighties and nineties but
still right now you have some of
the highest

23:58.270 --> 24:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates of gang violence that you
had in the past I'm seeing a
resurgence you

24:03.776 --> 24:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know I've heard stories you know
I have talked to some of the
young man I've

24:09.048 --> 24:13.686 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
talked to police
ask that question

24:13.686 --> 24:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the the police say have
told me is that some of the
coming out of prison

24:20.392 --> 24:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're coming back and saying
you know what have you guys been
putting in work

24:25.564 --> 24:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know why haven't you settle
these old debts and so they you
know gotten

24:32.171 --> 24:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the Union engaged in
this that's what the police have
said in an area

24:36.575 --> 24:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this is so few jobs this so
few opportunities for young
people that

24:40.646 --> 24:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
drive them into the gang life

24:44.516 --> 24:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first thing when I want to say
is it's not simple you know
there's no one

24:48.754 --> 24:53.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
solution every child is
different but for the most part
the young men have

24:53.926 --> 25:00.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told me you know yes we need
jobs we need education those
things we need they

25:00.399 --> 25:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
realize that they need and
substance abuse treatment

25:03.836 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know because for the most
part it you're not working you
don't have any

25:07.005 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money that's that's a great
motivation to steal I have one
and he told me he

25:13.746 --> 25:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got arrested for case the liquor
store and he ran and he was
hungry and he

25:17.983 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't have a job
and have the money

25:20.652 --> 25:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and still something and you know
get arrested for it they say
that you know

25:26.792 --> 25:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's black-on-black crime and
why are black people taking
ownership you see

25:31.230 --> 25:34.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what you're doing with
these young people

25:34.867 --> 25:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affecting racism well we we tell
the kids that you're all
brothers and

25:40.205 --> 25:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sisters you know we're primarily
african-american Latino here we
told him

25:45.077 --> 25:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the city of Los Angeles was
founded by by Mexicans and a
number of them of

25:50.783 --> 25:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Africans who said so we say that
you're actually in a city that
was born

25:55.354 --> 25:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
multicultural so you have no
reason fighting because you are
you related so

25:59.391 --> 26:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we we get them to buy into that
you know we are family and they
love that so how

26:03.462 --> 26:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you get the children in here
when there's so much temptation
in the

26:07.466 --> 26:09.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
streets

26:09.568 --> 26:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yeah the parents the parents
want their kids to succeed just
about every parent

26:14.640 --> 26:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that i've talked to they come in
the door and they say can you
help my child

26:17.509 --> 26:21.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know like most mostly
because of education they want
to hurry so they

26:21.980 --> 26:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largely come for that but
there's that small number that's
you know he's

26:26.552 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trouble he's getting mixed up
with gays can you help them so
that's why we have

26:29.855 --> 26:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a life skills programs so we we
deal with that we have the
discussion groups

26:34.893 --> 26:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the young man with a talk
about life and what drives you
and what

26:40.933 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened to you because that's
that's where we were found there
he was killed

26:45.637 --> 26:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it became very personal you see
it in the news but when it hits
home it really

26:50.742 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hurts so you share all this with
these children and they can
handle it is not

26:54.947 --> 26:59.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
too traumatic know it's
interesting whenever we tell
them the story the room

26:59.751 --> 27:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goes quiet they could be talking
in chattering and then I i say
you know my

27:03.455 --> 27:05.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cousin was killed

27:05.791 --> 27:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goals quiet is very respectful
and I asked them you know has
this ever

27:12.030 --> 27:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened to you and your family
been shot in the reason his my
local my dad

27:17.402 --> 27:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my mom you know they have their
own stories and gives very
emotional and so

27:23.075 --> 27:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I I just tell them I say that's
why we're here we don't want
this to happen

27:28.080 --> 27:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to you and they they listen
that's one of the greatest
motivator for homework

27:33.819 --> 27:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I i bring it around and
I say you know being educated
you'll be able

27:39.525 --> 27:43.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get a great job our own your
own company and and you won't
have to still

27:43.962 --> 27:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you have money you know
I explain it to them like that I
said

27:47.900 --> 27:53.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's why you do your homework
if you don't learn that you're
not going to be

27:53.038 --> 27:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to do it when you go to
college so you need to learn it
now you know and

27:57.042 --> 28:01.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just break it down to them and
explain to them and they say
they go off and

28:01.179 --> 28:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they do their homework so it's
real simple you know I mean I
just wish more

28:05.817 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people would try it so what is
your goal here at the center and
how you achieving

28:08.687 --> 28:11.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

28:11.189 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
academic excellence and good
citizenship that's our mission
statement the United

28:15.694 --> 28:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Way says there's a direct
correlation between education
and crime people who

28:19.798 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are more educated or less likely
to commit crime because they
have the money

28:23.769 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't have to run into a
liquor store is still a baguette
chips and so

28:27.673 --> 28:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're real heavy on education
making sure I kids can go to
college if they

28:31.677 --> 28:37.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
want to are you at all
optimistic that you can overcome
the challenges that so

28:37.149 --> 28:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many communities like this face
you can't say the whole world
God never even

28:41.453 --> 28:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called you to stay the whole
world that's the reason why he
has people

28:44.122 --> 28:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working in different places so
you have to just find your niche
in the world and

28:48.927 --> 28:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do your best at that and to
support and partner with others
about you can thank

28:52.698 --> 29:05.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

race between them is starting to
come into focus I feel like I've
been at the

29:42.648 --> 29:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movies for way too long watching
way too many previews and the
main feature

29:47.653 --> 29:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hasn't even started yet but
there is some jelling in the

remaining

30:07.806 --> 30:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contenders wanna make a move
everybody thinks they're going
to get hit by

30:11.677 --> 30:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lightning and maybe somebody
will the question is whether or
not they can

30:17.149 --> 30:22.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottle that lightning and carry
it through other races a close
look at the

30:22.988 --> 30:28.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

potential nominees in late
August donald Trump in

30:28.460 --> 30:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
red was soaring but the rest
of the pack was close together

30:33.198 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
October ben Carson in blue broke
away but again the rest of the
field was a

30:38.737 --> 30:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
model of dots now this month a
few weeks of consistency Carson
down as Marco

Rubio and crews especially
this is a critical moment

30:56.021 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez
the reason she knows why
increased concerns about

31:01.560 --> 31:06.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism Isis and national
security because of that you're
starting to see

31:06.198 --> 31:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some movement with Ted Cruz
Marco Rubio who've been talking
about foreign policy

31:10.068 --> 31:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strongly to taking a stronger
stand against lights and what
they would do in

their role at the white house
newbios rise comes as he spent
more time talking

31:19.144 --> 31:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about how he would deal with
Isis this is a civilizational
struggle between the

31:24.783 --> 31:29.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
values of freedom and liberty
and radical Islamic terror what
happened in

31:29.454 --> 31:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paris could happen here there is
no middle ground I approve this
message

31:34.860 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
because there can be no
arrangement or negotiation
either they when are we do

31:59.217 --> 32:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself admits it cannot get
these refugees to determine if
they're Isis

32:05.257 --> 32:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists and better among them
if those to stay on their
current hat into

32:09.995 --> 32:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a head-to-head competition with
Donald Trump it could force an
even broader

32:14.332 --> 32:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy faceoff idea of
building a safe zone in Syria
we've had a fairly

32:19.871 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effective bombing campaign over
the last couple days we have to
deal with them

32:23.241 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a position of strength so
think of this as the critical
build-up to Iowa

32:27.078 --> 32:29.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the early state votes

32:29.948 --> 32:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates that have been
propped up by the polls are
going to have to start

32:33.451 --> 32:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proving that they can get votes
in these actual primaries and
caucuses states and

32:38.690 --> 32:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's when the real fight will
begin it may not yet be the real
fight but voters

32:44.095 --> 32:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be starting to separate who
has enough muscle to make it to
the final

32:48.700 --> 32:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
round for the PBS Newshour I'm
Lisa Desjardins and that brings
us to the

32:54.072 --> 32:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
analysis of shields and Brooks
that is syndicated columnist
Mark shields and

32:58.343 --> 33:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York Times columnist David
Brooks gentlemen welcome and I
do want to get

33:02.948 --> 33:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the presidential campaign in
just a moment but Mark I wanna
start with the

33:05.717 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story that we reported
earlier this evening

33:08.353 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a protest in Chicago about the
shooting last year young black
teenager by a

33:14.726 --> 33:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white Chicago policeman has now
been charged with murder what
does this in

33:19.264 --> 33:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these other police shootings
we've seen over the past year
say about efforts to

33:23.668 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heal the relationship between
police and the black communities

33:30.041 --> 33:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well it's it's a continuing
challenge and terrible tragedy
personally in this

33:37.949 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case we have this that age old
question who will protect the
people when the

33:45.023 --> 33:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police violate the law and from
every indication here you have
all the

33:51.263 --> 33:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence pointing to a police
officer essentially executing a
seventeen year

33:56.902 --> 34:04.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
old boy and the authorities
sitting on it for 400 days
prosecuting attorney not

34:04.776 --> 34:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going forward and take me beyond
the beyond the tragedy it's the
other story

34:11.917 --> 34:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reported on was that of Taishan
lead at nine year old a nine
year old who was

34:16.454 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed as a basically a hostage
as retribution in a gang fight
within the

34:22.360 --> 34:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community there's no tougher job
in America being a competent be
in a major

34:26.831 --> 34:30.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city in this country

34:30.302 --> 34:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big rally and good cops what
happened in Chicago Chicago
execution and that's I

34:38.243 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they are you can call it
it makes the cop on the beat the
overwhelming

34:44.115 --> 34:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good that much tougher David we
keep reporting on these
incidents and we

34:50.455 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we've turned a corner but
then they just seem to keep
happening you

34:56.494 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know we need structural change
this and they were since 2007
there have been

35:00.899 --> 35:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four hundred police shootings in
Chicago and only one of them has
been ruled

35:04.035 --> 35:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unjustified that's just not
credible and so you better have
some structural

35:08.506 --> 35:10.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
changes and I listen i
understand why there has to be
loyalty within the

35:10.275 --> 35:12.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police force

35:12.477 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically loyalty within the
criminal justice system I was a
police reporter

35:15.280 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chicago time when it was way
more violent even that is right
now

35:18.550 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that stuff and they they
they want to protect each other
and I get that and

35:22.287 --> 35:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the situations are often murky
but you have to build structures
so that when

35:26.558 --> 35:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is something that goes
wrong there actually is really a
prosecutorial for

35:31.763 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somewhere than the system
looking at the system from
hostile I and saying that

35:36.601 --> 35:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something really bad happened
here and if they're exonerating

35:40.305 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
99.8% of the cops were shooting
people that's probably not right
and so there

35:46.011 --> 35:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has to be a structured to really
investigate these situations and
you

35:50.448 --> 35:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know I've been moving on the
comp cam issue when the these
things for start

35:53.618 --> 35:57.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happening I was sort of
ambivalent about Comp Cams
because I think they will

35:57.188 --> 36:03.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
affect this civil police
relationship if everyone knows
everything films but the

36:03.161 --> 36:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence is mounting that these
cameras and we have another
desperate cam in

36:06.398 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this case the evidence is
mounting these are effective and
maybe Cup should be

36:10.335 --> 36:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wearing cameras that were about
cameras public opinion in fact
that these things

36:15.006 --> 36:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are getting attention in the
news media cannot make it if I
think the value of

36:20.311 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cameras is demonstrated in
this case and it is great value
to the the artist

36:27.118 --> 36:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got the good cop as well and
David mentions to 400 police
officers have

36:33.458 --> 36:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been charged in chicago won
shooting of which has been
called unjustified

36:37.762 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those 400 this is a city that
that s budget problems like no
other city in

36:43.268 --> 36:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country really and they paid
out five hundred million dollars
in

36:48.239 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
settlements because of the
shootings so I mean it it's a
real problem no one can

36:55.547 --> 37:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question david I wanna I wanna
turned this this Friday today
two weeks after

37:01.386 --> 37:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the horrible shootings in Paris
the terrorist attacks is there a
sense that

37:07.425 --> 37:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this efforts you know whether
it's president Hollande of
France President

37:12.363 --> 37:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama anyone else that the
efforts to put together some
kind of effective

37:16.601 --> 37:22.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition effort to fight Isis
is any stronger today as a
result of what

37:22.607 --> 37:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened when I get a little
clarity I mean it's the what's
the definition in

37:26.411 --> 37:28.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effect

37:28.246 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition to meet the definition
in effect of coalition has now
been very

37:31.716 --> 37:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bland involved or the russians
because they want to keep Assad
and most of the

37:37.021 --> 37:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of the world wants to get
rid of Assad knowing that Assad
is the key

37:39.624 --> 37:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
source of the problem here he's
the one who created the
instability in the

37:42.827 --> 37:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
genocide the league's decision
is to radicalize and embrace
Isis and so there

37:48.233 --> 37:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was this myth that shimmer in
the early days that we're gonna
have a global

37:51.569 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliance including Putin and
these words coming out of the
crime Wednesday and

37:56.374 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
according to the controversy
that Russia's having a turkey
that grand jury

38:01.713 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which was a bad dream is falling
apart whether we can create a
western alliance

38:05.884 --> 38:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Gulf states to defeat
us is another matter but the key
to it is

38:10.388 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting the Sunnis we don't have
the boots on the ground were not
gonna put

38:13.791 --> 38:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the words on the ground if the
reasonable soon as a revolt
against Isis

38:16.728 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then nothing will happen and
they're not gonna do it as long
as Assad is really

38:20.932 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raining genocide down upon them
so understanding the basic logic
of the

38:23.101 --> 38:25.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation

38:25.370 --> 38:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complex logical situation is
really the key think you see any
progress I ICIC

38:31.075 --> 38:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well partly I think there's been
a galvanizing support and
energizing Mrs

38:38.583 --> 38:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merkel in Germany and that most
peaceful of great powers
contributing to the

38:46.191 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effort it's Prime Minister
Cameron and in great britain I
i'm i'm not a book I

38:53.965 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know up front but Putin is a tax
out of self-interest that that's
it

39:00.538 --> 39:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he recognized is that Assad
days are numbered and he's gone
and I i don't

39:06.544 --> 39:09.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a problem with him

39:09.447 --> 39:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hastening that departure i just
i just really think that there
is an everyday I

39:16.854 --> 39:23.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel badly for the president
because he has a great ability
to express passion

39:23.261 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and emotion in a public setting
as he did in charleston did it

39:28.466 --> 39:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newtown and in this case he is
his words failed him he hasn't
why do you think

39:35.573 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is why I don't i think i
think because he was elected to
end to wars

39:38.309 --> 39:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's been committed to that

39:40.745 --> 39:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's no question about it
said it's a belief and
conviction on his part I

39:45.617 --> 39:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think he also understand he
becomes more nuanced and more
cerebral which is at

39:50.521 --> 39:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all times but especially in
matters of national security and
foreign policy

39:54.259 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engagement I think he also
understands that the United
States is not going to

39:59.297 --> 40:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead in this in the to some
degree there is an advantage to
the other countries

40:04.435 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually taken militarily mark I
mean David how do you see the
president

40:10.241 --> 40:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming coming to this effort
nobody feels good sitting by
while genocide

40:15.446 --> 40:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens and doing nothing and
that's essentially what has been
done I know

40:18.283 --> 40:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bill Clinton has said many times
since he left office is greatest
regret was

40:21.819 --> 40:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowing the genocide in Rwanda
to happen and Barack Obama for
good reasons

40:25.823 --> 40:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are bad as that by while the
slow rolling genocides happen in
Syria and it

40:31.229 --> 40:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could have been prevented but
people within his own
administration were

40:33.598 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urging action very early in ways
that maybe could have made a
difference but

40:38.002 --> 40:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said bye and and and let it
happen again maybe America no
choice but we did

40:43.141 --> 40:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing and so it's hard to feel
good about the American rollover
in Syria

40:47.645 --> 40:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the past five or seven
years and if you don't feel good
about it it's hard

40:50.615 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to wax poetic and self-righteous
about it I want to turn you both
quickly to

40:54.786 --> 41:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the presidential campaign when
asked about Rubio and cruise but
first about

41:00.491 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump mark that the story
that really has persisted all
week that the

41:05.363 --> 41:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claims that donald Trump is made
that there were thousands of
people in New

41:08.800 --> 41:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jersey cheering after the twin
towers went down there's as far
as I've seen

41:14.439 --> 41:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have looked there's no
evidence has come forward to
support that but he

41:18.609 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues to insist it happen
he's not backing down how does
this fit into a

41:23.948 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential campaign does it
make any difference does it
change anything that

41:28.519 --> 41:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a candidate says something that
can't be substantially release
it hasn't been as

41:32.690 --> 41:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far as I mean if we play we say
it's unsubstantiated I mean it
it's

41:38.496 --> 41:44.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
demonstrably false it's
irresponsible it's untrue and
you know we have

41:44.836 --> 41:48.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
predicted nine times

41:48.539 --> 41:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the demise and premature fall of
Donald Trump on this this
podcast same lies ppl

41:57.949 --> 42:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think predicted that republican
voters will choose a governor
and you sign

42:02.387 --> 42:06.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leases piece that the
first three people out

42:06.491 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Scott Walker Governor
Rick Perry and Governor Bobby
Jindal so but

42:11.362 --> 42:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's cumulus it has to be
republican voters focus and at
some point they do

42:16.434 --> 42:20.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on wanting to elect a president
they have to know that somebody
who is

42:20.705 --> 42:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contradicted in basic facts is
openly and completely as he is

42:26.611 --> 42:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becomes unacceptable electrical
David how do you see the fallout
from this

42:31.048 --> 42:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yeah I'm doubling down on my
demise theory i think is gonna
collapse I think

42:36.587 --> 42:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's gonna be like sitting
taking the Oval Office and some
january first I'll

42:40.057 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still be predicting demise but
here's my here's my state of the
week for why I

42:45.396 --> 42:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still think that's gonna happen
every four years after iowa new
hampshire

42:49.467 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boats they asked about her when
did you make up your mind and
they make up their

42:53.504 --> 42:57.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mind like a week before a day
before a month before they don't
do it three

42:57.341 --> 43:00.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months before not that many and
so eighty percent of the voters
are still

43:00.711 --> 43:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
undecided Nate Silver had a good
church today in his on his
website or this week

43:05.783 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bruce if the polls are
accurately reflecting the way
the real state of the

43:08.186 --> 43:11.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
race it would say eighty
percent undecided

43:11.556 --> 43:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by percent Trump 4% Rubio three
percent crews and I think that's
really where

43:16.127 --> 43:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the race is people may say
they're voting for Trump but
they really make up

43:19.564 --> 43:23.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their mind last weeks or months
and we are simply just not there
yet so I'm

43:23.634 --> 43:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convinced demise alright finally
with less than a minute let's
get back to the

43:29.507 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point at least they shared a
maid marking her piece Rubio and
cruise is

43:33.511 --> 43:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David just mention they are
hanging in there in the middle

43:37.782 --> 43:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what do you see them doing to
distinguish themselves from each
other

43:39.884 --> 43:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and you got less than 30 seconds

43:42.820 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
well forty four-year-old
cuban-americans Forbes island
states basically Ted Cruz

43:50.194 --> 43:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is operating whose it incredibly
talented debate I've never seen
anybody

43:53.064 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better

43:54.999 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went on to say presidential
politics but operate on a false
premise and that is

43:59.036 --> 44:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there are millions of
conservative voters who it's by
the tax and despising

44:03.541 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barack Obama many of them didn't
chose not to vote in 2008 2012

44:08.946 --> 44:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
republicans did not nominate
somebody who is this true blue
conservatives he

44:12.483 --> 44:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to come out in droves
if he's the nominee wrong David
Cruz Ruby its

he's talking about shutting down
the government and he's very
anti-immigrant

44:28.533 --> 44:32.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aruba was much more in the

immigration hopeful about
American foreign policy so we'll
see what

44:36.574 --> 44:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emotional tone Republican Party
is ready for a suspect it's the
Rubio won but who

44:41.479 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows I promise your gonna get
more time to talk about this in
the future David

44:44.916 --> 44:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brooks mark shields thank you

communicating in person in our

concern of our latest add to the
NewsHour bookshelf and
reclaiming

45:08.506 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

sherry Turkle of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology continues her

45:17.582 --> 45:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exploration of the evolving
relationship between technology
and humans she

45:22.853 --> 45:28.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently sat down with jeffrey
Brown sherry Turkle welcome to
you pleasure to

45:28.292 --> 45:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be close to me we're having a
conversation about the lack of

45:31.062 --> 45:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversations in our lives when
you see something very specific
problem a loss

45:36.701 --> 45:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of empathy of our ability to
empathize with others explained
that well it's

45:42.974 --> 45:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very typical that when two
people are having lunch they put
a phone on the

45:47.778 --> 45:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table between them and all the
research shows that the presence
of that phone

45:52.583 --> 45:58.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will do two things to the
conversation it will make the
conversation go to

45:58.789 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trial matters and it will
decrease the amount of empathy
that the two people in

46:04.328 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the conversation feel toward
each other that phone is a
signal that either of us

46:09.266 --> 46:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can put our attention elsewhere
even if we don't look at it even
a silent phone

46:14.772 --> 46:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discounts and so it's that
feeling that we all are always
potentially elsewhere

46:20.678 --> 46:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is that it is cutting us
off and we're finding ways
around conversation

46:27.318 --> 46:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of conversation that
open-ended where you you give
time for another

46:32.790 --> 46:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person to sort of take attention
and not go to a phone if there's
a little bit of

46:37.895 --> 46:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the laps and those are the kinds
of conversations where NBC was
born where

46:42.333 --> 46:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intimacy is born and those are
the kind of conversations were
not having with

46:46.137 --> 46:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other and with our kids and
I'm wondering if the instruments
the

46:49.974 --> 46:55.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology kind of please just
pleased to these sort of natural
human anxiety

46:55.479 --> 46:58.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over you know talking
to one of her

46:58.949 --> 47:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another or the fear of human
contact that we might have
always had and the

47:04.355 --> 47:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new technology helps that well
in my book i argued that we are
vulnerable to

47:09.193 --> 47:14.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these technologies there's a 40%
decline and all markers for
empathy among

47:14.298 --> 47:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college students with most of it
taking place in the past 10
years that's not

47:22.006 --> 47:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
okay so even if meet our phones
do play to our natural
nervousness about being

47:29.814 --> 47:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vulnerable to each other but
that doesn't mean that we can't
we can't pull

47:36.554 --> 47:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ourselves together and say we
need to talk to each other
because it's in

47:40.858 --> 47:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation the most human and
humanizing thing that we do that
empathy

47:46.731 --> 47:51.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is born that intimacy us-born
that relationship as borne do
you see these

47:51.168 --> 47:57.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
new kinds of gadgets as
exponentially different from
other technology isn't it

47:57.742 --> 48:01.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also the case that new
technology is its come along
from the technology of the

48:01.946 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
book yes it's Socrates talking
about or the telephone or the
television of

48:06.884 --> 48:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course the couch potato the idea
that we're just focused now we
look at the

48:12.022 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
television is something we
almost share my yes all this
technology and the

48:16.827 --> 48:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reason this technology took my
attention so much is that it it
does something new

48:22.767 --> 48:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is that we have the
illusion that we're with each
other even as I'm going

48:28.873 --> 48:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this we're sharing but
we're not really yes we we
treated as though with

48:32.910 --> 48:39.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an accessory that has no
psychological impact I just go
like this and I'm I'm

48:39.784 --> 48:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with you but I'm also with my
phone and actually that gesture
has tremendous

48:44.188 --> 48:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
psychological effect but because
we're sort of with each other
all the time

48:47.992 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's an old

48:50.661 --> 48:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
always on always i'm new
technology we can interrupt the
flow of life but

48:56.300 --> 49:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somehow not taken seriously in
in the latest Pew study
eighty-nine percent of

49:00.738 --> 49:06.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Americans said that they
interrupted their last social
encounter by looking

49:06.010 --> 49:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a phone and eighty-two
percent of them said that it
deteriorated the

49:09.180 --> 49:11.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversation

49:11.415 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so weird my favorite line in my
book kind of author's choice
technologies

49:17.087 --> 49:21.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology makes us forget what
we know about life we know we're
doing something

49:21.792 --> 49:25.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that that's not good

49:25.296 --> 49:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put your hand up in somebody's
face and say excuse me I just
need to interrupt

49:28.866 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this conversation for a moment
and yet we do it anyway how far
do you want to

49:34.004 --> 49:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
push this in terms of turning
off tuning out unplugging you
know not multitasking

49:41.312 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how far to push it what you want
people to do I want people to
take action and

49:46.150 --> 49:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reclaim conversation in the
following ways this book is not
anti-technology

49:50.955 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its pro conversation if you're
using technology in a way that
opens out

49:56.994 --> 50:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation and your family
with your friends with you
people you care about

50:01.365 --> 50:08.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
i'm for that but if you're using
technology to silence the
conversations

50:08.138 --> 50:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the people around you then
you have to create sacred spaces
in your home the

50:13.077 --> 50:18.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kitchen the dining room the car
for me the car is ground zero in
the in the war

50:18.916 --> 50:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reclaim conversation that is
sacred place I call it a sacred
space at work

50:24.221 --> 50:28.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
conversation increases
productivity and yet people go
into work put on their

50:28.926 --> 50:32.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
headphones in one interview that
somebody called they become
pilots and

50:32.963 --> 50:37.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their own cock tits they put on
their phones they lay out their
phones they

50:37.334 --> 50:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put open up their computers and
they convinced themselves that
their most

50:41.505 --> 50:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
productive when they're focused
on your email when really
they're ignoring you

50:47.111 --> 50:51.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know the cafeteria the water
cooler than the meetings with
colleagues the times

50:51.248 --> 50:57.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when really they creativity
collaboration happens create
sacred

50:57.321 --> 51:01.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spaces in the workplace as well

51:01.158 --> 51:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classrooms five years ago
professors would say I don't
want to be in Dunedin

51:06.397 --> 51:10.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my students they can do whatever
they want no professors are
staying put away

51:10.501 --> 51:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that laptop because studies show
that it not only takes away the
attention of the

51:15.439 --> 51:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person who's on the laptop from
the class but everyone around
them is like a

51:18.909 --> 51:21.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circle around

51:21.111 --> 51:26.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that person thats distracted not
paying attention are you hopeful
I'm very

51:26.083 --> 51:31.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopeful young people realize
that something is amiss either
the generation

51:31.355 --> 51:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that fell in love with their
phones and it's very hard for
them to see that

51:35.359 --> 51:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a problem but young
people are desperate for the
attention of their

51:39.330 --> 51:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents who are really not
paying attention to them that's
one of the

51:43.100 --> 51:47.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surprises in the research that
it's not young people who were
sitting with their

51:47.938 --> 51:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phones if their parents who are
not paying attention to them and
teaching

51:51.442 --> 51:54.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them that behave yes and
teaching them that behavior

51:54.411 --> 51:56.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
alright the new book is
reclaiming conversation the

doesn't mean you'll be out of

52:17.301 --> 52:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
