31:19.881 --> 31:20.876
THE BOTTOM OF THAT LADDER       
VERSUS THE TOP OF THE LADDER    
THAT IS MORE CONSEQUENCE        

31:20.878 --> 31:22.238
VERSUS THE TOP OF THE LADDER    
THAT IS MORE CONSEQUENCE        
TODAY THAN IT WAS IN THE        

31:22.240 --> 31:23.932
THAT IS MORE CONSEQUENCE        
TODAY THAN IT WAS IN THE        
PAST, PRECISELY BECAUSE THE     

31:23.934 --> 31:25.494
TODAY THAN IT WAS IN THE

SO IF YOU ARE BORN TO           

31:26.326 --> 31:27.354
LADDER IS NOW EXPANDED.         
SO IF YOU ARE BORN TO

31:35.529 --> 31:36.623
A MUCH BIGGER GAP TODAY THAN    
2 IT WAS 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO.    
SO THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE       

31:36.625 --> 31:38.019
2 IT WAS 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO.    
SO THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE       
FACT THAT WE HAVE RELATIVELY

FACT THAT WE HAVE RELATIVELY    
LOW LEVELS OF MOBILITY IN

FACT THAT WE HAVE RELATIVELY    
LOW LEVELS OF MOBILITY IN       
THE U.S. ARE MUCH MORE          

31:41.643 --> 31:42.571
LOW LEVELS OF MOBILITY IN       
THE U.S. ARE MUCH MORE          
SERIOUS TODAY THAN THEY WERE

SERIOUS TODAY THAN THEY WERE    
IN THE PAST.                    
AND SO WE SHOULD BE MORE        

31:44.434 --> 31:45.794
IN THE PAST.                    
AND SO WE SHOULD BE MORE
