JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
arrived in Paris today for
talks with French President

00:04.066 --> 00:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emmanuel Macron, with the aim
of strengthening the alliance
between the two countries.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the visit was at least
partly overshadowed by questions
that continues to dog President

00:15.966 --> 00:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, whether his presidential
campaign coordinated with
the Russian government.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

00:22.266 --> 00:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Even amid
the splendor of Paris,
President Trump could
not escape the firestorm

00:29.033 --> 00:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over his son's meeting
with a Russian lawyer.

00:31.433 --> 00:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a news conference with French
President Emmanuel Macron,
Mr. Trump defended Donald

00:37.866 --> 00:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump Jr. as a wonderful young
man who did nothing wrong.

00:40.933 --> 00:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I think, from
a practical standpoint, most

00:44.000 --> 00:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people would have
taken that meeting.

00:46.566 --> 00:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called opposition
research, or even research
into your opponent.

00:49.933 --> 00:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have had many people -- I
have only been in politics
for two years, but I have had

00:54.533 --> 00:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many people call up, oh, gee, we
have information on this factor
or this person or, frankly,

01:02.233 --> 01:03.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hillary.

01:03.366 --> 01:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's very standard
in politics.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president said
the Russian lawyer, Natalia
Veselnitskaya, had visited

01:08.766 --> 01:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress and he suggested her
U.S. visa had been approved by
Obama Attorney General Loretta

01:14.633 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lynch, not the State Department.

01:16.566 --> 01:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Late today, Lynch said she
had nothing to do with it.

01:20.033 --> 01:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Air Force One on the way to
Paris, Mr. Trump told reporters
that the Russia investigation

01:24.866 --> 01:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was only helping him.

01:27.333 --> 01:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It's making Trump stronger,
because my people and
the people that support
me, who are incredible

01:33.466 --> 01:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, those people are angry
because they feel it's being
unfair and a witch-hunt."

01:38.700 --> 01:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the news conference, a French
reporter asked the president
about his often-repeated

01:40.933 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign anecdote about a friend
who had told Mr. Trump that
the threat of Islamic terrorism

01:46.700 --> 01:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had ruined Paris.

01:47.966 --> 01:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I see
him like a month ago.

01:49.566 --> 01:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How was Paris this summer?

01:50.866 --> 01:51.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What?

01:51.866 --> 01:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't go to Paris.

01:52.866 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you kidding me?

01:53.866 --> 01:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's no longer Paris.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, he turned
it around to flatter his host.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know what?

02:00.266 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's going to be just
fine, because you have
a great president.

02:02.966 --> 02:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have somebody who's going
to run this country right.

02:05.233 --> 02:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I really have a feeling that
you're going have a very, very
peaceful and beautiful Paris.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm coming back.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You better do a
good job, please.

02:18.666 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, you're going
to make me look very bad.

02:21.066 --> 02:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The two leaders
said they discussed Syria and
the fight against terrorism.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Macron said Mr. Trump's
decision to withdraw
from the Paris climate
accord wouldn't affect

02:30.800 --> 02:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their relationship.

02:32.666 --> 02:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bloomberg News White House
correspondent Toluse Olorunnipa
is covering the trip.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, Bloomberg
News: They see the world in
very different ways, but they

02:39.433 --> 02:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have come to realize that
they can benefit from having a
positive relationship with one

02:44.100 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another, and that's what
we saw on display today.

02:46.333 --> 02:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Indeed, the
body language today
was a marked difference
from their first awkward

02:53.266 --> 02:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encounter in May, and
was capped tonight with
dinner at the Eiffel Tower.

02:58.533 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After watching Bastille Day
celebrations in Paris tomorrow,
Mr. Trump heads back to the

03:01.566 --> 03:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
United States, and more
repercussions from his
son's Russia meeting.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Chuck Grassley said
he wants Donald Trump Jr. to

03:10.633 --> 03:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testify in open session
as soon as next week.
