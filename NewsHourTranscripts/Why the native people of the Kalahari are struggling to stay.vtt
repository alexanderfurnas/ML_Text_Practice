WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now we
travel to Botswana in Southern
Africa to meet a tribe who are

00:04.066 --> 00:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting their government
to retain the right to live
on their ancestral lands.

00:08.466 --> 00:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were forced off in
part because their lands
are rich with diamonds.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Martin
Seemungal has our story.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Their clothes
are modern, but their tools
of the hunt are thousands

00:20.700 --> 00:22.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of years old.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San bushmen still use the
spear and the bow and arrow.

00:29.266 --> 00:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Botswana's enormous Central
Kalahari Game Reserve is their
home, and one of the last

00:36.266 --> 00:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places on the planet where
you can find bushmen who still
hunt and gather to survive.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San have been tracking
like this for generations.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Technically, it's illegal,
because the government
has banned hunting inside
the Central Kalahari

00:48.200 --> 00:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Game Reserve, but some
of them do it anyway.

00:51.233 --> 00:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it's very
difficult to stop because
it defines who they are.

00:55.833 --> 01:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tolme Etata's first memories
are of hunting this land.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"If we stop hunting, our culture
would be affected," he says.

01:05.233 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"Hunting and gathering
is part of us."

01:12.166 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Though it is part of them,
it is not part of the plan
for the Central Kalahari Game

01:14.933 --> 01:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Reserve, as Botswana's
government sees it.

01:18.333 --> 01:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San bushmen's way of life
and culture are under threat.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their struggle to remain here,
in a place originally set
aside for them in the 1960s,

01:30.400 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes back to a major discovery
in the 1980s: diamonds.

01:36.733 --> 01:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the mid-1990s, the hunt for
precious stones in vast open pit
mines like this meant eviction

01:42.333 --> 01:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the reserve for
the hunter-gatherers.

01:45.333 --> 01:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mohulude Moete says it was done
by soldiers and military police.

01:50.166 --> 01:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says: "We were given
instructions: If you
don't get into the
truck, we will shoot you.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of our water containers
were emptied into the ground.

01:59.633 --> 02:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had no options, so we had to
go along with them or be shot."

02:07.066 --> 02:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These women were young
when the authorities came
for them, but say the
memories are unforgettable.

02:09.466 --> 02:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MUDIKOLELO LEMTODI,
Removed Person: All the
houses were destroyed.

02:11.966 --> 02:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Houses that they used
their energies to
built were destroyed.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL:
Wells were sealed up.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In spite of that, small
numbers refused to leave.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there were more evictions,
another big one in 2002.

02:25.766 --> 02:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government denied any
connection between the evictions
and diamonds in the Central

02:31.500 --> 02:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kalahari Game Reserve.

02:33.533 --> 02:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said the bushmen were
being moved out to protect
the wildlife in the reserve.

02:39.433 --> 02:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Botswana's president at
the time was Festus Mogae.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Will you let the
bushmen go home, Mr. Mogae?

02:43.066 --> 02:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FESTUS MOGAE, President of
Botswana: Where is home?

02:45.133 --> 02:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Home is in Botswana.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:47.133 --> 02:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: In the CKGR.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will you let them go home?

02:49.133 --> 02:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FESTUS MOGAE: No, no.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The semi-arid
Kalahari Desert is a harsh
place, but it's livable, if you

02:53.333 --> 02:56.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know where to gather,
along with the hunt.

02:56.500 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether its roots buried deep
in the sandy soil or wild
melons worth a day's water, all

03:06.533 --> 03:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their sparse
world is put to work.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Traditional huts comes
from the desert brush.

03:12.300 --> 03:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Onjustice Xothelo says two
days' work will last a decade.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The roof is a type
of grassy thatch.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ONJUSTICE XOTHELO, San Bushman:
The thatching grass on top
won't allow even water to get

03:25.733 --> 03:27.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: But the
government wanted fewer bushmen
staying in, and the evictions

03:29.900 --> 03:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from this land continued
for nearly 10 years.

03:33.733 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bushmen were relocated
to new settlements.

03:36.933 --> 03:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one is called New
Xade, named for the village
they were forced to leave.

03:41.666 --> 03:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Xade is just 50 miles from
the Kalahari, but it might
as well be 5,000 miles away.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Officially, nobody
is allowed to return.

03:51.133 --> 03:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, some have
tried to recreate life in the
villages, but they say it's just

03:56.766 --> 03:58.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not the same.

03:58.666 --> 04:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find those traditional
huts among the small
government-built houses.

04:02.366 --> 04:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Building the structures here
is a reminder to us that we
had these huts in Kalahari,"

04:07.833 --> 04:08.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he says.

04:08.766 --> 04:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"But our ancestors aren't here.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We build them to
remind us what we had."

04:13.233 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Xade has good roads, a
modern clinic and a school.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But beyond government-related
jobs, there is little else.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm looking
for a job, a job.

04:23.533 --> 04:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Right.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing to do here?

04:26.600 --> 04:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Yes, we have nothing
to do, so, dying for
hunger, looking for job.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: There is a
small mountain of beer cans
outside the one building that

04:37.066 --> 04:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does do big business:
the local bar.

04:45.866 --> 04:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alcohol abuse is rampant,
leading some to criticize the
government for creating these

04:51.966 --> 04:54.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relocated towns.

04:54.433 --> 04:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Survival International, an
agency that works to protect
indigenous people, has been the

04:59.033 --> 05:01.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most vocal.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A spokesperson with survival
says, it is clear that it
is not a viable way of life.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is not based on choice.

05:08.633 --> 05:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It deprives people of
their meaning, their
sense of well-being.

05:13.233 --> 05:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Survival helped the
bushmen in Botswana's
courts, a proposition
that ended up winning

05:17.666 --> 05:19.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2006.

05:19.566 --> 05:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The high court ruled the bushmen
had been removed unfairly
and should be allowed to

05:24.266 --> 05:26.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

05:26.333 --> 05:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the government decided
it would read the court
ruling very selectively.

05:30.033 --> 05:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only bushmen who'd brought the
suit would be allowed to return.

05:34.433 --> 05:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosetayani Matsipane was there
for the court case and heard
the judges' ruling, and could

05:40.266 --> 05:42.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten years later, he is
the leader of Motlomelo,
one of a handful of
small bushmen settlements

05:47.233 --> 05:49.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the reserve.

05:49.266 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government says
it is working with the
villages to restore some
basic services, like

05:54.400 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
access to water.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It also wants to focus
on community-based
tourism projects.

06:00.333 --> 06:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matsipane is happy to be out
of New Xade, but he doesn't
think the government's attitude

06:05.866 --> 06:07.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has changed.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He believes they still want
him out of the reserve.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"I continually get
pressure," he says.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The government has been doing
the same thing as before.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I would rather
they take my dead body.

06:19.266 --> 06:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I won't go back."

06:21.166 --> 06:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His wife, Hakanyaziwe, says
this is where she belongs.

06:27.833 --> 06:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"What's important to me
is the fruit of the land
in Kalahari," she says.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"In the resettlement camps,
everything is about money.

06:35.166 --> 06:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you don't have money, people
end up stealing to survive."

06:42.400 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Maitseo Bolaane
is the director of the San
Research Center, a small office

06:47.133 --> 06:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the University of
Botswana in Gaborone.

06:50.033 --> 06:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She believes the San people
are a resource that can be used
for the good of the Kalahari

06:56.300 --> 06:57.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reserve.

06:57.866 --> 06:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAITSEO BOLAANE,
Director, San Research
Center: They have ideas.

06:59.833 --> 07:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can contribute their
knowledge system in the
utilization of the resources.

07:05.266 --> 07:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Inside the
CKGR, those small communities
hold on, numbers dwindling every

07:10.333 --> 07:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year, living in the hope that
others will be able to return.

07:14.233 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, it is only them,
dancing in the desert
under the Kalahari stars.

07:21.133 --> 07:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "NewsHour,"
I'm Martin Seemungal in
the Central Kalahari.
