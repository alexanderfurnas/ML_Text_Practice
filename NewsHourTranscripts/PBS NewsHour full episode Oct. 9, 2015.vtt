It looks like we're retreating i

11:18.378 --> 11:22.348
behind this is two judgments by

politically to get rid of Bashar

11:29.255 --> 11:32.191

Obviously, we have made that one
Russia is making a different jud

in terms of the Syrian conflict,

there's a military course of act

11:52.445 --> 11:55.281
the situation better at an accep
or at an acceptable level of ris

11:56.749 --> 11:58.751
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're saying
doesn't have an approach yet? Is

11:59.319 --> 11:59.085
you're saying?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.156
P.J. CROWLEY: The administration
a military approach to Syria. It

12:03.923 --> 12:05.925
military approach to Iraq.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.263
But the reality here -- and I li
little bit to the Bosnia experie

JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kramer, why
a good option now?

12:34.387 --> 12:39.359
DAVID KRAMER: We have had 250,00
people killed. We have half of S

We have just let this problem fe
only gotten worse with time.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.524
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about th
-- P.J. Crowley, you were going

13:12.992 --> 13:15.495
P.J. CROWLEY: I agree with every
David just said, but it doesn't

to a clear position, unless we'r
to insert ourselves into an Iraq

13:24.203 --> 13:27.473
to take control of the situation
and try to impose a solution.

13:28.941 --> 13:34.447
And, as we saw in Iraq, that has
significant, you know, unintende

13:35.915 --> 13:37.417
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Kramer,
that? There is the real worry if

13:38.718 --> 13:40.353
gets involved, it gets sucked in
in, and can't get out.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.424
DAVID KRAMER: The Turks had indi
time ago that they were prepared

13:45.491 --> 13:47.393
in if the United States provided
support.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.198
So, we should create safe zones.
create no-fly zones. We should e

13:53.666 --> 13:56.169
for any planes that would threat
in those areas, whether they're

13:57.637 --> 14:00.339
or Russian planes. We should giv
full notice that any violations

14:01.808 --> 14:04.610
on those zones would constitute
that we would have to respond to

14:06.079 --> 14:08.548
Nobody wants this. There are bad
that have to be made here, but t

14:10.016 --> 14:12.685
we are right now. And I think un
that, we will continue to see pe

14:14.153 --> 14:17.223
we will continue to see people f
so there aren't any good solutio

14:18.091 --> 14:18.458
to find the least worst options.

14:19.926 --> 14:23.196
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my question i
an entire new level of risk, U.S

14:24.664 --> 14:31.337
shot down, U.S. troops get poten
not to mention a conflict, poten

14:32.138 --> 14:32.338
with Russia, unintentional?

14:33.806 --> 14:35.942
DAVID KRAMER: We have the Turks
indicated a willingness to go ah

14:37.410 --> 14:39.679
have other countries, including
although they're not great contr

14:40.413 --> 14:41.414
this kind of operation.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.385
The United States could provide
to provide the cover that way. I

14:47.854 --> 14:51.290
is a way of doing this without p
forces on the ground, but there

14:51.924 --> 14:52.258
good options here.

14:53.459 --> 14:56.829
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why isn't that on
that could work?

14:58.297 --> 15:01.868
P.J. CROWLEY: Well, safe zones a
approach, but it involves a deci

15:03.336 --> 15:08.608

has its own set of circumstances

15:09.408 --> 15:09.609
what the United States is...

15:10.676 --> 15:11.010
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's the bigges
to that?

15:12.044 --> 15:13.646
P.J. CROWLEY: Well, it's a very
space.

15:15.114 --> 15:19.218
We see situations now where, you
planes, in doing what they're do

15:20.686 --> 15:24.857
over into, you know, Turkish air
one thing we need to avoid above

15:26.325 --> 15:31.397
else is making a Syrian civil wa
conflict between the United Stat

15:32.765 --> 15:34.367
We didn't want to do that in Ukr
want to do that in Syria.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.572
So, I think the Obama administra
decided, right or wrong, that th

15:41.040 --> 15:45.011
a military solution to the situa
that has materialized yet, and s

15:46.479 --> 15:50.249
patience. As David said, that is
the Syrian people, but the Unite

15:51.717 --> 15:55.521
the meantime is focused on what
is its vital interest, defeating

15:56.155 --> 15:56.088
the Islamic State.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what are the
you have about doing that? What

16:02.094 --> 16:04.530

But I have a sort of counterintu

If you look at the polls and you
want there to be a government sh

24:40.612 --> 24:41.347
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

24:42.815 --> 24:47.319
Judy, there's historical precede
a parallel. In 1996, Bob Dole wa

24:48.787 --> 24:51.357
for the Republican presidential
had a long and distinguished car

24:52.825 --> 24:57.930
Senate majority leader. And beca
behavior and the chaos at the ti

24:59.398 --> 25:02.935
by the House Republicans led by
and closing down the federal gov

25:03.769 --> 25:05.003
Dole had to distance himself.

25:06.472 --> 25:10.576
He resigned from the Senate and
majority leader to say, look, I

25:11.677 --> 25:14.113
with these guys. I'm surgically
from them.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.316
And if you're a presidential can
they say, OK, you are going to g

25:18.784 --> 25:21.320

going to deal with, these are th

25:22.788 --> 25:27.025

as a conservative are unimpeacha
great strength of Nancy Pelosi a

25:46.578 --> 25:50.416
when she was speaker -- and she
speaker -- was that she could go

25:51.884 --> 25:56.255
in her own caucus, especially wo
on the health care, and say, you

25:57.723 --> 26:01.627
to come and compromise on this,
Latino members, you're going to

26:02.494 --> 26:03.862
on this, because her credentials

He could do that.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.436
JUDY WOODRUFF: You believe that
the conservative members of the

go along with raising the debt c

26:17.643 --> 26:23.182
MARK SHIELDS: I think his creden
are strong and believable, that

26:24.550 --> 26:27.186
them to the point where we have
our cause and advance it.

26:28.654 --> 26:32.024
I just -- I think that's the one
he brings that Boehner and McCar

26:33.492 --> 26:35.961
were doubts about them, because
as they might be to you and me,

26:36.829 --> 26:37.663
not conservative enough for the

JUDY WOODRUFF: You agree with th

DAVID BROOKS: Well, Boehner's no

26:42.601 --> 26:42.367
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.571
DAVID BROOKS: But, first of all,
Ryan doesn't do it. I believe pe

26:47.039 --> 26:48.407

I am even looking on my e-mail t

JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about

27:14.299 --> 27:17.569
The Democrats have their first d

to talk to Secretary Clinton thi

And she made news, David, by spl
the president on the new trade a

27:31.917 --> 27:35.721
the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a
of other moves she seems to be m

27:37.022 --> 27:39.858
left. Is this a smart move for h
or not-so-smart move?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.996
DAVID BROOKS: Well, she was unde
so, you know, so she had to choo

27:44.429 --> 27:44.329
heels.

27:44.830 --> 27:44.730
(LAUGHTER)

27:45.597 --> 27:47.299
DAVID BROOKS: I think it's crazy

27:48.767 --> 27:52.905
She has talked in favor of the T
in public. She calls it the gold

27:54.373 --> 27:57.543
of trade agreements. I think she
she actually believes about it a

27:59.011 --> 28:02.214
flipping for political expedienc
it buys you something on policy

28:03.682 --> 28:06.285
you don't have an argument with
in your first debate on trade, a

28:07.019 --> 28:07.920
difficult for Democrats.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.623
But her main problem and the way
in my view, is not how you stand

28:13.091 --> 28:17.095
that agreement. It's on characte
her main doubts, the doubts abou

28:18.564 --> 28:22.868
about authenticity and trustwort
flip-flopping this nakedly doesn

28:23.302 --> 28:23.068
help.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.538
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, she sa
changing her mind, that she didn

-- she never really committed on
and now that she's looked at it,

28:31.410 --> 28:31.610
think it's the right thing to do

MARK SHIELDS: When somebody appe

That's what it is. So, it's in t

mean by that?

39:49.120 --> 39:49.287
LINDA TROPP: Yes.

39:50.755 --> 39:55.927
If we think about the types of b
manifestations of anxiety, thing

39:57.395 --> 40:02.233
less eye contact, shifting away,
farther back, or maintaining gre

40:03.701 --> 40:06.904
distance, all of those might be
due to racial anxiety, but, in a

40:08.373 --> 40:11.376
they might be interpreted by the
or the person you're interacting

40:12.110 --> 40:12.644
hostility or rejection.

40:13.711 --> 40:14.579
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But why
anxiety?

40:16.047 --> 40:18.583
LINDA TROPP: I think in part bec
of our focus has been on reducin

40:20.051 --> 40:23.921
and we haven't focused as much o
people with the skills to actual

40:25.390 --> 40:28.493
cross-group intersections succes
with ease and comfort and confid

40:29.961 --> 40:32.764
And I think what often happens i
feel anxious, we kind of shut do

40:34.232 --> 40:37.402
a little more likely to depend o
for how we perceive people and h

40:38.870 --> 40:42.273
to people. So, if we give people
for real engagement across group

40:43.608 --> 40:45.843
these need to be repeated action
just be one experience.

40:47.312 --> 40:50.882
And often for those folks who sa
and it went terribly, I try to r

40:52.350 --> 40:54.752
when you first try to learn how
you don't know how to hold the r

40:56.220 --> 40:59.157
When you're first learning a lan
not automatically fluent, that t

41:00.625 --> 41:03.428
take time to cultivate, and that
we actually engage meaningfully

41:04.896 --> 41:07.699
boundaries, the greater facility
doing so, the greater ease and c

41:08.232 --> 41:07.999
experience.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.571
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How do y
as a part of this whole equation

41:14.405 --> 41:15.039
LINDA TROPP: Yes, absolutely.

41:16.507 --> 41:18.843
Well, fear, especially from the

I can understand completely how

41:25.183 --> 41:29.520
be fear. And, you know, talking
about the manifestation of fear,

41:30.988 --> 41:35.693
this sense that members of the b
are not part of the community th

41:36.561 --> 41:37.395
are designed to serve and protec

41:38.863 --> 41:41.933
There is the sense of separation
considered a perpetrator of crim

41:43.401 --> 41:48.606
part of the public that should b

41:50.074 --> 41:52.310
From the white perspective, I th
a lot of fear, especially when y

41:53.778 --> 41:57.548
white police officers in black c
I think there has perhaps been a

41:58.783 --> 42:02.887
distance between the police forc
of the community.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.125
So, I would be a strong advocate
policing, where you actually spe

42:08.593 --> 42:11.429
in the neighborhoods, getting to
getting a sense of how people re

42:12.530 --> 42:13.564
helping them see that you're not
a threat.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.870
And you can think about this, ho

42:20.338 --> 42:23.574
you only interacted with a roman
when you have to fight about som

42:24.609 --> 42:26.077
relationship is probably not goi
well.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.182
If you have many other varied ty
to build, you know, a relationsh

42:32.650 --> 42:36.220
interactions, you're likely to c
baseline or a foundation of trus

42:37.688 --> 42:40.124
when conflicts come to the surfa
more willing to give the benefit

42:41.292 --> 42:42.460
you're more willing to entertain
perspectives.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.730
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What do
of the discourse, though, as it'

42:46.864 --> 42:48.466
in the country today? It just se
cacophonous.

42:49.100 --> 42:49.434
LINDA TROPP: Yes.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.304
It's hard because there are so m
messages. And I think people are

42:54.772 --> 42:57.608
selective in which media outlets
more attention to and regard as

42:59.076 --> 43:02.146

groups or entities in those situ
they have valid experiences and

43:09.520 --> 43:11.823
And I think, rather than necessa
sound bites going back and forth

43:13.291 --> 43:17.995
of this broader cacophony that y
that we should try to understand

43:19.464 --> 43:21.966
do people feel that way, get a l
deeper in our analysis and under

43:23.100 --> 43:24.068
group lines, because I think tha
a long way.

43:25.536 --> 43:28.673
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Who has
responsibility, do you think, fo

43:29.540 --> 43:30.942
dialogue about race and racism?

43:31.576 --> 43:32.510
LINDA TROPP: Yes.

43:33.978 --> 43:39.684
You know, I think people on all
a bit of responsibility to take.

43:41.152 --> 43:46.090
in particular, white people need
concerned about how they will be

43:47.358 --> 43:49.961
and really more focused on learn
others' perspective.

43:51.429 --> 43:54.065
And I think to the extent that t
with integrity and the best of i

as we were describing before, I
of color will be receptive to th

43:59.003 --> 43:59.837
more willing to engage in conver

44:01.305 --> 44:05.510
And I say I focus on the respons
whites first because I think, of

44:06.978 --> 44:09.046
people of color, or black people
will complain about feeling like

44:10.515 --> 44:14.118
to educate white people, and it
And especially in these types of

44:15.586 --> 44:19.123
where race enters your life on a
basis, to have to say, yes, race

44:19.991 --> 44:21.425
seems a bit tiring, a bit taxing

44:22.894 --> 44:25.696
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, if y
situation like we have in this c

44:27.164 --> 44:31.435
where, as I said, we don't talk
as much as we talk about the pro

44:32.136 --> 44:33.237
do you get past that?

44:34.705 --> 44:36.607
LINDA TROPP: I think multifacete
are usually the most important.

44:38.075 --> 44:41.078
To share a little bit of the wor
my colleagues have done focusing

44:42.547 --> 44:46.417
between groups, actually giving
for real, meaningful, close inte

44:47.885 --> 44:51.355
group boundaries, and what that
not only tends to reduce prejudi

44:52.757 --> 44:54.792
helps to reduce our anxieties ab
interactions in the future.

44:56.260 --> 45:00.131
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Finally,
be said that it is always darkes

45:01.599 --> 45:05.269
dawn, and then, during my genera
always darkest just before it ge

45:07.038 --> 45:10.675
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Where do
this analysis of the future of r

45:11.275 --> 45:11.442
in this country?

45:12.910 --> 45:16.013
LINDA TROPP: You know, some of m
will tease me, but I try to be h

45:17.481 --> 45:21.552
And at the very least, the way I
is, I think, on some level, ther

45:23.020 --> 45:28.225
always be biases between groups.
what's the alternative? If we do

45:29.694 --> 45:34.565
fight for greater integration, g
justice, then those entities and

45:36.033 --> 45:38.235
try to pull groups apart will on
stronger. So, that's kind of whe

45:38.703 --> 45:38.536
myself.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.905
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: It sound
to me.

45:41.772 --> 45:42.440
LINDA TROPP: We got to do what w
