00:20.220 --> 00:26.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then, we are on the ground in Mosul, as the
battle to control the key Iraqi city rages

00:26.360 --> 00:27.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

JANE FERGUSON: The front line is just up here.

00:29.796 --> 00:34.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's where the River Tigris is, and ISIS
fighters are trying to push the Iraqi army

00:34.768 --> 00:35.669 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

JUDY WOODRUFF: The first two weeks of the
Trump presidency are now behind us, punctuated

01:03.230 --> 01:07.167 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by a push to begin to deregulate the financial
industry.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
John Yang reports on this day's events.

01:10.070 --> 01:16.743 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: At the first meeting of this new

01:16.843 --> 01:18.445 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
used touted his plans for progress.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:We're bringing back jobs.

01:20.547 --> 01:21.448 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're bringing down your taxes.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.983 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
We're getting rid of your regulations.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think it's going to be some really very
exciting times ahead.

01:26.586 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: The group talked banking rules
and tax reform.

01:31.558 --> 01:35.629 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But some also raised concerns that Mr. Trump's
immigration order would hurt their foreign

01:35.729 --> 01:38.131 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
employees and the economy.

01:38.231 --> 01:41.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

Channel.

01:44.571 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CEO, Blackstone Group:
General Kelly, who runs Homeland Security,

01:49.242 --> 01:54.881 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was there and brought people up to date onthe changes that had been made.

01:54.982 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there was obviously concern by different
people and explanations.

02:00.954 --> 02:06.927 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And that issue had to be covered and was covered.

02:07.027 --> 02:11.498 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Even before the first meeting,
Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick quit

02:11.598 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the group over the issue.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.203 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
He had been pressed by both workers and customers.

02:16.303 --> 02:21.074 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He wrote to employees: "We will continue to
advocate for just change on immigration, but

02:21.174 --> 02:24.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
staying on the council was going to get in
the way of that."

02:24.244 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The same kind of pressure is driving a nationalboycott of Trump products.

02:29.850 --> 02:36.023 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Retailer Nordstrom is dropping Ivanka Trump'sfashion line, citing poor sales.

actions to 20.

02:39.226 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Today, we're signing core principles
for regulating the United States financial

02:44.664 --> 02:45.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Doesn't get much bigger than that, right?

02:47.567 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: That executive order directed the
Treasury Department to look for ways to roll

02:51.772 --> 02:54.975 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
back the Dodd-Frank Act's regulations.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The 2010 legislation was in response to the
financial crisis.

02:58.578 --> 03:02.416 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was intended rein in big banks and protect
consumers.

03:02.516 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president also signed a memorandum aimed
at blocking a retirement savings regulation

03:07.521 --> 03:10.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
called the fiduciary rule.

making brokers put clients' interests first

03:14.995 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
when recommending investments for retirement
planning.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.669 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Administration officials call it a solution
in search of a problem, and the financial

03:22.769 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
industry has strongly opposed it.

03:25.806 --> 03:30.343 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Republican Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri
championed efforts to stop the regulation.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:32.279 --> 03:36.149 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ANN WAGNER (R), Missouri: Taking the boot
off the neck of the American people and this

03:36.249 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economy moving forward.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
People are crying out to cut the red tape.

03:40.320 --> 03:47.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are finished with the Washington knows
best, top-down bureaucratic regulation that

03:47.427 --> 03:50.263 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
is absolutely suffocating American families.

03:50.363 --> 03:55.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump capped the second week
of his presidency by heading to Florida for

03:55.102 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

03:58.805 --> 04:03.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On his way back to the White House on Monday,
Mr. Trump will spend his first major event

04:03.710 --> 04:05.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
addressing troops.

04:05.345 --> 04:09.583 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He will be at Central Command at MacDill AirForce Base on Tampa Bay -- Judy.

04:09.683 --> 04:13.720 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, a lot going on at
the White House this week, right up until

04:13.820 --> 04:15.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway
in a situation where she had to retract a

04:19.326 --> 04:20.994 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
statement she made in an interview yesterday.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.698 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She talked to Chris Matthews on MSNBC last
night.

04:24.798 --> 04:29.903 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She was defending the president's immigration
order and she said that the media never reported

04:30.003 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Bowling Green massacre.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.042 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Well, one of the reasons the media never reportedit is because it never happened.

04:36.143 --> 04:42.582 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today, she acknowledged on Twitter that she
had confused it with the arrest of two Iraqi

04:42.682 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- Iraqis who had been radicalized in Bowling
Green, Kentucky.

04:47.921 --> 04:52.492 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She apologized, but she also complained aboutbeing criticized for her slip.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, you mentioned Twitter.

04:54.427 --> 04:58.765 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president has continued to be active on
Twitter, this morning tweeting again about

04:58.865 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that phone conversation that he had, reportedly
heated conversation, with the prime minister

05:04.538 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Australia, and then another one about,
of all people, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will take them in order.

05:11.411 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The prime minister of Australia said that
the phone call was candid and frank, which,

05:16.783 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of course, is diplomatic language often for
a shouting match.

05:20.720 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he did say that, contrary to reports,
that Mr. Trump didn't hang up on him.

05:26.059 --> 05:31.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, Mr. Trump thanked him for straightening
that out and called the original reports fake

05:31.131 --> 05:32.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.336 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then on Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was
a little back and forth yesterday from the

05:36.436 --> 05:40.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Prayer Breakfast, when he talked about the
ratings.

05:40.373 --> 05:45.378 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mr. Schwarzenegger replied that maybe they
wanted to switch jobs, that Mr. Trump was

05:45.478 --> 05:49.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
better at ratings and that he was -- Americans
could sleep at night.

05:49.916 --> 05:54.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He said, yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a
really bad job as governor of California and

05:54.955 --> 05:58.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
even worse on "The Apprentice," but at least
he tried hard.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.161 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sounds like that settles
that.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:02.996 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang, after another busy
week at the White House, thank you.

06:07.500 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And in the day's other news: January's job
creation was the best since last September.

06:12.305 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Labor Department reports that U.S. employers
added 227,000 new jobs.

06:17.811 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.8 percent.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.985 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Now, that is more Americans looking for work.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
President Trump welcomed the report and said
that it shows a -- quote -- "great spirit"

06:28.922 --> 06:30.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

06:30.757 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The jobs report and the president's move to
scale back financial regulations fueled a

06:34.561 --> 06:36.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rally on Wall Street.

06:36.363 --> 06:41.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 186
points to close back above 20000.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.573 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Nasdaq rose 30, and the S&amp;P 500 added
16.

06:46.673 --> 06:53.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Trump administration imposed new economic
sanctions today on 13 people and a dozen companies

06:53.113 --> 06:54.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Iran.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.785 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is a response to Iran's test this month
of a ballistic missile.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Early this morning, the president tweeted:--
quote -- "Iran is playing with fire."

07:03.623 --> 07:08.862 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president
isn't ruling out other responses, including

07:08.962 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
military action.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary:
These sanctions today I think are going to

07:11.998 --> 07:15.835 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
be very, very strong and impactful.

07:15.935 --> 07:20.340 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I hope that Iran realizes that, after
the provocative measures that they have taken,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that they understand that this president,
this administration is not going to sit back

07:24.144 --> 07:25.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and take it lightly.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later in the day, when Mr.
Trump was asked about Iran, he said -- quote

07:28.648 --> 07:30.383 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- "They're not behaving."

07:30.483 --> 07:36.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif,
posted his own tweet, saying -- quote -- "Iran

07:36.189 --> 07:37.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unmoved by threats.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will never initiate war."

07:39.959 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will get into the details of these sanctions,
and the implications, after the news summary.

07:45.432 --> 07:51.604 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Paris, security fears surged again today
when a man with a machete attacked guards

07:51.705 --> 07:54.207 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
outside the famed Louvre museum.

07:54.307 --> 07:59.646 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The attacker, said to be an Egyptian national,
shouted "God is great" in Arabic.

07:59.746 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He slightly injured one soldier before beingshot and wounded himself.

08:04.517 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Museum-goers had to run away or shelter in
place.

08:13.393 --> 08:19.399 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In it, the Trump White House says they don't
impede peace, but that constructing new ones

08:19.499 --> 08:23.737 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or expanding existing ones -- quote -- "may
not be helpful."

08:23.837 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In response, Israel's deputy foreign minister
said today: "The conclusion is that more building

08:29.376 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not the problem."

08:31.311 --> 08:36.583 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas called for action to prevent settlement

08:36.683 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expansion.

08:38.551 --> 08:43.890 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reassured
South Korea and Japan today that the U.S.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.059 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
is still committed to defending them.

08:46.159 --> 08:51.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His first trip abroad followed candidate Trump's
complaints that the allies should do more

08:51.331 --> 08:53.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their own defense.

08:53.199 --> 08:58.605 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Seoul, Mattis met with his South Korean
counterpart, and he underscored American support

08:58.705 --> 09:00.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to deter North Korea.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.676 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of Defense: America's
commitments to defending our allies and to

09:03.777 --> 09:08.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
upholding our extended deterrence guarantees
remain ironclad.

09:08.915 --> 09:14.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Any attack on the United States or on our
allies will be defeated and any use of nuclear

09:14.521 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
weapons would be met with a response that
would be effective and overwhelming.

09:19.192 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mattis later met with Japan's
prime minister in Tokyo.

09:23.329 --> 09:30.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The U.S. has more than 28,000 troops in SouthKorea and about 50,000 in Japan.

security forces in Myanmar of mass killings

09:36.509 --> 09:39.846 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and gang rapes against Rohingya Muslims.

A report today charges that there's a campaign
to drive them out of the mostly Buddhist nation.

09:45.752 --> 09:51.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Myanmar has denied previous allegations of
abuses against its Muslim minority.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.394 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It says it is battling insurgents.

09:54.494 --> 09:59.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Back in this country, a Justice Department
lawyer told a federal court today that 100,000

10:00.066 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
entry visas have been revoked under PresidentTrump's immigration order.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The State Department said later that the numberis actually fewer than 60,000.

10:08.842 --> 10:15.081 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Meanwhile, federal judges in Boston, Seattle
and Virginia held hearings on legal challenges

10:15.181 --> 10:16.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the order.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.252 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So far, at this hour, there's been a split
in rulings.

10:19.352 --> 10:25.425 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Boston judge declined to extend the partial
block on the Trump order, while, in Virginia,

10:25.525 --> 10:29.829 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a judge allowed a lawsuit challenge to go
forward.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The stage is set now for a Senate showdown
on Betsy DeVos.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She is President Trump's nominee to be secretary
of education.

10:37.904 --> 10:43.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Senators voted early this morning to end debate,
with Democrats and Republicans senators jousting

10:43.710 --> 10:44.911 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
over the nominee's qualifications.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader: The
nominee for the secretary of education is

10:48.715 --> 10:55.622 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
one of the worst nominees that has ever been
brought before this body for a Cabinet position.

10:55.722 --> 11:00.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On the grounds of competence, on the grounds
of ideology and on the grounds of conflicts

11:00.927 --> 11:02.462 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
of interest, she scores very, very low.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.299 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), Tennessee: There will
be no mandates for Common Core, no mandates

11:06.399 --> 11:11.571 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
for teacher evaluation, no mandates for vouchers,
no mandates for anything else from the United

11:11.671 --> 11:14.541 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
States Department of Education headed by Betsy
DeVos.

11:14.641 --> 11:19.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will be swapping a national school board
for what she believes in, which is a local

11:19.712 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
school board.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The confirmation vote on DeVos
will come next week.

11:23.917 --> 11:29.556 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It could end in a tie, leaving Vice PresidentPence to cast the deciding vote.

11:29.656 --> 11:34.360 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Congressional Republicans are also moving
to rescind more Obama-era regulations.

11:34.460 --> 11:39.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The House voted today to abolish a rule on
cutting methane emissions from natural gas

11:39.799 --> 11:41.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drilling.

11:41.668 --> 11:45.805 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the Senate gave final approval to dropping
a mandate that energy firms disclose what

11:45.905 --> 11:48.308 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
they pay governments for drilling rights.

11:48.408 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are going to look at the drive to rollback rules later in the program.

11:52.645 --> 11:56.849 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Enrollments on the national Obamacare Website have fallen slightly.

11:56.950 --> 12:01.821 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The government reported today that 9.2 million
people signed up through the end of January.

12:01.921 --> 12:06.025 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's about half-a-million fewer than at
this point last year.

12:06.125 --> 12:12.165 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are no final numbers yet for the 11
states with their own health insurance markets.

12:12.265 --> 12:16.803 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Still to come on the "NewsHour": new sanctions
against Iran in response to a ballistic missile

12:16.903 --> 12:23.676 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
test; from Wall Street to the environment,
rolling back Obama-era regulations; the next

12:23.776 --> 12:37.857 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
phase of the battle for Mosul; and much more.

12:37.957 --> 12:42.695 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As we reported earlier, the Trump administration
applied new sanctions today to more than a

12:42.795 --> 12:48.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
dozen people and companies tied to Iran'sballistic missile program.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.936 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

12:50.036 --> 12:54.073 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White House says the
sanctions are not related to the nuclear deal,

12:54.173 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and structured in a way that maintains the
U.S.' commitments to that agreement.

12:58.678 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, the national security adviser,
Michael Flynn, also released a statement today,

13:02.815 --> 13:08.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
saying -- quote -- "The international community
has been too tolerant of Iran's bad behavior.

13:08.321 --> 13:13.059 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The ritual of convening a United Nations Security
Council in an emergency meeting and issuing

13:13.159 --> 13:15.662 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
a strong statement is not enough.

13:15.762 --> 13:21.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Trump administration will no longer tolerate
Iran's provocations that threaten our interests."

13:21.200 --> 13:25.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Joining me now for what the new sanctions
and statements mean going forward is Karim

13:25.471 --> 13:28.941 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace MD-BO .

13:29.042 --> 13:31.511 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Karim, let's start by putting this in context.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.814 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Who do these sanctions affect and what are
they going to be prohibited from doing?

13:34.914 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
KARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie Endowment For International
Peace: Hari, these sanctions are very targeted

13:37.717 --> 13:43.156 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
against individuals and entities that are
affiliated or part of Iran's Revolutionary

13:43.256 --> 13:52.331 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Guards, who are involved in Iran's missile
program and Iran's support for regional militias.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they're very targeted.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.137 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They're not broad sanctions which are intended
to really change Iranian behavior.

13:58.237 --> 14:02.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I do think they're intended to do what
General Flynn, the national security adviser,

14:02.442 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
said, which is to put Iran "on notice" -- quote,
unquote.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.649 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How different are they from
steps that perhaps the Obama administration

14:09.749 --> 14:14.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
would have taken had they seen this ballistic
missile test happen on their watch?

14:14.187 --> 14:19.559 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: You know, the Obama administration
was reluctant to sanction Iran and counter

14:19.659 --> 14:25.965 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
its regional behavior because they were very
worried that that would provoke an escalation

14:26.065 --> 14:30.737 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which would jeopardize the nuclear deal, which
was the Obama administration's main foreign

14:30.837 --> 14:32.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policy legacy.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the Trump administration doesn't have
those concerns.

14:35.842 --> 14:41.414 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
President Trump has routinely denounced theIran nuclear deal as a disaster.

14:41.514 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And I think, in contrast to the Obama administration,
the Trump administration's national security

14:46.886 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
brain trust, men like General Flynn, General
Mattis at the Pentagon, these were men who

14:51.991 --> 15:00.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
served in Iraq, and they hold Iran responsible
for the death of hundreds of U.S. soldiers.

15:00.733 --> 15:05.571 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so they felt, during the Obama years,
that they were restrained from being able

15:05.671 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to retaliate against Iran.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.344 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now they feel unrestrained and they'reconfronting Iran in the region.

15:11.444 --> 15:16.382 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Iran already this afternoon
said that they are planning to take similar

15:16.482 --> 15:21.554 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
steps against members inside the United States.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does this escalate?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does this go further?

15:24.557 --> 15:30.496 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: I do think, Hari, that we
are in the early stages of an escalation which

15:30.596 --> 15:36.002 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
could eventually, over months, culminate in
a military conflict either between the United

15:36.102 --> 15:39.305 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
States and Iran or Israel and Iran.

15:39.405 --> 15:46.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, Iran's comfort zone is to have kind of
managed, contained hostility between the United

15:46.345 --> 15:47.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States and Iran.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.484 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For four decades, that's been a central partof the revolutionary ideology.

15:51.584 --> 15:58.024 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But they have stopped short of actually going
into military conflict with the United States.

15:58.124 --> 16:02.829 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that the early weeks and months of
the Trump administration will be a time in

16:02.929 --> 16:06.899 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which both countries are kind of feeling the
other one out.

16:06.999 --> 16:13.873 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Iran, I expect, will want to show that these
sanctions and the taunts from Trump are not

16:13.973 --> 16:18.010 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
going to modify their behavior, but, at the
same time, they will probably want to respond

16:18.110 --> 16:21.614 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in a way which isn't going to significantly
escalate.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
They will want probably a gradual escalation.

16:23.983 --> 16:29.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is the end goal for both
sides here to see who will back out of the

16:29.355 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
deal first, or who will, at least in the international
community, lose face?

16:33.960 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: You know, that's absolutely
right, that neither side will want to gratuitously

16:40.566 --> 16:44.203 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
tear up the nuclear deal and be blamed for
it.

16:44.303 --> 16:50.409 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I think that one of the things the Obama administration
did well is that they made the case to countries

16:50.509 --> 16:56.182 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like China, Russia, America's European allies
that America tried to engage Iran, Iran didn't

16:56.282 --> 16:59.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
reciprocate, and the problem lied in Tehran,
not Washington.

16:59.652 --> 17:04.290 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think the challenge the Trump administration
will have is that you have a president in

17:04.390 --> 17:10.263 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Washington who is gratuitously blusterous,
not only toward America's adversaries, but

17:10.363 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also America's allies.

17:12.164 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, at the same time, you have in Tehran
a president, Hassan Rouhani, and a foreign

17:17.303 --> 17:24.911 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
minister, Javad Zarif, who in much of the
world seems like moderates, reasonable figures.

17:25.011 --> 17:29.749 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And add on to the fact that the Middle East
is in the throes of tumult and carnage.

17:29.849 --> 17:35.021 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And for many countries around the world, including
China, Russia and Europe, they see Iran as

17:35.121 --> 17:39.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a force for stability in the region and an
ally against ISIS.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Karim Sadjadpour,
thanks so much.

17:42.695 --> 17:48.901 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Thank you, Hari.

17:49.001 --> 17:57.677 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we're going to dig into
some of the actions taken this week by the

17:57.777 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
White House and the Congress to roll backObama era rules and regulations.

18:02.949 --> 18:07.019 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am joined by our own Lisa Desjardins and
William Brangham.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.020 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we welcome both of you.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It's good to have you here at the table.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.657 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
William, I'm going to start with you.

18:11.757 --> 18:17.830 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We heard John Yang reporting earlier the administration
did today go after financial regulations that

18:17.930 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
were part -- a feature of the Obama administration,including a peace of Dodd-Frank.

18:23.869 --> 18:24.770 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
&nbsp;
Tell us about that.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.709 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today was what some people would say was the
beginning of an all-out rollback.

18:29.809 --> 18:33.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some would argue it's a dismantling of consumer
protections and financial regulations.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.949 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
With regards to Dodd-Frank, this order that
the president put out doesn't mention Dodd-Frank

18:37.049 --> 18:42.955 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
by name, but it's all about Dodd-Frank, Dodd-Frank,
as you remember, the 2010 law that said we

18:43.055 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
need to fix some of the problems that got
us into trouble in 2008, how banks operate,

18:47.660 --> 18:48.828 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the risks story can take.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They created the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau.

18:52.031 --> 18:56.769 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Critics have hated Dodd-Frank and all of its
tentacles ever since it was created.

18:56.869 --> 19:01.240 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now the president has asked the secretary
of the treasury to look at all the different

19:01.340 --> 19:05.644 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rules within there, find out which are too
costly, which are too burdensome and potentially

19:05.745 --> 19:07.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get rid of them.

19:07.613 --> 19:12.585 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Supporters of Dodd-Frank would say maybe the
law wasn't perfect, but something had to be

19:12.685 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
done to constrain Wall Street since the 2008
crisis, so we don't see a repeat, and that

19:17.923 --> 19:19.725 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
this move goes in the opposite direction.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.129 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the other thing they did
which I think is important is they went after

19:23.229 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a provision that -- again, feature of the
Obama administration -- that affects those

19:28.467 --> 19:31.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
individuals who are paid to give retirement
financial advice.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This is what was known -- this was the rulesthe Department of Labor put out.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.277 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
It's called the fiduciary standard.

19:38.377 --> 19:42.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And last year, the Department of Labor said
any financial adviser or broker has to follow

19:43.082 --> 19:47.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
this standard, which means you have to put
your clients' interests ahead of your own,

19:47.720 --> 19:52.358 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and not sell them a package that might kick
back fees to you or might not be very good

19:52.458 --> 19:54.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for them as a client.

19:54.326 --> 19:59.298 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Again, the industry for a long time has said
this is burdensome, costly, it stops people

19:59.398 --> 20:01.734 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
from getting good financial advice.

20:01.834 --> 20:06.806 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And today the memorandum that the Trump administration
put out said, Department of Labor, look at

20:06.906 --> 20:09.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
these rules, figure out which ones we should
get rid of.

20:09.708 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Again, the supporters of these rules argue
that roughly $17 billion every single year

20:15.714 --> 20:20.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is lost by people who are given unscrupulous
advice and encouraging a dismantling of these

20:20.519 --> 20:22.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rules is a terrible idea.

20:22.321 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's certainly something
we want to continue to pay attention to.

20:26.358 --> 20:33.165 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, Lisa, meantime, Congress moving in its
own way to roll back some important actions

20:33.265 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
during the Obama administration.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of them had to do withcoal mining and waterways.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.406 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Tell us about that one.

20:40.506 --> 20:44.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, Congress now is using
a very seldom-used law that allows them to

20:44.310 --> 20:48.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
go after rules that were passed in the last
months of the Obama administration.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.851 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the first one is this one, the stream
protection rule.

20:51.951 --> 20:56.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what that does is, it requires mining
companies to monitor streams for pollution

20:56.355 --> 21:01.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and then it tells them exactly what quality
those streams must meet, or else mining companies

21:01.927 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
must fix the problem.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Republicans have moved this week in Congress
to roll that back.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.602 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That legislation is going to President Trump's
desk.

21:09.702 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now critics of that rule say the problem
was twofold, too onerous on the companies

21:14.640 --> 21:18.410 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and that it was poorly written, that it affected
Great Plains the same way as it did the mining

21:18.511 --> 21:21.113 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
companies in West Virginia that it was really
aimed at.

21:21.213 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But supporters point out that, according to
those who wrote this rule, it would have improved

21:26.652 --> 21:28.387 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
thousands of miles of streams.

21:28.487 --> 21:32.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the other thing we know
Congress is working on, hot-button topic,

21:32.625 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
guns and the access that people who may have
disabilities, and whether they have access.

21:39.165 --> 21:42.101 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is another big deal,
something that the House passed yesterday.

21:42.201 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They would roll back a rule that had to do
with a 2007 law that came out of the Virginia

21:47.973 --> 21:49.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tech massacre.

21:49.508 --> 21:52.611 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was aimed at trying to prevent the mentally
ill from obtaining guns.

21:52.711 --> 21:57.016 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, what this rule does is, it takes those
who are on Social Security disability and

21:57.116 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who have been found to be mentally impaired,
puts those names into the national background

22:02.588 --> 22:06.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
check system, so they would be prevented from
buying guns.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Critics -- the Republican critics of that
law say it's a problem because it's an overreach.

22:10.129 --> 22:14.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It would include anyone who doesn't take care
of their own finances.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Democrats say it's about safety.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Listen to just this split on the House floor
yesterday.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JACKIE WALORSKI (R), Indiana: If you receive
Social Security disability payments and someone

22:22.942 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
helps you manage the payments, this regulation
stops you from being able to purchase a firearm.

22:29.048 --> 22:34.386 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Your name gets added to a federal database,
and the burden is on you to prove it doesn't

22:34.486 --> 22:35.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
belong there.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is absolutely outrageous.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY CHU (R), California: This will not only
make it easier for even those with severe

22:41.927 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
mental health issues to buy a gun, but it
will also take the option for writing similar

22:47.533 --> 22:53.072 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rules off the table forever, tying the handsof all future administrations.

22:53.172 --> 22:57.810 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, that reversal of thatgun rule now goes to the Senate.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
It's expected to pass.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.082 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, Judy, the thing I want to impress on
people is that because of this special law

23:03.182 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that they're using here, the House and Senate
can get these rollbacks through more quickly.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They only need a majority vote in the Senate,
not 60 votes.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.026 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are going to see a lot of these in coming
weeks.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, we're only two
weeks in.

23:15.761 --> 23:16.762 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.030 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Already, all this is happening.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.767 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Lisa Desjardins, William Brangham, we thank
you.

23:21.867 --> 23:32.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:32.578 --> 23:36.849 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze week two of the Trump

23:36.949 --> 23:43.689 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
administration; a stark film about race in
America told through James Baldwin's unfinished

23:43.789 --> 23:51.897 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
novel; and a Muslim Marine who tells people
to ask him anything.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But first: the battle for Mosul.

23:54.066 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The months-long siege by Iraqi forces, with
U.S. support, has taken back about half the

24:00.105 --> 24:01.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

24:02.007 --> 24:05.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Signs of life are returning to those areas,
while a new offensive is in the works to capture

24:05.978 --> 24:08.447 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the rest from ISIS control.

24:08.547 --> 24:13.752 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Special correspondent Jane Ferguson and videographer
Alessandro Pavone have our report.

24:13.852 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: Weaving through recaptured
streets of Eastern Mosul, Colonel Nazar Naji

24:18.524 --> 24:22.728 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
takes us to the Iraqi army outposts under
his command.

24:22.828 --> 24:27.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His men are positioned on rooftops, watching
for any signs of ISIS fighters coming across

24:27.966 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the Tigris River that flows through the city.

24:30.903 --> 24:36.342 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Recently, he tells me, around 50 fighters
managed to cross and attack this position.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NAZAR NAJI, Iraqi Army (through translator):
They have been trying to break into the eastern

24:39.878 --> 24:42.648 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
side of the city, because they are now surrounded
on the West side.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are besieged by the Iraqi army, militias
and police.

24:45.751 --> 24:50.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: Since the campaign to drive
ISIS out of Mosul began nearly four months

24:50.622 --> 24:56.362 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ago, Iraqi forces, backed by U.S. air support
and special forces, have retaken the eastern

24:56.462 --> 24:59.231 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
side of the city up to the river.

24:59.331 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The western side is now completely surrounded,
and ISIS is under siege.

25:04.770 --> 25:09.274 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An Iraqi military offensive to retake the
rest of the city is expected to start at any

25:09.375 --> 25:11.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

25:11.276 --> 25:16.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Meanwhile, ISIS sharpshooters are still killing
soldiers on the government-controlled side.

25:16.882 --> 25:25.557 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Because of ISIS snipers just across the river,
we need to use these trucks as protection.

25:25.657 --> 25:30.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These neighborhoods were recaptured by Iraq's
U.S.- trained special forces after brutal

25:30.662 --> 25:33.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighting.

25:33.832 --> 25:37.736 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's now up to the regular Iraqi army to try
to hold the line.

25:37.836 --> 25:43.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Colonel Naji hears on the radio a position
nearby is coming under heavy fire, and he

25:43.642 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
races there to lead his soldiers.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.251 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Backup arrives with heavy weaponry.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

25:54.186 --> 26:03.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NAZAR NAJI (through translator): There is
an attack by ISIS, and the Humvees are going

26:03.695 --> 26:04.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to support them.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.698 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
There is only one injury, God willing.

26:06.799 --> 26:11.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: For these men, the fear is
that this attack is only to distract them

26:11.770 --> 26:15.607 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
while ISIS sneaks fighters across the river.

26:15.707 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The front line is just up here.

26:20.646 --> 26:25.551 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's where the River Tigris is, and ISIS
fighters are trying to push the Iraqi army

26:25.651 --> 26:26.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

26:26.752 --> 26:32.691 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Nearby, the unit responds with mortars.

26:32.791 --> 26:37.796 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The one casualty, a soldier hit in the head
with some shrapnel, is patched up and raced

26:37.896 --> 26:42.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
away from the front line.

26:42.768 --> 26:49.541 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But just a short distance away, a remarkable
sight: Mosul's streets are again vibrant.

26:49.641 --> 26:52.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Life has returned to areas recaptured from
ISIS.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.847 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Even traffic jams are common.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Just weeks ago, these streets were deadly
battlegrounds.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.853 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Now shops and restaurants are open for business.

27:00.953 --> 27:07.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Open-air markets take place every day, packed
with people.

27:07.759 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Under ISIS, food shortages were severe and
prices crippling.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.534 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Getting food is now easier, but life is still
tough.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.905 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WOMAN (through translator): There is no water
and no electricity.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.474 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We are pumping water out of old wells.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's not clean.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.311 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
People can get very sick from it.

27:26.411 --> 27:30.949 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: The men at this tea stall are
relieved that their neighborhood is safe now,

27:31.049 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but they have other worries.

27:32.885 --> 27:36.021 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN (through translator): Education is also
so important.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For three years, our children have not gone
to school.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.526 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They are behind with their studies.

27:40.626 --> 27:48.367 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: That's changing for many children
in Eastern Mosul; 250 teenage boys attend

27:48.467 --> 27:50.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this school.

27:50.335 --> 27:56.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These young men would have been targeted for
recruitment into the ranks of ISIS fighters.

27:56.675 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These boys are so determined to be here, they
have come despite the lack of electricity

28:01.680 --> 28:04.349 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
and freezing temperatures in the classroom.

28:04.449 --> 28:08.820 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They haven't been in school for years, and
the teachers are delighted to see them.

28:08.921 --> 28:17.896 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: One hundred percent all the students
in this area love -- loving coming to school.

28:17.996 --> 28:21.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They excited to study.

28:21.300 --> 28:26.738 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: Iraqis still living on the
ISIS side of the river don't have that chance.

28:26.838 --> 28:29.875 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Hundreds of thousands of people are still
trapped there.

28:29.975 --> 28:34.846 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Sometimes, the brave risk their lives, making
a run for it.

28:34.947 --> 28:40.085 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Back at the riverside, the army unit has spotted
two men trying to cross a bridge nearby.

28:40.185 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
They move into position to watch for them.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Captain Amr Abdul Sadda tracks them as they
approach.

28:47.492 --> 28:50.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An armored Humvee is moved in front of the
bridge.

28:50.963 --> 28:55.167 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In these tense moments, the soldiers have
to determine whether the men approaching them

28:55.267 --> 28:59.104 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
are innocent civilians or suicide bombers.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This happens a lot, says the captain.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CAPT.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
AMR ABDUL SADDA, Iraqi Army (through translator):
Every day, we try to secure families trying

29:04.343 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to cross towards us, and give them covering
fire, because ISIS are using their snipers

29:07.846 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on them.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
JANE FERGUSON: They are scared?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CAPT.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMR ABDUL SADDA (through translator): The
people on the other side are afraid.

29:14.953 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But whenever they cross to us and we accept
them, we calm them down and tell them everything

29:18.690 --> 29:19.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is OK.

29:19.691 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We are the security forces.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.495 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are your brothers, and we are here to free
you.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.998 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JANE FERGUSON: Then they appear.

29:26.098 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have taken their clothes off to prove
they are not hiding weapons or explosives.

29:31.003 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Relieved, and still frightened, they have
survived a perilous escape from ISIS territory.

29:37.643 --> 29:41.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But they are part of a tiny trickle of people
making it out.

29:41.246 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The rest remain trapped on the other side
of this divided city.

29:45.717 --> 29:54.693 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane Ferguson
in Mosul, Iraq.

29:54.793 --> 30:02.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

30:02.401 --> 30:07.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields
and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

30:07.606 --> 30:08.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

30:08.607 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So much to talk about.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.611 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
David, week two of the Trump administration.

30:12.711 --> 30:17.849 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's start with his pick for the Supreme
Court, federal Judge Neil Gorsuch.

30:17.949 --> 30:19.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you make of him?

30:19.818 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Clearly qualified, first-rate
legal scholar, first-rate judge, first-rate

30:24.256 --> 30:26.925 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
mind, apparently a first-rate person.

30:27.025 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
He's what any -- the best any Republican president
would have done.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.998 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I thought a very good pick for Donald
Trump.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Democrats have a challenge.

30:35.133 --> 30:40.639 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They can either behave the way the Republicans
did to Merrick Garland, which would be disgraceful,

30:40.739 --> 30:42.741 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
but that would blow up the system.

30:42.841 --> 30:47.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have a loyalty either -- I think a primary
loyalty to the Constitution and basically

30:47.212 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
to the norms of how we have done justice constitutional
-- or justice confirmations for the past many

30:53.852 --> 30:55.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

30:55.721 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that is, if the president picks someone
who is basically qualified, basically a good

30:59.925 --> 31:03.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
person, then you confirm that person even
if you don't agree, because your side lost

31:03.762 --> 31:04.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.164 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Now, I understand the Democratic thinking.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.200 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The Republicans didn't behave this way.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.137 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I guess my belief is that two terrible
behaviors don't make a good behavior.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.673 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's your take on Judge Gorsuch?

31:14.773 --> 31:20.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, Judy, first of all, I
agree with David on the assessment of him.

31:20.812 --> 31:28.053 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He went to Georgetown Prep, which is a rather
exclusive local prep school, then on to Columbia

31:28.153 --> 31:31.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
College, and then to Harvard Law School, then
to Oxford.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the vice president made a point when he
was interviewed by you in this show, emphasizing

31:35.861 --> 31:40.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he's a fourth-generation Coloradan, because
his resume sounds very much like all the other

31:40.365 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
justices on the Supreme Court.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.003 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And as somebody who said that we ought to
have somebody on the court who went to night

31:45.103 --> 31:51.510 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
school or went to public school -- but, nevertheless,
he does seem by temperament -- and I will

31:51.610 --> 31:53.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say this.

31:53.445 --> 31:58.884 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In an administration that has been marked
by total chaos and is unsettling in the way

31:58.984 --> 32:06.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it's behaved and the impulses it's shown by
its president, this was the exception.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.060 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was incredibly normal.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They did it well.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The announcement was done well.

32:12.564 --> 32:16.968 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He's being -- the Sherpa he has on Capitol
Hill is former Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte

32:17.068 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of New Hampshire, who is well-respected with
moderates and Democrats, and Ron Bonjean,

32:22.407 --> 32:26.311 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
who was Trent Lott's adviser and spokesman.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.447 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: So, that's been well done.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.283 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And he seems to be a quality product.

32:31.383 --> 32:34.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you agree with David, atough call here for Democrats?

32:34.152 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: It's tough in the sense that,
I mean, the Republicans were reprehensible,

32:37.989 --> 32:41.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what they did to Merrick Garland, reprehensible,
indefensible.

32:41.326 --> 32:46.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They never even gave the man a hearing, aman with a distinguished career.

32:46.264 --> 32:47.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They ignored the Constitution.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The temptation is enormous.

32:49.734 --> 32:55.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The pressure is enormous from the Democratic
base of the party.

32:55.574 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And don't forget, I mean, the Republicans
responded to the Tea Party, which was the

32:59.311 --> 33:00.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base of their party.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I can understand that.

33:03.515 --> 33:09.354 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think that -- you know, I think, unless
there's something hidden about him that nobody

33:09.454 --> 33:14.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
seems to know and nobody seems to even be
suggesting, I think he's going to be awfully

33:14.492 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tough to defeat.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he's a quality nominee.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.597 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going to watch
that one unfold.

33:18.697 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I do want to get, David, to the executive
orders.

33:22.968 --> 33:26.471 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have been coming at us fast and furious
just about every day.

33:26.571 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the big one I want to ask you about is
the immigration order.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's created a firestorm.

33:31.977 --> 33:35.580 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We just -- we announced -- we just reported
a few minutes ago a couple of federal judges

33:35.680 --> 33:37.983 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
have ruled on it because of legal challenges.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.618 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
There have been protests.

33:39.718 --> 33:44.756 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You have got State Department employees whohave signed a letter of dissent.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.361 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is the administration getting off on the rightfoot or not with this statement?

33:49.461 --> 33:55.500 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you know, I have been
inundated by 18 inches of orders, like we

33:55.600 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
all have over the last couple of weeks, and
some of them are good.

33:58.403 --> 34:01.172 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think some of them are completely toothless
and symbolic.

34:01.273 --> 34:06.211 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But this one on the refuges is the one that's
truly abominable and reprehensible.

34:06.311 --> 34:11.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We can't remind people enough that it responds
to a problem that does not exist, that refugees

34:11.616 --> 34:14.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in from these countries have killed no one
in a terrorist attack.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That's not where the threat has lain.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.088 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It's from homegrown people.

34:17.188 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It's maybe from other countries.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.626 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The 9/11 people were from Saudi Arabia and
some other places.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.695 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And so it's a response to nothing.

34:23.795 --> 34:29.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so you have to think that it's just an
outgrowth of nativism.

34:29.200 --> 34:33.171 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there has been a whiff of nativism, to
put it politely, in a lot of the measures

34:33.271 --> 34:35.407 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that this administration has done.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it has offended our career people in the
State Department.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.045 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It has offended our allies.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It has offended a lot of people around theworld, for no good effect.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Usually, when there's some policy, there are
pros and cons.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.385 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
There are literally no pros to this one.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Any good effect?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.755 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No good effect.

34:50.855 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And both the president and his vice president
made the mistake of referring to it as a ban,

34:55.427 --> 34:58.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
then tried to -- Muslim ban -- then tried
to walk it back.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

35:00.598 --> 35:04.769 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, Judy, the irony is, in a week where the
president says he wants to unleash churches

35:04.869 --> 35:09.808 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
politically from being hobbled, and goes to
the National Prayer Breakfast, I mean, forgotten

35:09.908 --> 35:16.581 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is the message of Christ, that -- how youtreat the stranger among you.

35:16.681 --> 35:24.356 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Whatever you do for the least of these, that
of Moses, that you shall not oppress an alien,

35:24.456 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
because you yourselves have been aliens.

35:26.191 --> 35:30.161 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This has been the hallmark, this has been
the defining value of the United States.

35:30.261 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We had six Nobel Prize winners American last
year.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All six were immigrants.

35:36.001 --> 35:42.107 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Immigrants have been the sustenance and the
survival and the treasure of this country.

35:42.207 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Donald Trump is appealing, as he did during
the campaign, to the basest, the most selfish

35:47.979 --> 35:52.650 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
and the most literally un-American of instincts.

35:52.751 --> 35:56.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, I wanted to ask you
about foreign policy, but I have to come back

35:56.321 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to what you were just saying, an outgrowth
of nativism.

35:59.924 --> 36:04.863 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You wrote a very tough column this week, saying
this is not just a Republican administration;

36:04.963 --> 36:07.165 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
it's an ethnic nationalist administration.

36:07.265 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You talked about Republicans making a Faustian
bargain to go along with Donald Trump.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a pretty dark picture, isn't it, that
you have painted?

36:15.373 --> 36:16.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.976 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And I just think they're in an untenable position.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Listen, I grew up with Ronald Reagan.

36:20.478 --> 36:23.114 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he's one of the reasons I think it was
very encouraging to be a conservative back

36:23.214 --> 36:24.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in those days.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he had a refugee crisis when he first
came into office from Cambodia and Laos and

36:27.786 --> 36:28.753 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
other parts of the world.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And he said, we're going to welcome them.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he did welcome them.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.326 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that was a Republican Party that did welcome
the refugee because it basically believed

36:35.427 --> 36:36.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in opportunity.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It believed in possibility.

36:38.329 --> 36:40.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a hopeful party.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not a hopeful party.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It doesn't believe in opportunity and -- it
does see possibility anywhere around the world.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It sees threat and menace.

36:47.772 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, frankly, it reminds me of some of the
reactionaries in Russia who think that the

36:51.543 --> 36:55.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
purity of the country is in the dark soul
of the people who have been here for centuries,

36:55.246 --> 36:56.781 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and everything outside is a threat.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.750 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That's not been the American myth.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.919 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's not the way we have defined our country.

37:01.019 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so I do think we're in the middle of a
big argument over how we define the American

37:05.056 --> 37:06.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

37:06.891 --> 37:10.895 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what Bannon and Trump have presented us
with is an idea of America that's not been

37:10.995 --> 37:14.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the traditional idea, not the Walt Whitman
idea, not the George Washington, Abraham Lincoln

37:14.966 --> 37:20.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
idea, which is one of welcoming because we'rethe last, best hope of Earth.

37:20.472 --> 37:24.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
And so we have hit the opposite of Emma Lazarus.

37:24.309 --> 37:29.180 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that debate about the American idea, seems
to me, the core debate under this whole administration.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.150 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, the opposite of Emma
Lazarus.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.685 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The opposite -- yes.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.889 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, Americans -- Americans have gone through
nativist streaks before.

37:37.989 --> 37:42.760 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Know-Nothings in the middle of the 19th
century were a dominant political influence

37:42.861 --> 37:48.333 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of many Northern states, held every seat in
the Massachusetts legislature, alarmed about

37:48.433 --> 37:52.704 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the influx of Irish immigrants and Catholics
coming into the country.

37:52.804 --> 38:01.646 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I do think that one major difference between
our handling of civil rights in the 1960s,

38:01.746 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
when America rose to one of its most magnificent
eras and challenges, and immigration in the

38:07.785 --> 38:13.958 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
21st century is the economy, I mean, that
the measure of our progress is not whether

38:14.058 --> 38:17.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we add more to the abundance of those who
have much, but whether, as Franklin Roosevelt

38:17.562 --> 38:20.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
said, we provide enough for those who have
too little.

38:20.298 --> 38:25.403 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And during the '60s, the median income was
doubling of the American household.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we have seen the stagnation.

38:27.071 --> 38:28.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen what has happened.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it comes at a cost.

38:30.308 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it comes at a cost in the psyche, that
Americans are less welcoming, we're more fearful.

38:37.782 --> 38:45.023 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I really think that income inequality
is -- and the disparity in income and the

38:45.123 --> 38:52.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
growing gap has contributed to that political
climate that Donald Trump has exploited so

38:52.730 --> 38:54.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
brilliantly.

38:54.666 --> 38:59.871 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and while we're watching
this immigration ban, or order, however you're

38:59.971 --> 39:05.777 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
describing it, David, we have also watched
a flurry of statements and tweets about foreign

39:05.877 --> 39:10.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
policy, and reported angry phone calls between
the president and the prime minister of Australia

39:11.082 --> 39:13.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the president of Mexico.

39:13.518 --> 39:18.389 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Today, the White House issued sanctions, heightened
sanctions against Iran.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.993 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There seems to be a consensus that that's
a good idea.

39:22.093 --> 39:27.865 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But do you see an emerging -- what do you
see emerging in terms of foreign policy from

39:27.966 --> 39:29.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this White House?

39:29.834 --> 39:33.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I have to say it has been an
extremely unnerving week on the foreign policy

39:33.771 --> 39:35.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
front.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.876 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The fight with the Australian ambassador -- or
with the Australian prime minister was emblematic.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trump is right at some level.

39:40.278 --> 39:42.547 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
That was a bad deal that the Obama administration
cut.

39:42.647 --> 39:43.915 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I understand why they cut it.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, for the Trump administration, it was
a bad deal.

39:46.584 --> 39:50.488 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But that doesn't mean you get in a fight and
get in some temperamental hissy fit, as apparently

39:50.588 --> 39:55.360 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
happened, with probably our most loyal ally
in the world, who's been with us at every

39:55.460 --> 39:58.162 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
fight basically throughout our history.

39:58.263 --> 40:01.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so that's a sign of characterological
problem.

40:01.532 --> 40:04.202 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then you switch to the real problems in
the world.

40:04.302 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We're not going to get in a war with Australia.

40:05.870 --> 40:09.073 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, as Steve Bannon said, we might get ina war in the South China Sea.

40:09.173 --> 40:12.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, as Mike Flynn said, we might get in a
war in Iran.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we have to be tough with those countries,
but you would like to feel there is some control

40:15.780 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in our toughness, that there's some strategy,
that we're not at the whim of one person's

40:20.051 --> 40:21.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pique.

40:21.886 --> 40:27.725 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so, when we even take what seem to be
sensible actions in Iran -- or against Iran,

40:27.825 --> 40:31.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have no confidence, and I don't think any
of us can have confidence, that there is something

40:31.663 --> 40:35.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
steady and temperamental and in control about
that.

40:35.533 --> 40:39.170 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, as I had mentioned on the program a few
weeks ago, the number of use of force decisions

40:39.270 --> 40:41.973 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the president has to take is large.

40:42.073 --> 40:46.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And none of us can be sure that the sane choices
will be made, let alone reasonable ones.

40:46.811 --> 40:51.149 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, in just a minute, how
are you seeing this emerging national security

40:51.249 --> 40:53.017 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
vision from this administration?

40:53.117 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, Judy, I mean, we want
a president with a steady hand on the tiller.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.590 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, that's what we want.

40:59.691 --> 41:03.828 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We want the captain who is -- who is stable,
who inspires confidence.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that has not been the case.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.534 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
This is the biggest betting week of the year.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.436 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
This is the Super Bowl week.

41:11.536 --> 41:16.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And anybody would have given -- would have
won a fortune on the over-under that the country

41:16.107 --> 41:19.344 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
you're going to pick an argument with is Australia.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
It just -- it's incredible.

41:21.145 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But it's all personal, because all politics
isn't local, as Tip O'Neill said.

41:24.649 --> 41:29.354 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
All politics is personal with President Trump.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.656 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that carries with it great, great problems.

41:31.756 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are just at the beginning.

41:34.992 --> 41:39.597 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we thank you both for your insights andwe hope you have a good weekend.

41:39.697 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

41:40.965 --> 41:54.011 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you.

41:54.112 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Next: James Baldwin was one of the nation's
most prominent authors, public speakers, social

42:01.052 --> 42:03.454 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
critics and civil rights activists.

42:03.554 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A new Oscar-nominated documentary opening
today explores his life and legacy.

42:09.394 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.331 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It's part of our series Beyond the Red Carpet.

42:13.431 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And a warning: It contains offensive language.

42:16.567 --> 42:24.809 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES BALDWIN, Author/Civil Rights Activist:
There are days -- this is one of them -- when

42:24.909 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you wonder what your role is in this countryand what your future is in it.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: His words never really went
away, but the writer James Baldwin, speaking

42:33.151 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
here on public television in 1963, feels as
relevant as ever.

42:38.156 --> 42:44.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES BALDWIN: I'm terrified at the moral
apathy, the death of the heart, which is happening

42:44.962 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in my country.

42:46.831 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These people have deluded themselves for so
long, that they really don't think I'm human.

42:53.571 --> 42:59.477 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NARRATOR: "The story of the Negro in America
is the story of America.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is not a pretty story."

43:01.679 --> 43:06.451 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The clip is from a new documentary
that draws a portrait of the artist, though

43:06.551 --> 43:11.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
not as a traditional film biography, and of
the fractured and racially divided world he

43:11.622 --> 43:13.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
shone a searing light on.

43:13.324 --> 43:16.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NARRATOR: "I was free only in battle, but
never free to rest."

43:16.961 --> 43:18.963 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's called "I Am Not Your
Negro."

43:19.063 --> 43:22.900 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK, Director, "I Am Not Your Negro":
James Baldwin is probably, for me and for

43:23.000 --> 43:29.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
many other people, one of the most extraordinary
authors in this country, black or white.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And he is somebody who changed my life.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.913 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Raoul Peck is best
known for documentaries and dramas about the

43:36.013 --> 43:43.120 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, and "Sometimes
in April" about the Rwandan genocide.

43:43.221 --> 43:47.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Born in Haiti and raised in the Congo, Peck
says that, for him, James Baldwin was an early

43:48.025 --> 43:52.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and abiding influence about how to see and
encounter the world.

43:52.263 --> 44:00.605 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: It gave, suddenly, an explanation
to feelings that I had towards racism, toward

44:00.705 --> 44:08.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
opportunities, toward politics and justice
and injustice, you know, a lot of things that,

44:09.080 --> 44:15.586 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as a young man, that you have, but because
there are not so many authors where you feel

44:15.686 --> 44:19.557 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
you are represented, or the same on cinema.

44:19.657 --> 44:24.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There were not so many films where you saw
your own narrative on the screen.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.863 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, that voice.

44:25.963 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: That voice, and to feel you belong.

44:28.566 --> 44:34.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Baldwin was born in Harlem
in 1924 and spent his youth there.

44:34.138 --> 44:38.042 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He later lived for years in France, where
he felt he could live more freely as a black

44:38.142 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gay man.

44:39.944 --> 44:44.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He became known for essays, such as "Notes
of a Native Son" and "The Fire Next Time,"

44:44.982 --> 44:50.488 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
novels including "Go Tell It on the Mountain"
and "Giovanni's Room," and much more, including

44:50.588 --> 44:53.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his role as a public commentator, debater
and witness.

44:53.791 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES BALDWIN: Again, like most white Americans
I have now encountered, they have no -- I'm

44:59.163 --> 45:00.965 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
sure they nothing whatever against Negroes.

45:01.065 --> 45:02.800 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's really not the question.

45:02.900 --> 45:06.237 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
No, the question is really a kind of apathy
and ignorance, which is a price we pay for

45:06.337 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
segregation.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.041 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's what segregation means, that you don't
know what's happening on the other side of

45:10.141 --> 45:11.943 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the world because you don't want to know.

45:12.043 --> 45:17.648 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NARRATOR: "I was in some way in those years,
without entirely realizing it, the great black

45:17.748 --> 45:19.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hope of the great white father."

45:19.884 --> 45:25.156 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film uses Baldwin's own
words and writings read by Samuel L. Jackson,

45:25.256 --> 45:31.362 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
particularly a short manuscript he never completed
about three men he'd known, all of them assassinated

45:31.462 --> 45:37.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
before the age of 40, Malcolm X, Medgar Evers,
and Martin Luther King.

45:37.935 --> 45:42.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As a film credit puts it, the film is, in
a sense, written by James Baldwin.

45:42.640 --> 45:50.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: So, my job is to find the book,
and to recreate it, and which is then the

45:50.715 --> 45:52.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
film for me.

45:52.516 --> 45:57.622 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That was, of course, the line and the storyline
that I needed to construct that film.

45:57.722 --> 45:59.190 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's interesting.

45:59.290 --> 46:02.360 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, to make the film that he set out to do,but wasn't able to finish.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: Yes, exactly.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Exactly.

46:05.329 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, that's why, as a filmmaker, I feel thatI was just the messenger.

46:09.066 --> 46:14.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I was just the person in charge to put it
together, but he already wrote it.

46:14.872 --> 46:21.545 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's why I was very proud to be able to
put "directed by Raoul Peck, but written by

46:21.646 --> 46:25.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
James Baldwin," because he wrote every single
word in the film.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't add anything.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.755 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I deconstructed, but I didn't -- wrote it.

46:30.855 --> 46:36.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES BALDWIN: What black people have to do
is try to find out in their own hearts why

46:36.260 --> 46:39.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it was necessary to have a nigger in the firstplace, because I'm not a nigger.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.765 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
I'm a man.

46:40.865 --> 46:44.568 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you
need it.

46:44.669 --> 46:49.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his film, though, Peck has
done what Baldwin, who died in 1987, could

46:49.573 --> 46:55.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
not: connect his time to ours through images
of Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, and more.

46:55.780 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: When I started 10 years ago to
work on this project, it was because I already

47:02.853 --> 47:05.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
felt that something was wrong.

47:05.322 --> 47:11.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was for us, you know, scary, because it
was actually something we were working on.

47:11.662 --> 47:15.032 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And now we have visual of that, images.

47:15.132 --> 47:22.973 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it made the film more urgent for us, but
it didn't really change the origin or the

47:23.074 --> 47:29.480 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
needs for this movie and the need to go back
to Baldwin, because Baldwin gave us the fundamentals.

47:29.580 --> 47:32.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NARRATOR: "Well, I am tired.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.885 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I don't know how it will come about.

47:34.985 --> 47:40.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I know that, no matter how it comes about,
it will be bloody.

47:40.791 --> 47:42.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will be hard.

47:42.593 --> 47:47.631 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I still believe that we can do with this country
something that has not been done before.

47:47.732 --> 47:52.970 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We are misled here because we think of numbers.

47:53.070 --> 47:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You don't need numbers.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You need passion.

47:56.974 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And this is proven by the history of the world."

48:00.010 --> 48:06.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAOUL PECK: He was already a classic, and
he wrote those things 40, 50 years ago.

48:06.817 --> 48:12.823 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And watching the film, you think that he would
have -- he wrote that in the morning, the

48:12.923 --> 48:17.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
morning before watching the film, becausethose words are so accurate.

48:18.028 --> 48:20.464 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are so prescient, you know?

48:20.564 --> 48:24.468 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
And so it back-fold, that you can do it better.

48:24.568 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: "I Am Not Your Negro" will
compete in the best documentary category at

48:29.039 --> 48:31.942 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the Academy Awards on February 26.

48:32.042 --> 48:40.217 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
From Washington, I'm Jeffrey Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

48:40.317 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mansoor Shams served in the
United States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2004.

48:51.228 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Recently, he has been traveling around the
country with a simple sign that reads: "I'm

48:56.700 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a Muslim and a U.S. Marine.

48:59.336 --> 49:01.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ask anything."

49:01.172 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
"NewsHour" producer Mike Fritz joined him
while he was on the streets of Baltimore to

49:04.508 --> 49:06.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
listen in to some of the conversations he
was having.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.346 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANSOOR SHAMS, Former U.S. Marine: Do you
know that I have to believe in Jesus Christ

49:09.446 --> 49:10.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in order to be a Muslim?

49:10.981 --> 49:12.316 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He's a very special person to us.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Oh, yes.

49:13.417 --> 49:14.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But he's more than a prophet.

49:14.552 --> 49:15.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MANSOOR SHAMS: But that's OK.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's where we differ.

49:17.121 --> 49:18.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Mansoor Shams.

49:19.023 --> 49:21.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a former U.S. Marine.

49:21.659 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I was born in Pakistan, came to the United
States at age 6.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm now 34 years old.

49:26.330 --> 49:30.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: So, how are you Muslim and a Marine if
they hate you?

49:30.401 --> 49:32.469 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MANSOOR SHAMS: Because that's what I am.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MAN: It doesn't make sense.

49:34.104 --> 49:36.440 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MANSOOR SHAMS: How did I start this project?

49:36.540 --> 49:40.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, it's interesting, because never would
I have thought that we would reach a state

49:40.611 --> 49:47.251 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in our nation where we would be troubled or
confused or frustrated or divisive when it

49:47.351 --> 49:49.854 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
came to people who followed my faith.

49:49.954 --> 49:52.089 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The more conversations that we have, the better.

49:52.189 --> 49:57.228 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Recently, I got to visit the cities of Houston,Denver, Portland, and Seattle.

49:57.328 --> 50:03.367 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's always a new experience in general, because
you don't know how people are going to react,

50:03.467 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and how they are going to take it.

50:07.538 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: ISIS, I thought they just chopped the
heads off.

50:12.243 --> 50:13.143 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They don't chop your head off.

50:13.244 --> 50:14.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They even have little children.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't even...

50:15.279 --> 50:16.146 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MANSOOR SHAMS: They're horrendous people.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I agree with you.

50:17.715 --> 50:19.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If ISIS caught me, they would put me -- break
me up into pieces.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some of the questions that I get as I'm outand about relate to Sharia law.

50:23.053 --> 50:24.822 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
That's a very big one.

50:24.922 --> 50:27.524 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, they will say, do you believe in Sharia
law as a United States Marine, as a Muslim?

50:27.625 --> 50:30.194 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Of course, my answer is, yes, I do.

50:30.294 --> 50:31.962 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But it's not the way that you believe in it.

50:32.062 --> 50:33.364 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It's the way I believe in it.

50:33.464 --> 50:36.333 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I tell them that it's literally a path to
life-giving water.

50:36.433 --> 50:37.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a moral code.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.236 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It tells me not to commit adultery.

50:39.336 --> 50:40.271 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It tells me not to fornicate.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.673 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It tells me not to drink, not to gamble.

50:42.773 --> 50:44.575 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This is all forms of Sharia law.

50:44.675 --> 50:49.213 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A lot of people are scared of perhaps people
who follow my belief system or even look like...

50:49.313 --> 50:50.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I love Muslims.

50:50.314 --> 50:51.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love everybody, brother.

50:51.315 --> 50:52.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love you.

50:52.316 --> 50:53.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MANSOOR SHAMS: Hey, man.

50:53.317 --> 50:54.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, man.

50:54.318 --> 50:55.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You motivate me, man.

50:55.319 --> 50:56.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:56.654 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
MANSOOR SHAMS: I think Americans do not understand
Islam.

50:57.855 --> 51:00.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's been among -- amongst America for 200
years.

51:00.257 --> 51:01.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's always been there.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: And, see, that's what he's trying to
protect us from is the radical Muslim, the

51:03.360 --> 51:11.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ones that are intending to come over here
and kill us.

51:11.101 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MANSOOR SHAMS: In the larger scheme of things,
when you paint an entire religion or an entire

51:17.174 --> 51:20.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
nation, for that matter, with a broad brush,
and anyone who is an immigrant who's come

51:20.878 --> 51:25.049 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to this country, ask them how hard it is to
come to this country.

51:25.149 --> 51:26.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

51:26.617 --> 51:28.352 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My feelings of Donald Trump, or President
Trump, has been mixed.

51:28.452 --> 51:34.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's helped me to see another America thatI thought we had gone far past.

51:34.224 --> 51:39.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
However, I did take the time to write him
a letter and to say that he could use me as

51:39.263 --> 51:40.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a potential resource.

51:40.297 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I don't know if he's received it.

51:43.233 --> 51:44.234 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It wasn't a partisan letter.

51:44.335 --> 51:46.437 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It wasn't a negative letter.

51:46.537 --> 51:51.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It wasn't not a not-my-president letter, because
not my president technically goes against

51:51.542 --> 51:53.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my faith as well.

51:53.377 --> 51:57.881 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Koran teaches me to be loyal, not only
loyal, but to obey people in authority above

51:57.982 --> 51:59.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

51:59.283 --> 52:02.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He is our president, and there's no doubt
about that.

52:02.553 --> 52:05.422 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Everybody met a Muslim and a U.S. Marine?

52:05.522 --> 52:09.360 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I feel that, at the end of the day, if we
don't fix these things, this is going to have

52:09.460 --> 52:11.562 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
a -- create a larger problem for our country.

52:11.662 --> 52:15.632 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The trajectory we're headed on right now doesn'tseem like a very good one.

52:15.733 --> 52:16.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're not that different.

52:16.734 --> 52:17.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
MAN: That's right.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.036 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MANSOOR SHAMS: No need to be scared.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Right.

52:21.105 --> 52:24.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MANSOOR SHAMS: You know?

52:25.042 --> 52:28.946 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A news update now.

52:29.046 --> 52:34.585 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Just moments ago, a federal judge in Seattle
granted a temporary halt to President Trump's

52:34.685 --> 52:36.587 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
order to restrict immigration.

52:36.687 --> 52:39.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The ruling applies nationwide.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.925 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Tune in tonight on "Washington Week."

52:42.026 --> 52:47.598 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A reporters roundtable examines President
Trump's world view and the world's view of

52:47.698 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

52:49.633 --> 52:54.571 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
On "PBS NewsHour" Saturday, special correspondent
Nick Schifrin meets up with armed citizens

52:54.671 --> 52:58.242 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
on patrol along the U.S. border with Mexico.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a look.

53:00.210 --> 53:02.913 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Tim Foley likes to describe
himself and his men as a kind of neighborhood

53:03.013 --> 53:04.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
watch.

53:04.948 --> 53:08.018 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the last seven years, the 57-year-old
former Army soldier, firefighter, and construction

53:08.118 --> 53:10.687 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
worker has led the Arizona border recon.

53:10.788 --> 53:14.658 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Foley describes it as a surveillance group,
but members are armed with military-style

53:14.758 --> 53:16.493 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
rifles that are legal in Arizona.

53:16.593 --> 53:18.695 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TIM FOLEY, Arizona Border Recon: When the
friends come to your house, they come to the

53:18.796 --> 53:20.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
front door and ring the bell and announce
themselves.

53:20.631 --> 53:23.901 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This desert land is a well-wornroute for Mexican cartels.

53:24.001 --> 53:29.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TIM FOLEY: Basically, what we're trying to
do is just hurt the cartels' pocketbook.

53:29.740 --> 53:33.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This area is pretty much theirs, and we're
coming back in and going, it's not yours.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's ours.

53:35.145 --> 53:38.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That is tomorrow night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:39.083 --> 53:40.717 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And that's the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:40.818 --> 53:41.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:41.819 --> 53:43.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:43.120 --> 53:47.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, and good night.
