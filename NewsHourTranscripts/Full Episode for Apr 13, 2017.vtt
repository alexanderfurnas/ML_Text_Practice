JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.507 --> 00:11.511 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The Trump administrationfaces several crises overseas.

00:11.611 --> 00:16.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We examine America abroad and the international
challenges facing the new president.

00:17.050 --> 00:23.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then, we return to Mexico, strengthening its
southern border against Central Americans

00:23.423 --> 00:26.059 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
fleeing north to escape violence and poverty.

00:26.159 --> 00:30.030 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There's a private security
company that prevents migrants from getting

00:30.130 --> 00:34.467 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on the train, and they have built these concrete
barriers just a few inches from the edge of

00:34.567 --> 00:35.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the train.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The idea is to make it much more dangerous
to jump from the train.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.175 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And learning history through
song.

00:42.275 --> 00:48.581 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
High school students compose a choral history
lesson about World War II Japanese American

00:48.681 --> 00:50.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
internment camps.

00:50.550 --> 00:55.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAS YAMASHITA, Held in Internment Camp: It's
my hope that people can really look at this

00:55.822 --> 01:00.860 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as saying, we can't isolate a group of people
just for who they are.

01:00.960 --> 01:08.935 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.035 --> 01:11.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.871 --> 01:22.449 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. military blasted Islamic
State fighters in Afghanistan today with the

01:22.549 --> 01:26.152 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
biggest non-nuclear bomb in the American arsenal.

01:26.252 --> 01:31.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The target was a tunnel complex in Nangarhar
province near the Pakistani border.

01:31.925 --> 01:38.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The bomb contains 11 tons of explosives, and
had never been used in actual combat.

01:38.631 --> 01:42.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
President Trump said it shows the U.S. istaking the fight to ISIS.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
If you look at what's happened over last eight

01:45.505 --> 01:50.910 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
weeks and compare that to really what's happened
over the last eight years, you will see there's

01:51.010 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a tremendous difference.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tremendous difference.

01:54.180 --> 01:58.551 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just last week, a U.S. Army
special forces soldier was killed in the same

01:58.651 --> 02:01.754 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
area where the bomb was dropped.

02:01.855 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is out with
a fresh denial of any role in a poison gas

02:07.360 --> 02:11.698 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
attack which last week killed 87 people, including
children.

02:11.798 --> 02:17.237 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The U.S. responded a few days later with a
cruise missile strike on a Syrian military

02:17.337 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
air base.

02:19.272 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Assad spoke with Agence France-Presse and
said he would agree to an impartial investigation.

02:23.376 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of Syria (through
translator): We don't have any chemical weapons.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.349 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We gave up our arsenal a few years ago.

02:29.449 --> 02:36.990 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Even if we have them, we wouldn't use them,
and we have never used our chemical arsenal

02:37.090 --> 02:38.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our history.

02:39.092 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our impression is that the West, mainly the
United States, is hand in glove with the terrorists.

02:44.631 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They fabricated the whole story in order tohave a pretext for the attack.

02:49.269 --> 02:54.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the Syrian army
claims that the U.S. coalition hit an Islamic

02:54.607 --> 02:59.746 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
State chemical weapons warehouse last nightand killed hundreds of people.

02:59.846 --> 03:05.885 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Separately, the Pentagon acknowledged another
strike in Syria mistakenly killed 18 rebels

03:05.985 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who were battling ISIS.

03:07.954 --> 03:12.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The European Court of Human Rights ruled today
that the Russian government used excessive

03:12.992 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
force in reacting to a school siege back in
2004.

03:17.397 --> 03:22.602 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
More than 330 people died in the southern
Russian city of Beslan.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
About half were children.

03:24.571 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Heavily armed Islamic militants associated
with the Chechen Republic stormed the school,

03:30.076 --> 03:32.712 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
triggering a nearly three-day stand-off.

03:32.812 --> 03:37.217 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Russian forces used tanks and grenade launchers
to end the siege.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Moscow vowed to appeal today's ruling.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Back in this country, President Trump signed
legislation that lets states deny federal

03:46.025 --> 03:47.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
funds to Planned Parenthood.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It also includes other groups that provide
abortions.

03:51.197 --> 03:56.869 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The action rescinds an Obama era rule that
said states could not block the money.

03:56.970 --> 04:01.541 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, on Wall Street, it followed financial
stocks lower today.

04:01.641 --> 04:07.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138points to close at 20453.

04:07.247 --> 04:13.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Nasdaq fell 31, and the S&amp;P 500 gave up
16.

04:13.353 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Still to come on the "NewsHour": the international
challenges facing the Trump administration;

04:18.758 --> 04:26.132 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
changing course, the president's shifting
views on domestic policies; the deported -- Mexico

04:26.232 --> 04:40.380 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
secures its own border; and much more.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.251 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The last week has seen significant changes
in the way the Trump White House views the

04:45.351 --> 04:47.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

04:47.220 --> 04:51.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what began as a presidency emphasizing
retrenchment on the home front has been quickly

04:51.357 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
refocused on the U.S. role abroad.

04:53.593 --> 04:57.030 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
USA!

04:57.130 --> 04:58.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
USA!

04:58.998 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He bills himself the America
first president, but it's world affairs that

05:01.701 --> 05:04.737 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
have risen to the top of his agenda lately.

05:04.837 --> 05:10.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Syria's use of chemical weapons, the U.S.
response, and President Trump's own words

05:10.376 --> 05:13.179 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have raised fresh questions about his foreign
policy.

05:13.279 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: Right now, the world is a mess.

05:16.783 --> 05:21.154 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think, by the time we finish, I think
it's going to be a lot better place to live.

05:21.254 --> 05:26.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still, on Syria, for one example,there are competing messages.

05:26.392 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Defense Secretary James Mattis said Tuesday
the priority remains defeating the Islamic

05:31.731 --> 05:37.937 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
State, and not removing President Bashar al-Assad,
despite last week's poison gas attack.

05:38.037 --> 05:41.474 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of Defense: This
was a separate issue that arose in the midst

05:41.574 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of that campaign, the use by the Assad regime
of chemical weapons, and we addressed that

05:49.649 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
militarily.

05:51.551 --> 05:55.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Mr. Trump sounded a harsher
note yesterday, calling Assad an animal, and

05:55.555 --> 05:56.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
worse.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DONALD TRUMP: That's a butcher.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a butcher.

05:59.726 --> 06:04.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The issue dominated Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson's tense visit to Moscow

06:04.630 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yesterday.

06:05.965 --> 06:09.602 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Tillerson said relations with Russia were
at a low point.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mr. Trump agreed, but said he hopes for an
eventual thaw.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: It'd be a fantastic thing if
we got along with Putin and if we got along

06:17.043 --> 06:19.779 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
with Russia, and that could happen.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it may not happen.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It may be just the opposite.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, the president tweeted:
"Things will work out fine between the USA

06:26.953 --> 06:28.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And Russia.

06:28.755 --> 06:34.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the right time, everyone will come to their
senses and there will be lasting peace."

06:35.094 --> 06:40.199 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Another obstacle to that lasting peace is
North Korea's nuclear testing and missile

06:40.299 --> 06:42.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

06:42.301 --> 06:46.672 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The president has dispatched an American aircraft
carrier group to the region, and he's pressing

06:46.773 --> 06:50.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
China's President Xi Jinping to help bring
the North to heel.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.413 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a terrific person.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We spent a lot of time together in Florida.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.852 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And he's a very special man.

06:59.952 --> 07:00.853 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, we will see how it goes.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.655 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I think he's going to try very hard.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.993 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That vow comes amid reports
that Pyongyang may be readying for another

07:07.093 --> 07:08.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear test.

07:08.895 --> 07:15.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Japan warns the North may now be able
to load a missile warhead with nerve gas.

07:15.968 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For more on the challenges facing the Trump
White House, and its options going forward,

07:20.540 --> 07:25.011 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we turn to two men with deep military and
diplomatic knowledge.

07:25.111 --> 07:30.450 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ambassador William Burns retired from the
State Department in 2014, after serving as

07:30.550 --> 07:33.786 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
deputy secretary of state under President
Obama.

07:33.886 --> 07:39.325 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He also was ambassador to Russia and to Jordan
over his 33-year diplomatic career.

07:39.425 --> 07:43.729 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
He is now the president of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.

07:43.830 --> 07:49.635 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Retired Admiral James Stavridis, he served
as NATO supreme allied commander from 2009

07:49.735 --> 07:55.107 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to 2013, the first Naval officer to hold that
position.

07:55.208 --> 08:00.646 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
After 37 years in the U.S. Navy, he now serves
as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and

08:00.746 --> 08:03.382 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Diplomacy at Tufts University.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we welcome both of you to the "NewsHour."

08:06.319 --> 08:10.690 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Right now, we're thinking we remember all
this analysis during the campaign that this

08:10.790 --> 08:17.930 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was a president who was going to be reluctant
to use U.S. force abroad, to project the United

08:18.030 --> 08:19.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States militarily.

08:19.866 --> 08:24.637 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, Admiral Stavridis, with now this news
today of dropping a bomb in Afghanistan, the

08:24.737 --> 08:30.409 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
strike on the airfield in Syria, the threat,
in effect, toward North Korea, are we seeing

08:30.510 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
something very different, a president who
is very prepared to use military force?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES STAVRIDIS (RET.), Former NATO Supreme
Allied Commander: I think, if you look at

08:38.084 --> 08:42.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the personality involved, there's always been
a persona of toughness about Donald Trump,

08:42.355 --> 08:47.026 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
so I'm not shocked or even really surprised
at this.

08:47.126 --> 08:53.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It does fly in the face of some of his campaign
rhetoric, Judy, but I do think that the strike

08:53.533 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Syria, which I believe is really the one
to concentrate on, is a fairly well-thought-out

09:01.474 --> 09:06.479 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
strategic message that says the United States
will use force, we intend to be at the table

09:06.579 --> 09:12.985 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the Middle East, and I think has hopefully
a sobering impact both on China and on North

09:13.085 --> 09:14.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.957 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The big bomb today is really a tactical move.

09:18.057 --> 09:23.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is a big bomb, but it is not going the
change facts on the ground or send a big signal.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.531 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It's the strike in Syria to focus on.

09:25.631 --> 09:29.101 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador Burns, do you see
a strategy in all of this right now?

09:29.201 --> 09:31.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BURNS, Former U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State: I think every new administration

09:31.571 --> 09:36.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
undergoes a lot of changes on first contact
with reality.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I have to admit that the pace and scope
of the changes we have seen even in the last

09:40.246 --> 09:43.749 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
few days in the Trump administration really
do make your head spin a little bit.

09:43.849 --> 09:49.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think the big question is whether or
not the tactical shifts, the reactions, the

09:49.822 --> 09:55.328 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
impulses add up to a strategy, in other words,
a coherent and disciplined approach to America's

09:55.428 --> 10:01.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
role in the world, which lays emphasis on
our alliances, on our ability to mobilize

10:01.133 --> 10:06.472 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
other countries around the world to deal with
common problems, that sees them not as millstones,

10:06.572 --> 10:12.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as the Trump campaign rhetoric often held,
but as huge assets which set us apart from

10:12.712 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
lonelier major powers, like Russia and China.

10:15.281 --> 10:20.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But apply that question, Admiral
Stavridis, to the situation in Syria, because

10:20.152 --> 10:22.021 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- what you just referred to.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.124 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I mean, on the one hand, you have the administration
saying this was just a one-off, it was an

10:25.224 --> 10:30.062 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
attempt to send a signal to President Assad
that the U.S. will react if he uses chemical

10:30.162 --> 10:31.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapons again.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.701 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On the other hand, you have the president
describing President Assad as an animal, as

10:35.801 --> 10:38.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we have heard.

10:38.270 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It isn't entirely clear, I think, to everyone
watching what the U.S. approach to Syria is.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.511 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.648 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES STAVRIDIS: I completely agree, both
with your comment and with Ambassador Burns.

10:48.748 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think it is interesting to note that all
this occurs with an overlay of the NATO secretary-general

10:55.421 --> 11:00.826 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
coming to Washington and having a -- by all
accounts, a very good meeting with President

11:00.926 --> 11:06.232 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trump, I think, bolstering the point that
Ambassador Burns is making is that America

11:06.332 --> 11:12.104 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is so much better, so much stronger together
with our allies, with our friends.

11:12.204 --> 11:18.944 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I hope that, in Syria, NATO can be brought
along to be part of a coalition against the

11:19.045 --> 11:21.914 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Islamic State and perhaps over time against
Assad.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will see.

11:23.683 --> 11:28.954 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the salient point here is the use of forceand the willingness to do so.

11:29.055 --> 11:33.325 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I agree with Ambassador Burns, we have yet
to see a coherent strategy emerge.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.863 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Let's hope that we do, and let's hope it includes
the ideas of allies, partners and friends.

11:37.963 --> 11:41.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Apply the question, Ambassador
Burns, the one you just raised a minute ago,

11:41.967 --> 11:47.740 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to what we're seeing in Syria, and connect
that to this what appears to be new approach

11:47.840 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russia.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president sounded very complimentary toward
Vladimir Putin again for months and months.

11:53.813 --> 11:58.384 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now he is saying Putin is on the wrong sideof this major question in Syria.

11:58.484 --> 12:02.822 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BURNS: Well, it was an illusion to
think that the Trump administration was going

12:02.922 --> 12:07.927 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to be able to pull off a grand bargain, a
total normalization of U.S.-Russia relations,

12:08.027 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
because there's too much of a disconnect,
I think, right now in the way each of us,

12:12.031 --> 12:15.267 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Putin's Russia and the United States, sees
our role in the world and sees the question

12:15.367 --> 12:17.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of international order.

12:17.269 --> 12:21.874 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I have to admit I'm surprised with the
speed with which things have flipped over

12:21.974 --> 12:23.843 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the course of just the last week or so.

12:23.943 --> 12:28.080 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does what you're hearing,
Admiral Stavridis, the administration say

12:28.180 --> 12:34.019 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and do about Russia fit into what you just
described a moment ago with regard to NATO

12:34.120 --> 12:38.724 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the fact that this does now seem to be
a president who is ready to work with NATO?

12:38.824 --> 12:40.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.028 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES STAVRIDIS: I think it's a reflection
of the fact that there has been a reset.

12:43.129 --> 12:47.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We used to talk a lot about the reset with
Russia, which hoped to move us in a positive

12:47.533 --> 12:48.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here, we see a reset of reality.

12:51.170 --> 12:57.543 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Exactly as Ambassador Burns says, it's a wave
of Russian bad behavior washing over.

12:57.643 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That, Judy, has a very salutary effect on
NATO.

13:01.380 --> 13:10.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Its stock goes up as Russia's stock goes down,
precisely because, in order to work with Russia,

13:10.322 --> 13:13.125 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
we have to project strength to Russia.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.895 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That means using the NATO alliance as part
of that.

13:15.995 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I would say that we should confront Russia
where we must, on Syria, cyber-attacks on

13:21.901 --> 13:26.906 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the United States, on the invasion of Ukraine
and the annexation of Crimea, confront where

13:27.006 --> 13:29.141 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
we must, but cooperate where we can.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.976 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Let's find some zones of cooperation.

13:31.076 --> 13:34.747 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's so much more I want
to ask you both about, including China, but

13:34.847 --> 13:40.252 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I don't want to let you get away, Ambassador
Bill Burns, without asking about just the

13:40.352 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president's approach, this unpredictability,
this notion that he's keeping America's allies

13:45.858 --> 13:48.060 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and adversaries off-balance.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.929 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Is that a strategy, in and of itself?

13:50.029 --> 13:54.600 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WILLIAM BURNS: I mean, occasionally, unpredictability
can be a useful thing.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think you have also got to be careful
about, you know, the importance of consistency

13:58.904 --> 14:00.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in American foreign policy.

14:00.806 --> 14:06.946 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Whether it's friends or foes, we generally
get further in the world when we're consistent

14:07.046 --> 14:11.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and coherent in how we approach our strategy
in the world, because, otherwise, friends

14:11.817 --> 14:17.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
begin to doubt our resolve, or sometimes doubt
our leadership, and foes are attempted to

14:17.423 --> 14:21.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
try the take advantage when they're not sure
the approach the United States is going to

14:21.360 --> 14:22.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
take.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Admiral Stavridis, what about
that?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.931 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JAMES STAVRIDIS: Agree completely.

14:26.031 --> 14:32.171 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I will simply add to it that, again, we
want to be tactically surprising.

14:32.271 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We don't want to telegraph our raid or the
weapons system we're going to use or where

14:37.376 --> 14:39.945 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the next carrier strike group is going to
pop up.

14:40.045 --> 14:44.350 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, strategically, we need consistency, we
need a plan.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.153 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And that is yet to be seen from this administration.

14:48.254 --> 14:53.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I do feel that the last few days, we have
seen things moving in a better direction.

14:53.759 --> 14:59.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's be hopeful that that kind of strategic
consistency evolves, that we keep tactical

14:59.331 --> 15:01.133 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
surprise when we need to.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.303 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Together, they will help us create a positive
foreign policy.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.941 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BURNS: And if you want to pursue the
kind of strategy that Jim Stavridis was just

15:09.041 --> 15:13.145 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
describing, you have got to be able to sustain
the institutions that help you to carry that

15:13.245 --> 15:15.114 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

15:15.214 --> 15:18.150 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And when you propose a budget that would essentially
gut some of those institutions, reduce by

15:18.250 --> 15:22.955 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
30 percent, at least in the projection, you
know, the State Department's budget, the budget

15:23.055 --> 15:27.459 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for foreign assistance, you're creating a
situation in which you're almost inevitably

15:27.559 --> 15:31.997 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
going to over-rely on the use of force as
your tool of first resort, and you're going

15:32.097 --> 15:38.170 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to miss opportunities diplomatically, as well
as using foreign assistance smartly with regard

15:38.270 --> 15:43.509 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to key fragile states to try to avoid the
kind of conflicts and failures that ultimately

15:43.609 --> 15:45.911 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
drag in the U.S. military, at far greater
cost.

15:46.011 --> 15:51.116 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of which is worth takinganother long look at that.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ambassador Bill Burns, Admiral James Stavridis,we thank you both very much.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.256 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BURNS: Thanks so much.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.824 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
ADM.

15:58.924 --> 16:05.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JAMES STAVRIDIS: Thanks, Judy.

16:05.230 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump has been observed
to change his stated position on issues, sometimes

16:13.105 --> 16:16.342 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
within days or even hours of what he last
said.

16:16.442 --> 16:20.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president and his team have said he's
being flexible, and that many people have

16:20.779 --> 16:23.415 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
changed their views to match his.

16:23.515 --> 16:28.687 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
But he has made some moves that reverse statements
he made during the campaign, in particular

16:28.787 --> 16:30.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on economic policy.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Hari Sreenivasan in our New York studio has
our -- has more.

16:33.759 --> 16:38.297 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For President Trump, it's
all about pointing out that he's done what

16:38.397 --> 16:40.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he said he'd do.

16:40.299 --> 16:44.703 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He tweeted last night that his administration
has kept promises on the border, on energy,

16:44.803 --> 16:46.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on jobs, on regulations.

16:46.905 --> 16:50.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he's also made a series of reversals in
recent days.

16:50.542 --> 16:55.280 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In an interview yesterday with The Wall Street
Journal, he said he will not label China as

16:55.381 --> 16:57.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a currency manipulator.

16:57.182 --> 17:02.688 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's a stark departure from his posture
throughout the presidential campaign that

17:02.788 --> 17:04.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he'd brand Beijing on day one.

17:04.723 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
We are going to stand up to China on its massive

17:09.862 --> 17:13.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
currency manipulation, because they are beating
our companies.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.969 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And just 11 days ago, he
told The Financial Times that the Chinese

17:17.069 --> 17:22.041 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
were the -- quote -- "world champions" of
cheapening their currency to boost exports.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then came his meeting with Chinese President
Xi Jinping.

17:25.544 --> 17:31.183 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now Mr. Trump says Xi's government is not
currently manipulating its currency, and that

17:31.283 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
claiming otherwise might jeopardize Chinesecooperation on North Korea.

17:36.155 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In the same interview, the president said
he wouldn't release guidelines for tax reform

17:40.659 --> 17:44.163 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
legislation until he gets health care done.

17:44.263 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That underscored what he said during a FOX
Business interview a day earlier.

17:47.833 --> 17:53.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: We have a great health care
plan that I think will happen, and, if it

17:53.605 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
happens, then I go immediately to tax reform.

17:55.674 --> 18:00.979 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But that's a 180 from last
month, after House Republicans failed to rally

18:01.080 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare.

18:02.948 --> 18:07.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: So, now we're going to go for
tax reform, which I have always liked.

18:07.519 --> 18:12.291 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And on the subject of taxes,
in the FOX interview, the president declined

18:12.391 --> 18:17.963 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to say outright that he'd support the so-called
border adjustment tax to give U.S. companies

18:18.063 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
favorable treatment on exports and imports.

18:20.566 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: When I hear border adjustment,adjustment means we lose.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.204 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
We lose.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.072 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, I don't like the term border adjustment.

18:27.172 --> 18:31.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president also didn't
rule out keeping Federal Reserve Chair Janet

18:31.477 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yellen for another term.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he said he likes the fed's low-interest
rate policy.

18:37.082 --> 18:42.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
During the campaign, he said the opposite
on both Yellen and interest rates.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ditto on the Export-Import Bank.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.359 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
On the campaign trail, he called it unnecessary.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.797 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In The Wall Street Journal interview, he praised
it for helping small businesses and overseas

18:51.897 --> 18:55.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
companies that buy American.

18:55.167 --> 18:59.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's try to unpack some of the reasoning
behind these changes and their impact.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.475 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Carol Lee of The Wall Street Journal interviewedthe president on Wednesday.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Robert Costa covers the White House for
The Washington Post.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.248 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Carol, let me start with you.

19:09.348 --> 19:13.252 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Currency manipulation, not something we talk
about very often, but the president did talk

19:13.352 --> 19:15.120 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
a lot about this on the campaign trail.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.991 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what he said to you was the opposite of
what he's been saying for a very long time.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.859 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CAROL LEE, The Wall Street Journal: That's
right.

19:20.959 --> 19:25.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
During the campaign, then-candidate Trump
promised many times -- it was one of his go-to

19:26.031 --> 19:30.969 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lines -- that he wouldn't only label China
a currency manipulator, but do it on day one

19:31.069 --> 19:32.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his presidency.

19:33.038 --> 19:39.344 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And when he spoke to us yesterday in our interview,
he was asked about this, and his response

19:39.444 --> 19:41.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was twofold.

19:41.346 --> 19:45.317 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One, he said, China is no longer a currency
manipulator, so he doesn't need to label them

19:45.417 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a currency manipulator, that they have been
-- haven't been manipulating their currency,

19:49.755 --> 19:54.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he said, since he took office; they have been
doing it for some time before that.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.061 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
But he -- that was his first reasoning.

19:56.161 --> 20:00.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, number two, he said, even if they were
manipulating their currency, now is not the

20:00.632 --> 20:08.006 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time, because he needs China to take steps
to help him implement a policy that confronts

20:08.106 --> 20:10.108 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
North Korea, the North Korea threat.

20:10.209 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
So, it's two reasons, but it's a pretty significant
reversal, because it's one that he -- a promise

20:17.316 --> 20:21.119 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that he made multiple times on the campaign
trail, and now he's saying he doesn't need

20:21.220 --> 20:22.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it.

20:23.088 --> 20:27.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert, health care, according
to these interviews, is back on the table.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How come?

20:29.628 --> 20:32.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You famously got the phone call after the
health care bill didn't make it to the floor.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.700 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And he said that it's not health care.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It's, we're moving on the taxes.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
What happened, do you think?

20:38.537 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington Post: There's
a big push from the Republican base to have

20:41.640 --> 20:46.378 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the GOP majorities in the Congress and, of
course, the White House follow through on

20:46.478 --> 20:49.381 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the promises they made during the 2016 campaign.

20:49.481 --> 20:54.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You saw this on the ground this past week
in the Kansas House special election.

20:54.152 --> 20:59.524 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You see it ahead of next Tuesday, where there
is a special House election in Georgia.

20:59.625 --> 21:04.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Republicans want to see action on health care
and on taxes.

21:04.129 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's why, as much as the president told
me and others that he may shelve the health

21:07.833 --> 21:12.304 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
care bill for the moment and look for Democrats
down the line to come back to the bargaining

21:12.404 --> 21:17.476 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
table, he's at the top of a party that wants
movement.

21:17.576 --> 21:22.080 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's why we see Congress during this
recess starting to reengage on that issue.

21:22.180 --> 21:28.053 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carol, was there some rationale
that he offered to you all about why his thinking

21:28.153 --> 21:29.821 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is changing on these things?

21:29.921 --> 21:34.326 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CAROL LEE: Well, there were different rationales
for different changes that he made.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.963 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
He discussed the one about currency manipulation.

21:38.063 --> 21:44.469 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He also talked about his views on the chairwoman
of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who

21:44.569 --> 21:47.406 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
he was sharply critical of during the campaign.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And he said he met her, he liked her, he respects
her.

21:50.509 --> 21:54.012 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he left open the possibility of nominating
her again.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.581 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He spoke about Russia, about China.

21:56.682 --> 22:02.721 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There was one particular instance where very
early on in the interview he talked about

22:02.821 --> 22:05.957 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
President Xi of children, and meeting him,
and how he went into that meeting telling

22:06.058 --> 22:11.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
him that he thought it was easy for China
to pressure North Korea, that they had a lot

22:11.763 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of power over North Korea, and he should be
able to easily handle that issue.

22:15.901 --> 22:20.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he said that President Xi then went into
the history of China and Korea, and within

22:20.872 --> 22:25.811 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
10 minutes, President Trump said that he realized
it's not so easy for China to just take care

22:25.911 --> 22:30.082 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the North Korea problem, because they don't
have as much power as he thought they did.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.884 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, there is -- you know, he kind of walkedthrough his thinking on that.

22:32.984 --> 22:36.922 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so he's a little more sympathetic to the
Chinese in terms of what they're able to do

22:37.022 --> 22:38.724 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
to help him on the North Korea issue.

22:38.824 --> 22:42.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert, how much of this
-- I mean, what Carol is saying, certainly

22:42.260 --> 22:45.897 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
some part of it is the president realizing
that things are much more complicated when

22:45.997 --> 22:47.766 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you're actually behind the desk.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.603 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
How much of it is also the forces that are
at work inside the White House, the different

22:51.703 --> 22:53.805 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
power struggles that you have been documenting?

22:53.905 --> 22:58.910 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT COSTA: The political environment inside
of the West Wing is certainly a factor as

22:59.010 --> 23:01.146 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
President Trump thinks through his decisions.

23:01.246 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Based on my reporting, there are certain people
right now who have very influential voices

23:06.585 --> 23:11.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the ear of the president, in particular
Gary Cohn, the president's top economic adviser,a

23:11.857 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
former Goldman Sachs executive, Dina Powell,
the deputy national security adviser and a

23:16.161 --> 23:21.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
former George W. Bush official in that White
House, as well as Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and his daughter Ivanka.

23:23.602 --> 23:28.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They come out of a more centrist Republican
and even Democratic mold, when speaking of

23:28.707 --> 23:30.642 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Cohn, who is still a registered Democrat.

23:30.742 --> 23:35.347 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they're urging the president privately
to more in a more mainstream, centrist direction.

23:35.447 --> 23:40.519 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You also have H.R. McMaster, the new national
security adviser, who is a Republican hawk.

23:40.619 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, these non-interventionist instincts that
we saw during the campaign with the president

23:45.090 --> 23:48.693 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
seem to have faded a bit with the Syria strike
and now this action in Afghanistan.

23:48.794 --> 23:54.433 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And you see Stephen Bannon, the populist nationalist
at the president's side, being demoted, still

23:54.533 --> 23:56.535 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in the White House, but not as influential.

23:56.635 --> 24:00.305 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carol, speaking of Stephen
Bannon, he didn't do him any favors.

24:00.405 --> 24:04.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He sort of almost distanced himself from him,
or at least minimized his role during the

24:04.109 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president's interview with you.

24:05.477 --> 24:06.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAROL LEE: He did.

24:06.678 --> 24:08.413 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It was a very interesting moment.

24:08.513 --> 24:13.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We asked him what to make of his comments
the previous day in The New York Post, where

24:13.552 --> 24:19.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he said that -- you know, he really distanced
himself from Steve Bannon, said that he's

24:19.257 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his own -- the president said he's his own
strategist and tried to diminish that role.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we said, well, what should we make of
those comments?

24:25.864 --> 24:29.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the president's response was, well, you
know, he's a guy who works for me, which is

24:29.935 --> 24:33.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a really understatement.

24:33.905 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And he said -- he also said, I am my own strategist.

24:37.042 --> 24:42.147 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, in saying that, it was something that
he repeated again, it was very clear that

24:42.247 --> 24:48.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he is trying to set the tone that he wants
-- that he's in charge, and he not only was

24:48.553 --> 24:53.024 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
frustrated with some of the overshadowing
that was happening with Steve Bannon and some

24:53.124 --> 24:57.362 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the parodies that were out there about
him and how he was controlling Trump.

24:57.462 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think the president also then, as Robert
reported, got very frustrated with the infighting,

25:04.002 --> 25:07.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
particularly between Steve Bannon and his
son-in-law.

25:07.305 --> 25:10.942 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he said that he told them that they needed
to work it out.

25:11.042 --> 25:14.613 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We asked him if he planned on having the same
team in six months.

25:14.713 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And he said, I like my team, but I don't know.

25:16.982 --> 25:17.916 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Maybe I will make some changes.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maybe I won't.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.586 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert, finally to you,
how do you cover a president like this who

25:21.686 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
tells The Financial Times 10 days before Carol's
interview something company different than

25:24.990 --> 25:28.159 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what he tells Carol, and then perhaps, the
next time you talk with him, it's going to

25:28.260 --> 25:30.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be something else?

25:30.195 --> 25:33.765 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT COSTA: In a way, it's almost predictable,
having covered the president for a few years,

25:33.865 --> 25:37.402 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as has Carol, very deeply over the last few
years.

25:37.502 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
You know that this is a nonideological president.

25:40.739 --> 25:45.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Unlike President Obama, who was mounting his
own version of a liberal progressive project,

25:45.677 --> 25:51.783 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
or George W. Bush with his compassionate conservatism,
or even with Ronald Reagan, decades ago, with

25:51.883 --> 25:56.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his conservative movement, with Trump, you
have a president who, at the center of it

25:56.521 --> 26:01.593 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
all, wants to do what's best for him, his
own popularity, his own standing, rather than

26:01.693 --> 26:04.429 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
necessarily his party or an ideology.

26:04.529 --> 26:08.667 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
So, he is susceptible to shift with the politicalwinds and to make decisions.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.468 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.571 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Carol
Lee of The Wall Street Journal, thank you

26:12.671 --> 26:13.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
both.

26:13.772 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAROL LEE: Thank you.

26:22.714 --> 26:25.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:25.817 --> 26:30.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": what the U.S.
could learn from simpler tax systems used

26:30.555 --> 26:37.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by other countries; high school students write
a musical work about U.S. internment camps;

26:37.762 --> 26:42.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and a lawyer's brief take on racial injustice
in America.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.537 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
But, next, we head back to Mexico.

26:45.637 --> 26:50.675 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On Tuesday, we reported from Mexico's northern
border with the U.S. Tonight, we travel to

26:50.775 --> 26:52.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mexico's southern border.

26:52.677 --> 26:58.617 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are the
world's deadliest countries outside war zones.

26:58.717 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Many Central Americans flee violence and poverty,
and hope to reach the U.S. Mexican authorities

27:05.190 --> 27:10.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are now trying to block their movement, but
critics are asking, at what cost?

27:10.662 --> 27:15.967 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Special correspondent Nick Schifrin begins
his report tonight in Ciudad Hidalgo on Mexico's

27:16.067 --> 27:20.238 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
southern tip, on the river that separates
Mexico from Guatemala.

27:20.338 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On this border, the sound ofthe water is the sound of hope.

27:26.778 --> 27:30.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Suchiate River separates Guatemala from
the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.

27:30.715 --> 27:34.686 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every day, thousands of Central Americans
cross north, dreaming of more peaceful and

27:34.786 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prosperous lives.

27:37.522 --> 27:39.524 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
There's no security and no authorities.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.260 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The rafts are inner tubes with plywood planks.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Entire families travel together.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.897 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Women bring their children.

27:45.997 --> 27:50.268 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Each crossing costs 50 cents, but many can't
afford that, so, on this day, the water is

27:50.368 --> 27:55.473 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
low enough to walk across for free barefoot.

27:55.573 --> 27:59.544 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Leading the way in the backpacks are 21-year-old
Dilber Avila and his 15-year-old brother,

27:59.644 --> 28:00.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Eduardo Hernandez.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're from Honduras.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.116 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
DILBER AVILA, Honduran Migrant (through translator):
We're very poor there.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.052 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The house we live in is made of mud.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.753 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It could collapse on us at any point.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, we went on our way to look for a better
life.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: They're unsure how far north
they will go.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.328 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have heard the route is dangerous, but
they're hopeful and willing to sacrifice.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DILBER AVILA (through translator): This path
is tricky.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.000 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You never know how it will go.

28:22.100 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
With the help of our lord watching over us
as we travel, we pray, and he sends angels

28:26.171 --> 28:27.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to help us on our journey.

28:27.806 --> 28:32.410 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In total, 450,000 people arecrossing the border every year.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Some will just go for the day to shop or sell.

28:34.546 --> 28:40.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But for many others, this is the first moment
of a long, dangerous journey north.

28:40.518 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Their first destination is the Mexican city
of Tapachula.

28:43.321 --> 28:47.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The shelter run by Todo Por Ellos, or All
For Them, offers them a safe place to stay.

28:47.992 --> 28:53.264 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
In the last two years, more than 900,000 unaccompanied
Central American children have crossed into

28:53.364 --> 28:54.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mexico.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.369 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Eleven-year-old Luis Uno de Lyon fled El Salvadorto escape horrific violence.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.773 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LUIS UNO DE LYON, El Salvadorian Asylum Seeker
(through translator): I have a brother who

29:01.873 --> 29:04.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was in a gang, and they told me they wanted
to kill me.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They entered my house.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.946 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They hit me, and they said they will kill
me.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I had to leave.

29:10.048 --> 29:13.585 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My dream as an immigrant is to reach America
and meet my mother.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.053 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I don't want to stay here.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.821 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I want to go and stay in America.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.924 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This has been his bed for the
last three months.

29:20.024 --> 29:23.461 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
What do you want to be when you grow up?

29:23.561 --> 29:24.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A migration judge.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

29:26.731 --> 29:31.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LUIS UNO DE LYON (through translator): To
help migrants achieve their dreams.

29:31.169 --> 29:36.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Increasingly, those dreams
stay alive here, outside the local immigration

29:36.708 --> 29:38.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

This group of Hondurans are applying for Mexican
humanitarian visas so they can travel north

29:41.479 --> 29:43.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more safely.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.117 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JONATHAN JIMENEZ, Honduran Asylum Seeker (through
translator): I am trying to get to America.

29:46.217 --> 29:50.355 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I know that there are many risks traveling
through Mexico safely, and I have heard about

29:50.455 --> 29:51.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people getting hurt.

29:51.556 --> 29:53.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This permit will protect me.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Twenty-two-year-old JonathanJimenez is from Honduras.

29:56.094 --> 30:00.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He says, under President Trump, the U.S. is
harder to reach and deportations are more

30:00.365 --> 30:01.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
likely.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But he won't be dissuaded.

30:03.234 --> 30:07.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JONATHAN JIMENEZ (through translator): Even
if I can just $100 a month, it means a lot.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.707 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
America is the land of opportunity.

30:09.808 --> 30:14.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But Mexico has always struggled
to assist Central Americans who are here temporarily

30:14.679 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before they move north.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At night, the group of Hondurans wanders the
street.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.653 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They didn't bring any paperwork from home,
so they can't work.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They can't afford to rent rooms.

30:23.188 --> 30:24.322 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Where will you sleep tonight?

30:24.422 --> 30:25.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where will you sleep?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.959 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JONATHAN JIMENEZ (through translator): Thetruth is that we don't know.

30:28.059 --> 30:30.695 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I haven't been told, and no one knows where
they will go.

30:30.795 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why is it worth being here
in order to try and get to the U.S.?

30:35.066 --> 30:39.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JONATHAN JIMENEZ (through translator): There
are gangs and so much crime and violence back

30:39.571 --> 30:41.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

30:41.439 --> 30:44.609 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I believe that this is an important goal that
I must achieve, and all the suffering will

30:44.709 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be worth it.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.745 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I have to think about helping my family.

30:47.846 --> 30:52.650 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Forty-year-old Rosa has decided,
to help her family, she has to stay in Mexico.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.286 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She's from El Salvador, and has lived here
for four months.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.789 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
She received asylum because she fled violence.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.390 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
She sits with her nephew.

30:59.490 --> 31:02.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROSA, Refugee (through translator): Then theysent someone to attack me.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
They asked me for $75.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.197 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I couldn't afford that kind of extortion.

31:06.297 --> 31:10.435 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She longs to live in the U.S.,
but the journey would cost $5,000.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So she's staying.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tapachula is safe.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROSA (through translator): I wake up early,
and nothing happens.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.375 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I am out until late, and it's safe.

31:17.475 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Back home, at 6:00 p.m., everyone goes inside,
and you can find danger at every corner.

31:22.013 --> 31:26.551 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: More and more Central Americansare deciding to stay in Mexico.

31:26.651 --> 31:30.321 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In 2011, 752 Central Americans applied for
asylum.

31:30.421 --> 31:33.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In 2017, the U.N. estimates that number will
be more than 22,000.

31:33.992 --> 31:38.696 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAOLA BOLOGNESI, U.N. Refugee Agency: These
are really the persons who have no choice

31:38.796 --> 31:40.899 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but to leave their country in order to save
their life

31:40.999 --> 31:45.236 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Paola Bolognesi is a U.N. RefugeeAgency protection officer.

31:45.336 --> 31:48.840 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She says asylum requests are increasing becauseof a U.N. education campaign.

31:48.940 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAOLA BOLOGNESI (through translator): We are
making a big effort in providing this information

31:53.511 --> 31:59.417 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
through posters and leaflets and talks.

31:59.517 --> 32:04.622 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: At the same time, migrant arrivals
are decreasing, in part of because of Mexican

32:04.722 --> 32:06.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
efforts to stop them.

32:06.557 --> 32:10.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the last three years, the government has
created rings of security within 100 miles

32:10.228 --> 32:11.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the border.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.564 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Police use checkpoints to find drugs and migrants.

32:13.665 --> 32:19.003 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mexico is now finding and deporting more Central
Americans than the United States is.

32:19.103 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In the past, the train known as La Bestia,
or The Beast, was covered in Central Americans

32:23.341 --> 32:25.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
riding north toward the U.S.

32:25.176 --> 32:28.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, today, Mexican authorities have tried
to make it much more difficult for migrants

32:28.680 --> 32:30.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to ride these trains.

32:30.581 --> 32:34.152 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There's a private security company that prevents
migrants from getting on the train, and they

32:34.252 --> 32:38.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have built these concrete barriers just a
few inches from the edge of the train.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.859 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The idea is to make it much more dangerous
to jump from the train.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.964 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That danger has reduced the number of train
riders, but it's also killed three migrants

32:46.064 --> 32:49.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in this stretch, says immigrant rights activist
Sergio Luna.

32:49.200 --> 32:53.338 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SERGIO LUNA, Immigrants Rights Activist (through
translator): This type of structure is a clear

32:53.438 --> 32:56.274 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
violation against the human rights of migrants.

32:56.374 --> 33:01.045 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Luna runs La Sagrada Familia
shelter right next to the train tracks.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are 500 miles north of the Mexico-Guatemala
border.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He says Mexico's methods to deter migrants
are brutal.

33:07.785 --> 33:11.889 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
SERGIO LUNA (through translator): Mexico doesthe U.S.' dirty work, in a way.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.727 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're at a turning point when it comes to
a marked increase in institutionalized violence

33:15.827 --> 33:17.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against migrants.

33:17.628 --> 33:22.900 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A pro-immigration activist
Web site hosted this video of immigration

33:23.001 --> 33:25.036 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
agents abusing a Honduran migrant.

33:25.136 --> 33:30.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An immigration official told "PBS NewsHour"
this was a -- quote -- "rational use of force."

33:30.708 --> 33:34.012 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Why can't you better protect these migrants
who are moving north?

33:34.112 --> 33:38.182 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CARLOS SADA SOLANA, Mexican Deputy Foreign
Minister: The issue is that it is not the

33:38.282 --> 33:39.851 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
authorities that are violating human rights.

33:39.951 --> 33:43.454 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
You know that you have to include drug trafficking.

33:43.554 --> 33:46.991 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Carlos Sada Solana is Mexico's
deputy foreign minister.

33:47.091 --> 33:51.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But do you acknowledge that there are some
authorities in Southern Mexico that are abusing

33:51.562 --> 33:52.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these migrants?

33:52.730 --> 33:53.965 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
CARLOS SADA SOLANA: Well, I think that everywhere.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.035 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You cannot say that, in the United States,
there is not.

33:57.135 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But many of the migrants accuse
authorities of threats and extortion.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.008 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Twenty-one-year-old David Gonzales is from
Honduras.

34:04.108 --> 34:07.045 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He crossed the border 18 days ago, hoping
to get to the U.S.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.314 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID GONZALES, Honduran Migrant (through
translator): I was approached by state police.

34:10.415 --> 34:15.019 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They took me to the station, accused me of
burglary, took everything I had, stripped

34:15.119 --> 34:16.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
me down and left me naked.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They gave me a choice.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I can either take my money, and they will
lock me up for a crime I didn't commit, or

34:21.759 --> 34:23.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I can leave without my money.

34:23.428 --> 34:24.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I left.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.565 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're no longer migrants, but a business forthose who take advantage of us.

34:27.665 --> 34:31.936 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He used to live in Texas and
North Carolina, and made in one day as a gardener

34:32.036 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
what it took him one week to make at home.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he says he's now giving up on getting
back to the U.S.

34:37.442 --> 34:40.278 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID GONZALES (through translator): It's
no longer worth it.

34:40.378 --> 34:42.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Laws have changed.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.716 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A new president has been inaugurated who doesn't
want us, because he says we're the bad guys.

34:45.817 --> 34:51.122 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
What he doesn't understand, with all due respect,
the migrant who goes there goes just to work.

34:51.222 --> 34:55.059 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Twenty-five-year-old Alner
Mendez has also given up his American dream.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We met him on the train tracks.

34:56.994 --> 34:59.864 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALNER MENDEZ, Guatemalan Migrant (through
translator): I was scared of being detained.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.766 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It wasn't worth me going.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There's so many people who have lived in the
United States for years who are being deported.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But he says he's been treated
so badly here, he doesn't trust Mexico either.

35:08.973 --> 35:11.175 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So he's headed south, back home to Guatemala.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.479 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALNER MENDEZ (through translator): I don'tfeel safe here in Mexico.

35:14.579 --> 35:17.348 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Aside from organized crime, authorities also
extort us.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They ask us for money.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.751 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And if we don't hand it over, they beat us.

35:20.852 --> 35:24.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mendez climbs the train, andasks his friend for a photo.

35:24.355 --> 35:27.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's the closest he will get to the journey
north.

35:28.092 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The train leaves empty, without him, without
the Central Americans whose difficult journey

35:32.263 --> 35:34.532 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
through Mexico meant they lost hope.

35:34.632 --> 35:42.240 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick Schifrin
in Apizaco, Mexico.

35:42.340 --> 35:53.818 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's tax season, a dreaded
time for many Americans feeling burdened as

35:53.918 --> 35:57.555 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they complete forms that many argue have become
too complicated.

35:57.655 --> 36:03.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, as Congress and President Trump weigh
changes to the tax system, our economics correspondent,

36:03.961 --> 36:07.331 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Paul Solman, looks at what we can learn from
other countries.

36:07.431 --> 36:11.135 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's part of his series Making Sense, which
airs every Thursday.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Taxes.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.040 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Americans have been griping about them ever
since the revolution.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States:
I would like to speak to you tonight about

36:18.309 --> 36:20.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our future.

36:20.211 --> 36:24.048 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Two hundred years later, in 1985,
President Ronald Reagan gave this assessment

36:24.148 --> 36:25.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the tax code:

36:26.050 --> 36:30.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RONALD REAGAN: Complicated, unfair, cluttered
with gobbledygook and loopholes designed for

36:30.321 --> 36:34.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
those with the power and influence to hire
high-priced legal and tax advisers.

36:35.092 --> 36:41.232 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: The next year, Reagan signed
into law our last major income tax reform:

36:41.332 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lower rates, fewer loopholes.

36:43.968 --> 36:45.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot of good it did.

36:45.436 --> 36:48.372 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thirty years later, House Speaker Paul Ryan
told Judy Woodruff:

36:48.472 --> 36:50.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the House: We
have the worst tax code in the industrialized

36:52.176 --> 36:53.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world, bar none.

36:53.811 --> 36:57.048 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, what we can learn from therest of the world about taxes?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Writer T.R.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.352 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Reid took us to the New Zealand Embassy in
Washington to explain.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.223 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID, Author, "A Fine Mess": New Zealand isa model of good tax policy.

37:05.323 --> 37:09.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have done what all the economists think
is right, to get a tax code that is simple,

37:10.094 --> 37:12.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fair and efficient.

37:12.163 --> 37:18.469 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Reid, a former Washington Post
foreign bureau chief, has reported from around

37:18.569 --> 37:20.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world for decades.

37:20.838 --> 37:26.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For his latest book, "A Fine Mess," Reid went
on a global quest for a better tax system.

37:26.811 --> 37:30.181 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He really liked New Zealand's formula, BBLR.

37:30.281 --> 37:31.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

37:31.382 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
REID: BBLR, broaden the base, lower the rates.

37:34.852 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, you broaden the base by making everything
taxable.

37:38.022 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If your employer gives you free parking, well,
in New Zealand, they say, gee, that would

37:41.759 --> 37:43.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cost $20 a month.

37:43.227 --> 37:44.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's income to you.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.698 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If your employer pays your health insurance,
that's income to you.

37:47.798 --> 37:50.568 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then, you know, you want to buy a housewith a mortgage, that's fine.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.303 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
You don't get a tax break for it.

37:52.403 --> 37:56.240 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have rates less than half of ours, and
they bring in more money per capita.

37:56.340 --> 38:00.344 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: And for Kiwis like Ben Contreras
(ph), filing couldn't be simpler.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.713 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BEN CONTRERAS, New Zealander: I never thought
about taxes when I lived in New Zealand.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For most people, you don't really have to
take any time out to take care of your taxes

38:06.050 --> 38:07.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every year.

38:07.551 --> 38:10.354 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Contreras has worked in the
U.S. for three years.

38:10.454 --> 38:16.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Filing his taxes now requires the help of
often bedeviling computer software, a heavy

38:16.360 --> 38:17.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
price to pay, says Reid.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

38:19.864 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: Americans spend about six billion hours
a year collecting the data and filling out

38:22.967 --> 38:24.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the forms.

38:24.802 --> 38:29.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We spend $10 billion to H&amp;R Block and other
preparers and, on top of that, $2 billion

38:29.707 --> 38:33.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in tax preparation software, which still takes
hours of work.

38:33.544 --> 38:36.180 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it's outrageous, the burden we put on
people.

38:36.280 --> 38:40.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: And how long does it take to
do your income taxes or file your income taxes

38:40.518 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in some of these countries, if it's so simple?

38:42.253 --> 38:43.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.258 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: I was in the Netherlands on March 31,
the day before their taxes are due.

38:47.358 --> 38:53.364 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I was with an executive who makes $200,000
a year, two mortgages, a lot of investments.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.666 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He'd have to fill out 12 forms in America.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.868 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I said, Michael, how do you pay your taxes?

38:57.968 --> 38:59.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He pops a beer.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He goes online.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.173 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The government's filled in every line.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.008 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
If the numbers look right, he clicks OK.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It takes five minutes.

39:05.943 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, in Japan, you get a postcard from the
IRS that says, we think you made this much.

39:12.383 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We withheld this much.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.252 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We owe you a refund of that much.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.921 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We will put it in your bank on April 1.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.657 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It takes one minute, if you think the numbers
are right.

39:19.757 --> 39:24.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I said to my friend Togo (ph), you know,
in America, people spend hours, days filling

39:24.962 --> 39:26.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out these forms.

39:26.263 --> 39:28.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he said to me, why would anybody want
to do that?

39:28.632 --> 39:30.701 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you explained to him nobody
does.

T.R.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REID: I said, nobody does, yes.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And guess what, Paul?

39:34.705 --> 39:36.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We could do that here.

39:36.340 --> 39:40.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The IRS could fill in every line of the returnfor most American families.

39:40.578 --> 39:41.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They know all the numbers.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.582 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

Have you ever gotten a CP-2000 letter?

39:44.682 --> 39:48.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This is the one that says, on line 48-Q, you
entered $4,211.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, yes, yes.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

39:50.821 --> 39:51.622 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%

39:51.722 --> 39:52.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Actually, yes, yes.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.094 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: And I get that every year, and I think,
why did I spend hours trying to fill this

39:57.194 --> 39:58.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out, when they knew?

39:58.996 --> 40:04.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so some members of Congress have suggested
that the IRS fill out the forms for us.

40:04.101 --> 40:08.639 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And H&amp;R Block and the tax software companies
lobby against it.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.842 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So here's the deal: You do more work; they
make more money.

40:11.942 --> 40:16.580 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what are the most egregious
absurdities of the tax system, in your view?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%

for specific groups or specific companies.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.056 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have this scene in my book where the president
goes to Congress and says, here's a great

40:26.157 --> 40:27.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

40:27.792 --> 40:34.398 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's send a check for $7,500 to anybody whobuys a $138,000 BMW hybrid car.

40:34.498 --> 40:35.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We'd never do that, would we?

40:35.800 --> 40:36.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
PAUL SOLMAN: No.

T.R.

40:37.802 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

40:39.036 --> 40:39.703 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have a list here of stuff you get a write-off
for.

40:39.804 --> 40:40.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You ready?

40:40.805 --> 40:41.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, sure.

T.R.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.375 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

to charity, taking a night school course.

40:44.475 --> 40:45.676 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hey, wait, stop.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Contributing to charity, surely, that's a
good thing.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.314 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You want to encourage people to give to charity,
right?

T.R.

40:51.415 --> 40:52.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REID: Yes, but it doesn't work.

40:52.983 --> 40:55.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Many countries have gotten rid of it, andhere's -- there's a pattern.

40:55.419 --> 41:01.725 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
For one year, there's a small blip in contributions,
and then it goes up again at the rate of income

41:01.826 --> 41:02.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increase.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.628 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
People give because they want to help.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, of course, the charitable
deduction is just one of thousands.

T.R.

41:09.934 --> 41:14.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: So, you get a deduction in America for
taking a night school course, growing sugarcane,

41:14.472 --> 41:18.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
moving to a new city for a job, replanting
a forest, insulating the attic, destroying

41:18.843 --> 41:24.515 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
old farm equipment, employing Native Americans,
commuting to work by bicycle, or buying a

41:24.615 --> 41:27.818 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
plug-in hybrid sports car, or buying a recreational
vehicle.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.821 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, there are hundreds of them, and most
of them are nuts.

41:30.921 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, why can't we get rid of theseprovisions in the United States?

41:35.693 --> 41:37.428 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
T.R.

41:37.528 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: Because, in the United States, unlike
any other advanced democracy, money really

41:41.165 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
talks.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there are more than 400 additions to the
tax code every year, and most of them are

41:46.770 --> 41:49.607 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
giveaways to one or two taxpayers.

41:49.707 --> 41:54.211 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, if there were good reasons for these
clauses, they would put in there who's going

41:54.311 --> 41:56.213 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to benefit and what's it for.

41:56.313 --> 42:02.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, in fact, if you read the tax code, it
says, here's a tax break for any company incorporated

42:02.186 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Delaware on October 13, 1916.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, that's General Motors, but they never
say that.

42:08.025 --> 42:11.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the tax code is full of these things,
where they don't mention the name, but it

42:11.762 --> 42:13.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
helps one taxpayer.

42:13.597 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Are Americans right to hate the
aptly named tax burden that we bear, both

42:20.671 --> 42:22.473 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
in the income tax and taxes overall?

42:22.573 --> 42:23.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

42:23.908 --> 42:25.776 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

is to file.

42:25.876 --> 42:30.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, if you take the amount, the check you
have to write, no, we're getting off easy.

42:30.648 --> 42:36.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Of the 35 richest countries, in total tax
burden, U.S. ranks 33rd.

42:36.353 --> 42:41.191 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And in return, our government spends less
as a percentage of GDP than other governments.

42:41.292 --> 42:44.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You hear all this stuff about spendthrift
big government?

42:44.762 --> 42:50.134 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Relative to other rich countries, our government
is a penny-pincher.

42:50.234 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, we pay less, but we complain
more?

42:53.604 --> 42:54.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T.R.

42:54.605 --> 42:55.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
REID: Yes.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Yes, Americans complain about tax more than
any other country.

42:57.675 --> 43:02.713 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In many countries, the IRS agency is the mostrespected government agency.

&nbsp;
Get this.

43:04.715 --> 43:09.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Japan, this movie "Marusa No Onna," "Audit
Bureau Woman," won best picture, best actor,

43:09.553 --> 43:11.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best actress.

43:11.422 --> 43:16.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's about this perky, pretty young auditor
in the Tokyo tax bureau who goes after a big

43:16.293 --> 43:18.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evader.

43:18.228 --> 43:23.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He rides around Tokyo in this chauffeur-driven
white Rolls-Royce, and our heroine is chasing

43:23.400 --> 43:24.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

43:24.401 --> 43:25.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's total David and Goliath.

43:25.936 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, in the end, she nails him, and everybody
in the audience cheers.

43:29.640 --> 43:34.945 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Can you imagine casting Meg Ryan as a peppy,
pretty IRS auditor who goes after people?

43:35.045 --> 43:36.847 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I don't think Hollywood would do that.

43:36.947 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I was thinking Julia Roberts,
but, no, the IRS superhero remains an Oscar

43:43.020 --> 43:44.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long shot.

43:44.154 --> 43:47.424 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But there is hope for the system, says Reid.

T.R.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
REID: Everybody in every party agrees that
our code is a mess.

43:50.961 --> 43:54.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's unfair, it's complicated, it's inefficient,
needs to be fixed.

43:54.999 --> 43:57.935 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the way to fix it is to do it big, asother countries have done.

43:58.035 --> 44:01.005 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I think even the U.S. Congress will figure
this out.

PAUL SOLMAN: T.R.

44:28.232 --> 44:31.835 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
to examine a painful chapter in U.S. history.

44:31.935 --> 44:35.739 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Along the way, they're discovering some connections

Jeffrey Brown reports from Los Angeles.

JEFFREY BROWN: Where can I be an American,
if not here?

44:54.425 --> 45:00.698 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a question posed by students at Van Nuys
High school in Los Angeles, part of a 45-minute

45:00.798 --> 45:06.770 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
oratorio they wrote and composed, working
and singing with professionals from the prestigious

45:06.870 --> 45:09.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Los Angeles Chorale.

45:09.606 --> 45:14.578 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Titled "In America," it's about the experience
of Japanese Americans forced to leave their

45:14.678 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
homes for internment camps during World War
II.

45:18.015 --> 45:23.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Chorale has been doing this work in L.A.
schools for 15 years, choosing historical

45:23.420 --> 45:27.357 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
themes the students would find relevant.

45:27.458 --> 45:36.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This time, says the Chorale's Alice Kirwan
Murray, who served as lead teaching artist,

45:36.200 --> 45:38.068 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
they got more than they bargained for.

45:38.168 --> 45:41.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALICE KIRWAN MURRAY, Los Angeles Master Chorale:
This story is an enormous tragedy, and I find

45:41.171 --> 45:45.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it fairly alarming that, 75 years ago, this
occurred.

45:45.642 --> 45:53.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what I also found alarming was that the
students were not that surprised by it.

45:53.350 --> 46:00.290 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Many of them, as immigrants themselves, have
faced similar suspicion and bias and mistreatment.

46:00.390 --> 46:01.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was very relatable to them.

46:01.992 --> 46:05.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Van Nuys High has seen its
share of stars.

46:05.362 --> 46:10.501 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Among its famous students were Marilyn Monroe,
Robert Redford, and Natalie Wood.

46:10.601 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This area and the school were once mostly
white, but now are majority Latino.

46:15.973 --> 46:21.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some are very new immigrants, like sophomore
Rafael Gomez, who came here from Mexico last

46:21.278 --> 46:23.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summer.

46:23.113 --> 46:26.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RAFAEL GOMEZ, Student (through translator):
I enjoy singing this because it has a lot

46:26.350 --> 46:30.988 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of meaning, especially the part where it says,
don't judge me because I am different.

46:31.088 --> 46:34.558 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Just because someone is of a different race
or has a different color of skin, they shouldn't

46:34.658 --> 46:36.426 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
be judged before you get to know them.

46:36.527 --> 46:41.665 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: To learn about this earlier
moment in American history, the students read,

46:41.765 --> 46:46.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
researched, and visited L.A.'s Japanese American
National Museum, where they heard stories

46:47.037 --> 46:49.573 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of survivors of the camps.

46:49.673 --> 46:53.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mas Yamashita was 6 when his family was sent
to Topaz camp in Utah.

46:53.544 --> 46:57.247 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAS YAMASHITA, Held in Internment Camp: I
was able to tell them about my personal experiences,

46:57.347 --> 47:03.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and it seems to always help students to relate
to the experiences if they can meet somebody

47:03.554 --> 47:06.290 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who actually experienced it.

47:06.390 --> 47:11.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Seniors Olivia Rodriguez and
Lucy White said they didn't know much about

47:11.762 --> 47:14.798 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that dark period of American history, until
now.

47:14.898 --> 47:18.535 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
OLIVIA RODRIGUEZ, Student: How hard it was
for everyone to leave their homes and what

47:18.635 --> 47:23.707 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they knew, just a huge divide between the
American people, the Japanese American people,

47:23.807 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the Japanese-born people.

47:25.609 --> 47:30.781 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LUCY WHITE, Student: I really just wanted
to illustrate truthfully the awful, awful

47:30.881 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
struggle that these people went through and
that their country forced them into.

47:34.952 --> 47:39.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: The students also conducted
interviews with their own family members about

47:39.423 --> 47:42.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
their own immigration stories.

47:42.326 --> 47:46.597 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Brianne Arevalo is the school's choir director.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BRIANNE AREVALO, Choir Director, Van Nuys
High School: Even students that weren't immigrants

47:48.966 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
themselves, they may have family members,
so maybe grandma and grandpa were immigrants,

47:54.371 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighbors.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.508 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Like, in this community, everybody knows some
immigrant.

47:58.609 --> 48:02.746 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And so whether they have gone through it personally
themselves or they were able to share in somebody

48:02.846 --> 48:09.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
else's experience, every single student got
something so powerful and a really deep meaning

48:09.419 --> 48:11.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of this project.

48:11.288 --> 48:17.394 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: For everyone involved, the
resulting work, nine movements in all, resonated

48:17.494 --> 48:21.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with today's political debates.

48:21.131 --> 48:28.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Olivia Rodriguez is a second-generation American
of Mexican heritage.

48:28.505 --> 48:31.008 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
OLIVIA RODRIGUEZ: I repeatedly say, move to
America.

48:31.108 --> 48:32.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Move to America.

48:32.476 --> 48:33.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Live the American dream.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.812 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what did those lines mean
to you?

48:35.913 --> 48:40.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
OLIVIA RODRIGUEZ: I think I was trying to
be that hope for the people, and show how

48:40.884 --> 48:43.921 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
important it was for these people to come
to America.

48:44.021 --> 48:49.459 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then towards the end of the piece, towards
the end of the entire oratorio, so, by the

48:49.559 --> 48:53.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time I'm done, they're saying, how can I be
-- live in America if I'm not -- if I don't

48:54.031 --> 48:57.801 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
feel American, if I'm not being treated like
another American?

48:57.901 --> 49:04.474 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Mas Yamashita, who attended
a final rehearsal, the emotions of long ago

49:04.574 --> 49:06.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were still raw.

49:06.443 --> 49:12.015 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAS YAMASHITA: They were flashing pictures
from the camps, and the lyrics that the students

49:12.115 --> 49:20.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
wrote, it was just -- just brings back a lotof those emotions for me.

49:20.557 --> 49:22.426 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
I was ashamed of being in the camp.

49:22.526 --> 49:23.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never told anybody.

49:24.094 --> 49:27.631 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was probably 30 years before I discussed
the camp.

49:27.731 --> 49:30.434 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just because of the shame that
you felt.

49:30.534 --> 49:32.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAS YAMASHITA: Yes.

49:32.402 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's my hope that people can really look at
this as saying, we can't isolate a group of

49:39.576 --> 49:41.812 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people just for who they are.

49:41.912 --> 49:46.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STUDENTS (singing): Don't suspect me because
I'm different.

49:47.084 --> 49:52.923 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for the Los Angeles Chorale,
this outreach is also about the power of art.

49:53.023 --> 49:57.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALICE KIRWAN MURRAY: It is important to us
certainly to engage young people in the creative

49:57.861 --> 50:01.965 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
arts, in performing arts, in choral arts.

50:02.065 --> 50:05.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is the first art form, really, just the
human voice.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We all possess this.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.808 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, for us to grab those students and let
them know that they have that ability, they

50:11.908 --> 50:15.746 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
have that power, it's the ultimate communication.

50:15.846 --> 50:30.994 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Van Nuys High School in
Los Angeles, I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS

50:31.094 --> 50:34.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

50:34.931 --> 50:48.912 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another in our Brief
But Spectacular series.

50:49.012 --> 50:55.185 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Tonight, attorney a longtime advocate for
criminal justice reform, shares his thought

50:55.285 --> 50:57.120 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on race and the legal system.

50:57.220 --> 50:59.623 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal Justice Initiative:
I was doing a hearing in the Midwest.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.158 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I had my suit and tie on.

51:01.258 --> 51:02.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was there early.

51:02.459 --> 51:04.494 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
It was the first time I had been in that courtroom.

51:04.594 --> 51:07.330 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I sat down at defense counsel's table,
as I always do.

51:07.431 --> 51:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the judge walked in.

51:09.366 --> 51:12.335 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the judge said: "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
you get back out there and you wait out there

51:12.436 --> 51:14.071 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in the hallway until your lawyer gets here.

51:14.171 --> 51:17.841 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I don't want any defendant sitting in my courtroom
without their lawyer."

51:17.941 --> 51:19.576 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I stood up and I said: "I'm sorry, Your
Honor.

51:19.676 --> 51:20.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I didn't introduce myself.

51:20.811 --> 51:22.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My name is BRYAN STEVENSON.

51:22.212 --> 51:24.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am the lawyer.

51:24.147 --> 51:28.985 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And the judge started laughing, and the prosecutor
started laughing, and I made myself laugh,

51:29.086 --> 51:30.887 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
because I didn't want to disadvantage my client.

51:30.987 --> 51:35.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, afterwards, I was thinking, what is it
that, when this judge saw a middle-aged black

51:35.759 --> 51:40.697 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
man, it didn't even occur to him that that
man sitting at defense counsel's table was

51:40.797 --> 51:41.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the lawyer?

51:41.798 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I worry about that judge.

51:43.233 --> 51:45.368 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I worry that he's sentencing defendants of
color more harshly.

51:45.469 --> 51:49.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I worry that he doesn't value and accept the
testimony of black and brown witnesses the

51:49.806 --> 51:51.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
way he does other people.

51:51.708 --> 51:55.979 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I worry that a narrative of racial difference
compromises his ability to provide fair and

51:56.079 --> 52:03.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
just treatment of all people.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.021 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I don't think we're free in America.

52:05.122 --> 52:08.658 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think we are burdened by our history of
racial inequality.

52:08.758 --> 52:13.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have a history of horrific mistreatmentof people based on color.

52:13.263 --> 52:18.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think that narrative of racial difference
that was cultivated to justify that mistreatment

52:18.301 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
has created a kind of smog, and we have all
been breathing it in.

52:21.271 --> 52:26.042 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If you read the 13th Amendment, it doesn't
talk about narratives of racial difference.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It doesn't talk about ideologies of white
supremacy.

52:28.879 --> 52:32.249 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It only talks about involuntary servitude
and forced labor.

52:32.349 --> 52:35.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, because of that, I don't think slavery
ended in 1865.

52:35.385 --> 52:38.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it just evolved.

52:38.188 --> 52:42.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We had decades of terrorism and violence where
black people were pulled out of their homes,

52:42.859 --> 52:47.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
burned alive, hung, beaten to death, sometimes
literally on the courthouse lawn, and we never

52:47.631 --> 52:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked about that.

52:49.266 --> 52:52.702 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And then we had this era of civil rights resistance
to racial segregation.

52:52.802 --> 52:56.973 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we have made progress, but we haven't
confronted the narrative of racial difference,

52:57.073 --> 53:01.745 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
unlike South Africa, where you are required
to hear about the damage done by apartheid,

53:01.845 --> 53:03.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unlike Germany.

53:03.747 --> 53:06.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Berlin, Germany, you can't go 100 meters
without seeing markers or stones or monuments

53:07.050 --> 53:10.820 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
placed near the homes of Jewish families abducted
during the Holocaust.

53:10.921 --> 53:13.723 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, in this country, we don't talk about
slavery.

53:13.823 --> 53:14.724 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We don't talk about lynching.

53:14.824 --> 53:15.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We don't talk about segregation.

53:16.092 --> 53:20.197 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And our silence has condemned us.

53:20.297 --> 53:23.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When I went to Harvard Law School, my first
year, I didn't want people to know I started

53:23.800 --> 53:25.502 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
my education in a colored school.

53:25.602 --> 53:28.872 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I didn't want them to know I was the great-grandson
of enslaved people.

53:28.972 --> 53:30.740 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I thought it might diminish me.

53:30.840 --> 53:37.914 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then I realized that my power, if I have
any, my strength, if I have any, my insight,

53:38.014 --> 53:41.851 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
if I have any, was shaped by those people
who survived slavery.

53:41.952 --> 53:47.390 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it's in that story of survival that I
think we have some greatness that we can offer,

53:47.490 --> 53:51.728 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and not just people of color, but all of uswho've learned to overcome.

53:51.828 --> 53:53.296 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My name is Bryan Stevenson.

53:53.396 --> 53:58.969 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And this is my Brief But Spectacular take
on justice in America.

53:59.069 --> 54:03.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch additional
episodes of Brief But Spectacular on our Web

54:03.707 --> 54:08.044 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

54:08.144 --> 54:11.281 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
On the "NewsHour" online right now: It's exciting.

54:11.381 --> 54:17.587 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NASA scientists say the waters swirling under
the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus may

54:17.687 --> 54:22.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
possess life-sustaining features previously
seen only on Earth.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.161 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
You can read all about their new findings.

54:25.262 --> 54:29.332 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
