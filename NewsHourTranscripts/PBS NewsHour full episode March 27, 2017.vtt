JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.374 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
Trump administration
attempts to move past last
week's health care

00:11.979 --> 00:16.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defeat, only to be struck by
mounting questions
over Russia connections.

00:16.850 --> 00:23.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Thousands take to the
streets in anti-government
protests across Russia, marking
the largest

00:23.924 --> 00:27.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show of defiance in recent
years.

00:27.127 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Turkey's economic freefall:
how political
upheaval and terrorism are
threatening the

00:33.200 --> 00:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nation's once thriving markets.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANSET BILGIN, Business Owner:
The city is
very quiet now.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tourists, they don't come.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The locals don't come, because
we're right
in the middle of the city, but
the bombings

00:43.610 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everything are not too far
from here,
so people are kind of scared.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, our
Politics Monday team
is here.

00:51.351 --> 00:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After last week's drama, who can
work with
whom, and for what?

00:55.989 --> 00:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.625 --> 01:03.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.096 --> 01:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Friday's failure
to get a House
vote on replacing Obamacare is
still reverberating

01:17.044 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

01:18.845 --> 01:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president and his team
are finding
it difficult trying to shift to
new topics.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We're not saying its the end of
health care,

01:26.787 --> 01:29.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think that we're looking
to look for
a way forward.

01:29.723 --> 01:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the White House
today, Press
Secretary Sean Spicer was the
public face

01:34.328 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the effort to move beyond the
humiliating
collapse of President Trump's
attempt to repeal

01:39.499 --> 01:41.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: What this event on
Friday did
was frankly draw more people
into the process

01:44.938 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to saying, OK, let's figure out
if we can
actually come together with some
consensus

01:49.242 --> 01:54.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideas to get to 218, whether or
not they come
from one side of the aisle or
the other.

01:54.214 --> 01:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But much of the day
was dominated
by mounting questions about the
House Intelligence

01:59.553 --> 02:04.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee chairman's revelation
that Trump
transition communications had
been intercepted.

02:05.025 --> 02:09.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Representative Devin
Nunes acknowledged
he got that information during a
meeting with

02:09.763 --> 02:14.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a source, not a White House
official, in the
Old Executive Office Building in
the White

02:14.434 --> 02:16.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House complex.

02:16.303 --> 02:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Spicer said he couldn't
say with certainty
that the White House wasn't the
source of

02:20.841 --> 02:22.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nunes' information.

02:22.642 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: What I can tell you
through his
public comments is that he has
said that he

02:26.480 --> 02:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had multiple sources that he
came to a conclusion
on.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to the degree to which any
of those sources
weighed on the ultimate outcome
of what he

02:33.920 --> 02:37.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came to a decision on, I don't
know.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something that,
frankly, I don't
even know that he discussed with
the president.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So it's possible, as
far as you
know right now?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SPICER: Well, anything --
anything is possible.

02:44.231 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, White
House officials
said the president's close
adviser and son-in-law

02:49.302 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner has volunteered to
meet with
the Senate Intelligence
Committee to talk

02:54.241 --> 02:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about meetings he arranged with
the Russian
ambassador during the
transition.

02:59.679 --> 03:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president sought to give the
appearance
of business as usual, signing
four bills into

03:04.418 --> 03:09.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law to roll back regulations put
in place
by the Obama administration.

03:09.222 --> 03:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he joined daughter Ivanka
and Vice President
Pence in a meeting with women
entrepreneurs.

03:16.863 --> 03:22.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aides said the president's next
major legislative
initiative will be an ambitious
overhaul of

03:22.669 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tax code, and this time the
White House
will be in charge.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Obviously, we're
driving the
train on this.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to -- I mean, we're
going to
work with Congress on this.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:35.015 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later this
afternoon, Senate
Democratic Leader Schumer said
Devin Nunes

03:39.986 --> 03:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be removed as chair of
the House Intelligence
Committee.

03:44.024 --> 03:49.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But House Speaker Paul Ryan said
through a
spokesman that he has full
confidence in Nunes.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Wall
Street fought
against fears that the health
care bill's

03:53.834 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collapse means trouble for the
Trump economic
agenda.

03:57.637 --> 04:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
dropped nearly
200 points at the outset, before
ending with

04:03.310 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a loss of 45 points to close
near 20551.

04:08.115 --> 04:13.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 11 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

04:13.653 --> 04:18.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's citizens who live
abroad began voting
today on dramatically expanding
President

04:18.992 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan's powers.

04:20.961 --> 04:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 2.5 million Turks were
eligible
to vote across Europe.

04:25.966 --> 04:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And political divisions were on
display, as
they turned out in France,
Germany and other

04:31.471 --> 04:33.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): This
is about
Turkey's future right now,
because they are

04:36.243 --> 04:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to change the republic or
democracy
into a dictatorship of one man.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm against that.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
sticking
together for Turkey and the
future of the

04:46.052 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Turkish republic.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a Turkish republic, and
we will say
yes all the way to the end.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are here to support the
stability of our
country.

04:53.059 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The referendum
has strained
relations between Turkey and
several European

04:57.864 --> 05:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states that barred Turkish
officials from
campaigning in their territory.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voting inside Turkey begins next
month.

05:05.972 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The major political parties in
Northern Ireland
will get several more weeks to
reach a new

05:10.777 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
power-sharing deal.

05:12.612 --> 05:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The British government extended
today's deadline
after negotiators failed to get
an agreement

05:17.651 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the weekend.

05:19.219 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Northern Ireland's
Catholic-Protestant unity
government collapsed in January.

05:24.090 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The alternative would be
returning the province
to direct rule by London.

05:29.095 --> 05:36.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Australia, a cyclone began
blasting its
way onshore early Tuesday, with
winds of 140

05:36.036 --> 05:37.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
miles an hour.

05:37.971 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The target was the northeastern
state of Queensland,
where the eye of the storm was
due to make

05:42.042 --> 05:44.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
landfall within hours.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People packed sandbags ahead of
the storm.

05:46.813 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And up to 30,000 people were
urged to evacuate
the coastal region.

05:51.651 --> 05:57.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And historian, journalist and
civil rights
activist Roger Wilkins died
Sunday, after

05:58.024 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suffering dementia.

05:59.926 --> 06:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilkins held a top civil rights
post in the
Lyndon Johnson administration
during the 1960s.

06:05.865 --> 06:10.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went on to write editorials
for The Washington
Post during the Watergate
scandal.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for years, he was a frequent
"NewsHour"
guest.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Roger Wilkins was 85 years old.

06:17.544 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
protests
across Russia galvanize Putin's
critics; claims

06:22.816 --> 06:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that scores of civilians have
been killed
by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq;
patients still

06:29.489 --> 06:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in limbo, wondering about the
future of the
Affordable Care Act; and much
more.

06:39.532 --> 06:45.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in limbo, wondering about the
future of the
Affordable Care Act; and much
more.

06:45.605 --> 06:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Widespread protests broke out in
cities across
Russia's 11 time zones yesterday
to denounce

06:52.245 --> 06:53.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government corruption.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

06:58.084 --> 07:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The sentence
for Kremlin
critic Alexei Navalny was handed
down this

07:03.590 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning in Moscow: 15 days in
jail for resisting
police.

07:09.396 --> 07:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was also fined 20,000 rubles,
about $350,
for organizing yesterday's mass
protests against

07:16.970 --> 07:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
alleged government corruption.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian
Opposition Leader
(through translator): I think
yesterday's

07:22.542 --> 07:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
events have shown there is a
large number
of voters in Russia who support
a candidate

07:26.313 --> 07:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who speaks for the fight against
corruption.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These people demand political
representation.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
demonstrations were the
biggest show of defiance against
President

07:34.821 --> 07:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin since 2012.

07:37.991 --> 07:43.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of thousands rallied in 99
cities, from
St. Petersburg and Moscow in the
west, to

07:43.730 --> 07:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chita in Siberia, to the far
Pacific coast
port of Vladivostok.

07:49.469 --> 07:55.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navalny generated the protests,
in part, to
demand the resignation of Prime
Minister and

07:55.742 --> 07:59.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
former President Dmitry
Medvedev.

07:59.045 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navalny released a video earlier
this month
showcasing myriad mansions,
yachts and vineyards

08:05.819 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Medvedev allegedly has amassed.

08:08.121 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds of protesters were
arrested yesterday
in Moscow and elsewhere.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the European Union called
for their
release.

08:16.863 --> 08:21.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Putin spokesman said: "The
Kremlin respects
people's civic stance and their
right to voice

08:21.534 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their position.

08:23.303 --> 08:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't express the same
respect to those
who consciously misled people
and provoked

08:27.841 --> 08:29.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illegal actions."

08:29.709 --> 08:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer said today:

08:32.145 --> 08:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The United States will monitor
the situation.

08:34.614 --> 08:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we call on the government of
Russia to
immediately release all peaceful
protesters.

MARGARET WARNER: For his part,
Navalny has
announced plans to challenge
Putin for president

08:44.157 --> 08:45.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2018.

08:45.692 --> 08:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his eligibility to do so is
in question
over previous criminal charges.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

08:53.366 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on the
protests, President
Putin, and where this goes from
here, I'm

08:58.705 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joined by journalist and author
Masha Gessen.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a contributing opinion
writer for The
New York Times.

09:04.878 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And among her books is a study
of the Russian
president titled "The Man
Without a Face:

09:10.517 --> 09:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir
Putin."

09:13.186 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she joins me from New York.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Masha Gessen, thank you very
much for joining
us.

09:17.791 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ninety-nine cities, the biggest
demonstrations
in five years, just how
significant was this?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN, The New York
Times: It's even
bigger than that.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just the biggest in
five years.

09:28.868 --> 09:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the first time since 1993
that Russians
have come out into the streets
without an

09:36.109 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explicit permission from the
government to
do so.

09:39.913 --> 09:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main difference between the
protests of
2011-2012 and these protests
today is that

09:45.819 --> 09:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they didn't have permits.

09:48.188 --> 09:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were -- the people who
were coming out
into the streets were very young
people, for

09:53.226 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most part, who knew that
they were all
risking arrest.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an extraordinary event.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You say young
people.

09:59.899 --> 10:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who are the people, mainly, who
turned out?

10:03.169 --> 10:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: Judging from the
video and photo
footage, from eyewitness
accounts and from

10:07.507 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the arrest records, this is the
youngest crowd
we have seen in the streets.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these people, most of
these people
are under 30.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of them are high
school students.

10:16.282 --> 10:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are people who have never
lived in Russia
without Putin.

10:20.587 --> 10:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of this had
to do with
this video of Medvedev, the
prime minister.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What -- why was that notable?

10:29.729 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What was it in that that
triggered this reaction?

10:32.699 --> 10:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: It's not just a
video.

10:35.802 --> 10:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a huge investigative
project carried
out by Alexei Navalny's
anti-corruption organization.

10:42.876 --> 10:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they put together a story,
and they put
together a film that
demonstrated and meticulously

10:49.949 --> 10:56.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
documented the scale of
corruption on the
part of Russia's prime minister,
Dmitry Medvedev.

10:56.856 --> 11:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what was it
about the scale
of corruption?

11:01.094 --> 11:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We mentioned some of it, the
houses, the extravagant...

11:04.864 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: The houses, the 50
pairs of
sneakers or however many he
orders every month.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The -- just, it's obscene.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that's a really
important
aspect of it.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just that he has a lot
of money.

11:19.812 --> 11:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that he behaves obscenely
with that amount
of money.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is sort of -- it is
unimaginable.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is unimaginable indecency.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it has been made public.

11:32.191 --> 11:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Given the level
of repression
in Russia, Masha Gessen, what do
protesters

11:37.597 --> 11:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think they can accomplish?

11:39.566 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: I don't think
these are protesters
who have a specific goal in
mind, as in, we're

11:46.105 --> 11:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to come out into the
streets and get
this done.

11:49.309 --> 11:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, again, these are
very young
people, so they may not be fully
aware of

11:55.381 --> 11:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the threat that they are facing.

11:57.517 --> 12:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last protests in Russia five
years ago
ended in a massive crackdown and
in dozens

12:03.489 --> 12:07.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
arrests of peaceful
demonstrators who went
to prison for years at a time.

12:07.627 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's likely that the
same fate
will face these young people.

12:12.999 --> 12:19.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they may even need a
greater crackdown
to put an end to these protests,
because these

12:19.339 --> 12:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are young people who don't watch
television
and who won't be quite as afraid
of jail,

12:24.110 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just because they are so young.

12:26.312 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I really fear is, if
these protests
continue, is the kind of
violence in the streets

12:32.218 --> 12:33.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we haven't seen before in
Russia.

12:33.886 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have
mentioned a couple
of times the threat that they
face.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, how real is the threat?

12:39.058 --> 12:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What could happen to these
people if they
continue to come out in the
streets?

12:42.862 --> 12:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: Well, what has
happened to protesters
in the past was that, basically,
the government

12:49.769 --> 12:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2012 put an end to a series
of mass protests
by changing laws, by making it
possible to

12:56.275 --> 13:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrest anybody for protests, and
by making
basically a show of imprisoning
not just protest

13:03.416 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders, and not specifically
protest leaders,
but activists, rank-and-file
protest participants.

13:09.489 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That gets across the idea that
anybody who
joins a protest without being an
organizer,

13:16.195 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without being a visible leader,
risks arrest,
and not risks just arrest, but
years in a

13:21.834 --> 13:23.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russian jail.

13:23.703 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you see
anything changing
about this regime as a result of
this level

13:27.874 --> 13:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of public distrust of this
government?

13:33.713 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: Well, yes and no.

13:37.050 --> 13:42.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're -- I mean, these
protesters came out
against corruption, which is a
little bit

13:42.255 --> 13:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different from coming out
against -- politically
against this regime.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Importantly, they were not
protesting the
war in Ukraine.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were not protesting the
murder of opposition
leaders.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were protesting corruption.

13:55.501 --> 14:01.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That does give the government an
opportunity
to take anti-corruption
measures, to fire

14:01.074 --> 14:06.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medvedev, to fire somebody else
who can be
accused of corruption, to make a
show of fighting

14:06.713 --> 14:07.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corruption.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

14:09.482 --> 14:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think these protesters at this
point are
stopping a little bit short of
demanding an

14:13.953 --> 14:17.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
end to the Putin regime.

14:17.890 --> 14:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their demands are not explicitly
political
nature.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are really demanding good
government.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that could change.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Masha Gessen,
journalist and
author, we thank you.

14:29.635 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MASHA GESSEN: Thank you.

14:33.406 --> 14:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A bombing in
Iraq by the
American-led military coalition
leaves scores

14:43.449 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A bombing in
Iraq by the
American-led military coalition
leaves scores

14:48.554 --> 14:49.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

14:51.390 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The airstrike took
place in the
Al Jadida neighborhood of
Western Mosul amid

14:56.229 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pitched fighting between ISIS
militants and
Iraqi government forces.

15:00.533 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reports from the scene are
gruesome, more
than 100 dead.

15:05.271 --> 15:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this incident and
the brutal battle
there, I'm joined from Irbil in
Northern Iraq

15:09.842 --> 15:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
via Skype by Loveday Morris of
The Washington
Post.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Loveday, thanks for joining us.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know it's very late there.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been 10 days since this
incident took
place.

15:19.986 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon said the air
assault took place
on March 17.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do we know about what
happened?

15:26.626 --> 15:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS, The Washington
Post: What
happened was, Iraqi forces were
advancing

15:30.229 --> 15:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the area at the time with
an ISIS-held
area.

15:36.169 --> 15:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one where residents say
that there
were a lot of ISIS fighters
fighting from

15:40.473 --> 15:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rooftops, and they were
sheltering in
their homes.

15:44.744 --> 15:49.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as the Iraqi forces
advanced, there was
heavy bombardment on this
neighborhood.

15:49.749 --> 15:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are allegations of
actually multiple
buildings hit by U.S.
airstrikes, but that

15:56.956 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one particular building where
they have pulled
out more than 100 bodies, 101
bodies now,

16:03.563 --> 16:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's an alleged site of
one of the strikes.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the Iraqis are
saying that
it was booby-trapped by ISIS.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: Yes, that's
right.

16:11.771 --> 16:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they have made an
initial investigation,
and this particular building was
booby-trapped

16:17.343 --> 16:18.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by ISIS.

16:18.711 --> 16:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, commanders blamed it
on an ISIS
car bomb, the collapse.

16:22.849 --> 16:26.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There have been several
conflicting stories.

16:26.385 --> 16:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi civil defense, the rescue
workers who
are pulling the bodies out of
the building,

16:31.657 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say they're experts in
building collapses,
and they say this was caused by
an airstrikes.

16:36.796 --> 16:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the U.S. coalition has said
that it carried
out a strike at the location of
accusations

16:42.635 --> 16:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of mass civilian casualties.

16:44.637 --> 16:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have seen this
fighting around
Mosul really intensify.

16:50.042 --> 16:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump had said he
wanted give commanders
in the field more flexibility.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we know about the rules
covering airstrikes
like these?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Have they changed since
President Trump came
into office?

17:00.953 --> 17:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: What we hear on
the U.S. side
and from the coalition is, no,
there's been

17:05.691 --> 17:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no change at all for the rules
of engagement
so far.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Iraqis are saying that as
well.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Official, there's no change to
the rules of
engagement.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There does seem to be some
speeding of the
process of calling in
airstrikes.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have made the process
faster.

17:18.905 --> 17:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have put U.S. forward air
controllers
closer to Mosul.

17:24.777 --> 17:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's really unclear what
exactly is causing
this.

17:29.315 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been a spike now
in civilian
casualty accusations both in
Iraq and Syria.

17:34.387 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And this is in Mosul,
some of the
most intense urban fighting,
street-to-street,

17:40.426 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
house-to-house.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the impact on the
civilian population?

17:43.429 --> 17:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: It's a huge
impact.

17:45.197 --> 17:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a huge amount of
ordnance flying
into that city, not just from
airstrikes,

17:50.002 --> 17:51.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but from artillery.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, obviously, ISIS also uses
heavy weaponry
and booby-traps.

17:54.807 --> 18:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, you talk to civilians
that are coming
out of Mosul, they have been in
their basements

18:01.147 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for weeks on end.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're absolutely terrified.

18:04.016 --> 18:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS are using their rooftops
and make them
keep their front doors open.

18:09.755 --> 18:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're very scared of
airstrikes on their
own houses while they're hiding
inside.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are coming out, and, yes,
a horrific
state.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's very little food, water
inside.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The area is under siege.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a terrible situation for
civilians.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Are they able to
flee?

18:26.172 --> 18:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: Some are.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Some aren't.

18:29.075 --> 18:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they normally can't flee
until the
Iraqi security forces get to
their area.

18:33.879 --> 18:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has happened, in some
cases, ISIS will
send a wave of civilians out.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will order them to leave
their homes.

18:43.723 --> 18:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqis will have to hold
fire if there's
a big wave of civilians coming
out.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It really slows them down.

18:49.729 --> 18:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, sometimes, people come out
like that.

18:53.099 --> 18:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other times, ISIS keep them in,
keeps them
blocked in their neighborhood to
use as human

18:58.304 --> 19:00.106 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shields.

19:00.139 --> 19:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in that case, I mean, any
time people
are coming out, they're always
caught in very

19:05.077 --> 19:06.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dangerous crossfire.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have snipers.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have mortars.

19:08.214 --> 19:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, it's tough for people to
get out, for
sure.

19:12.385 --> 19:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Loveday Morris, The
Washington
Post, from Irbil, thanks for
joining us, and

19:18.557 --> 19:20.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be safe.

19:20.926 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: Thank you.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:28.901 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Turkey's political
turmoil breeds economic
uncertainty for that

19:34.473 --> 19:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. ally; and it's Politics
Monday -- Amy
Walter and Tamara Keith survey
the landscape

19:40.846 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the collapse of the health
care bill.

19:43.349 --> 19:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: What's next for the
future of the
Affordable Care Act and the
consumers who

19:49.155 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are using it?

19:50.990 --> 19:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the Republican bill was
withdrawn on
Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan
said -- quote

19:55.194 --> 19:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "Obamacare remains the law of
the land
for now."

19:58.864 --> 20:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are problems that need
to be addressed.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama himself has said
so.

20:03.736 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 20 million people are
now getting
coverage through the insurance
marketplaces

20:08.808 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a Medicaid expansion.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins looks at the big
questions
ahead.

20:14.480 --> 20:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One major
issue: the health
of the marketplaces for
individuals who get

20:19.785 --> 20:21.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance on their own.

20:21.487 --> 20:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them, premiums rose by an
average of 25
percent this year.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's happening?

20:27.726 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In part, the exchanges need more
younger and
healthier adults to enroll.

20:32.331 --> 20:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our team has been fanning out
across the country
to hear about Americans'
concerns.

20:36.135 --> 20:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with a small business
in Salt Lake
City, and younger adults who are
not buying

20:41.173 --> 20:42.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage now.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICIA SMITH, Salt Lake City:
My name is
Patricia Smith.

20:44.677 --> 20:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm 33 years old, and I'm the
manager at Camp
Bow Wow.

20:48.747 --> 20:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the ACA, it was much more
reasonable
for me to be able to afford
insurance.

20:52.952 --> 20:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health care act came up, and
although
the first time when I applied, I
was able

20:57.289 --> 21:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get subsidies, when I filed
taxes at the
end of the year, they ended up
telling me

21:01.293 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, as a matter of fact, I
shouldn't have
been able to get subsidies, and
I had to pay

21:04.497 --> 21:06.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all of them back.

21:06.465 --> 21:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moving forward, from that point
on, I was
really not in a position to be
able to afford

21:09.768 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
health insurance anymore.

21:11.403 --> 21:16.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If I had chosen to get
insurance, the cost
of living for me would've
changed.

21:16.675 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My grocery bills, I wouldn't be
able to afford,
my gas, my mortgage.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It really would take a toll on
everything.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I definitely do worry about not
having insurance.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of what-ifs.

21:28.587 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even last year, I took a tumble
down the stairs
and ended up in an InstaCare.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's just a lot of
worries that go
with that.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN GARRETT, Salt Lake City:
I'm John Garrett.

21:37.563 --> 21:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm 24 years old, and I am a
front desk associate
here at Camp Bow Wow.

21:42.868 --> 21:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not very worried about not
having health
insurance at the moment, because
I'm pretty

21:47.239 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young, and I don't have that
much going on
with me.

21:50.442 --> 21:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if I can, you know, afford to
skip that
bill and save that, that much
money a month,

21:54.246 --> 21:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I definitely would prefer to do
that.

21:57.016 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did have to pay a penalty for
not having
health insurance.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the first year, it was about
$200.

22:02.788 --> 22:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that wasn't a big deal at
the time.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next year, I think it was
double, about
$400, and then the year after
that, it was

22:10.563 --> 22:12.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
$700.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA SMITH: I think it's a
little silly
for me to have to pay for
something that I

22:14.166 --> 22:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
simply can't afford anyways.

22:16.969 --> 22:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moving forward, if the law is
supposed to
change and we're able to afford
health insurance

22:21.040 --> 22:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we were able to get money
back and things
like that to pay for it, I would
love to put

22:25.277 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money in health insurance, so
that I don't
have to have the worry that I
have right now.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the same
time, there are
concerns about out-of- pocket
costs.

22:32.117 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's meet a woman in Ohio who
has a chronic
health problem and is grateful
for the coverage

22:36.622 --> 22:39.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she receives through the
Affordable Care Act.

22:39.225 --> 22:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was politically active in
opposing the
Republican bill, but says even
the current

22:43.529 --> 22:44.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law could be improved.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MINDY HEDGES, Radnor, Ohio: My
name is Mindy
Hedges.

22:47.666 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I live in Radnor, Ohio, Delaware
County.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And my age is 61.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, I'm a type 1 diabetic.

22:56.308 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been a type 1 diabetic
since the age
of 5.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That means a lot of medication.

23:03.282 --> 23:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I test myself, my blood
sugar, about six
to eight times a day.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a lot of medicines that I
need to take.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm on an insulin pump, very
expensive.

23:14.093 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My pharmaceuticals are about
$1,200 a month.

23:18.731 --> 23:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a -- my own company for 18
years, and
the recession hit and the
business closed.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I tried to get insurance and
couldn't.

23:27.906 --> 23:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody would cover me because I
have a preexisting
condition.

23:33.512 --> 23:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of the company that I talked
to me at
all about how much it would
cost, it was between

23:39.251 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$2,500 to $5,000.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even at that, they also
wouldn't cover
me

23:44.156 --> 23:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I was begging for -- people
were giving
me supplies.

23:52.498 --> 23:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a friend that worked in
the medical
field that was giving me insulin
and syringes.

23:58.704 --> 24:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: All these coverages just
wouldn't cover
me.

24:02.241 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MINDY HEDGES: I was waiting for
the Affordable
Care Act to come into to get
passed.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Finally, it did.

24:09.348 --> 24:10.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I was so thankful.

24:10.749 --> 24:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We pay a substantial amount, but
I still get
a subsidy for it.

24:15.854 --> 24:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, my payment right now is $445
a month.

24:20.693 --> 24:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not a system that --
that is that
is pure.

24:24.530 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that it has some
things that
need to be fixed.

24:29.101 --> 24:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if only we could just fix
them, instead
of coming up with something that
is so totally

24:36.041 --> 24:37.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
broken.

24:37.676 --> 24:40.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's a
sampling of the
concerns we heard across the
country.

24:40.145 --> 24:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's get our hands around what
exactly will
happen now with health care.

24:44.717 --> 24:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Problems remain, but how will
insurers and
all of us handle them?

24:48.454 --> 24:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mary Agnes Carey of Kaiser
Health News is
here to walk through some of
these issues.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you for joining us, Mary
Agnes.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health
News: Thanks
for having me.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's start
with something
President Trump said on Friday.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Listen.

24:59.565 --> 25:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I have been saying for the last
year-and-a-half

25:04.370 --> 25:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the best thing we can do,
politically
speaking, is let Obamacare
explode.

25:09.375 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is exploding right now.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many states have big problems.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Almost all states have big
problems.

25:17.483 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now, it's
obviously a piece
of rhetoric, but it is certainly
echoed around

25:20.486 --> 25:21.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

25:21.653 --> 25:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will just ask you right away:
Will Obamacare
explode?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that accurate?

25:26.425 --> 25:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And regardless of the answer of
at the question,
where are the real problems now?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: I don't think
it will explode.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are definitely some
problems with affordability.

25:33.165 --> 25:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned that average 25
percent increase
in the federal exchanges.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rural areas, the prices tend to
be higher.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Urban areas, the prices tend to
be lower.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it really depends on where
you live.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are insurers getting into that
market?

25:46.345 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much competition is there
between the
doctors and the hospitals, that
sort of thing,

25:50.315 --> 25:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the providers in the
marketplace?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there's a lot of variance.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me give you an example.

25:55.187 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For this year, in 2017, for one
of the plans
offered on the exchange, for a
40-year-old

25:59.525 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nonsmoker in Louisville,
Kentucky, it was
$229 a month.

26:04.196 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That same premium in Anchorage,
Alaska, was
$904, but this is before the
subsidies that

26:09.535 --> 26:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help eight in 10 people in the
exchanges lower
that price.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And so it seems
that rural
areas, Anchorage might be an
example, those

26:15.574 --> 26:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the ones where see the
biggest problems.

26:18.076 --> 26:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Congress, it seems, is not
planning to
do anything to repair the
system, at least

26:22.414 --> 26:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the foreseeable future.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But insurers have no choice.

26:24.616 --> 26:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have to take action.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the decisions facing
insurers coming
up soon?

26:28.821 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Sure.

26:30.622 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to decide by June --
it was May,
but the administration moved it
back because

26:34.059 --> 26:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all the uncertainty over the
health care
debate we have both been
covering on Capitol

26:37.696 --> 26:39.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

26:39.565 --> 26:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by May, they need to get --
by June, rather,
they need to get in their
premium estimates.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they will be looking at
their experience
in the market.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who are they covering?

26:46.472 --> 26:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How sick have these people been?

26:48.140 --> 26:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that the sickest folks
came in first.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're very, very expensive.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have thought that 25
percent premium
jump is going to be sort of a
one-time anomaly.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will that even out for 2018?

26:59.117 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the competition in the
marketplace?

27:00.853 --> 27:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are other insurers there looking
at their
risk pool, all the people
they're insuring?

27:05.557 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're trying to get a full
look everything.

27:08.494 --> 27:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will also be wondering
if the Trump
administration will enforce this
thing called

27:11.997 --> 27:13.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the individual mandate.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a requirement that most
Americans
have coverage or pay a fine.

27:17.202 --> 27:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Insurers like it because it
makes the healthy
and the sicker people get in.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Like the
younger people that
we heard mentioned in the piece.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Exactly.

27:24.743 --> 27:25.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was
obviously something
they were thinking about, that
penalty.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Right.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The question is
whether the
Trump administration will
actually force them

27:29.181 --> 27:30.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pay it.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Right, because
the younger
people tend to be healthier.

27:32.584 --> 27:36.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the more of those folks that
are in the
risk pool, the better off, the
lower the premiums,

27:36.688 --> 27:38.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
usually.

27:38.624 --> 27:39.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All right,
Republicans still
have the health and human
services secretary,

27:40.025 --> 27:41.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tom Price.

27:41.226 --> 27:42.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What power does he have?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or Hollywood decisions is he
thinking about
right now when it comes to the
Affordable

27:45.631 --> 27:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act and our health care
system?

27:47.132 --> 27:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Sure.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He could do some things
administratively.

27:49.968 --> 27:53.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have to remember the
Affordable Care Act
gives the health and human
services secretary

27:53.572 --> 27:55.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lots and lots of power.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could examine these things
called the essential
health benefits, those 10
categories that

27:59.378 --> 28:05.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
include maternity care,
emergency services,
mental health services, and
perhaps give insurers

28:05.250 --> 28:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little more flexibility over
whether or
not they have to offer those.

28:09.154 --> 28:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk about the Medicaid
program,
they may be a lot more open to
new approaches

28:15.294 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from states, including work
requirements for
the Medicaid beneficiaries.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And back to the Affordable Care
Act, there
is this other area of subsidies.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's premium subsidies.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's cost-sharing subsidies.

28:26.371 --> 28:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're part of a legal battle,
but the bottom
line is, the Trump
administration and Republicans

28:30.108 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Congress could decide not to
fund these.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 60 percent of people who
get help on
the exchanges get the
cost-sharing.

28:36.982 --> 28:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They help with the co-pays and
other out-of-pocket
deductibles.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they did, they would have
quite a problem
with the insurers.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And so to be
clear now, that
is not the general subsidies
people get to

28:45.924 --> 28:46.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get insurance.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: no.

28:48.794 --> 28:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That is help
for people to
pay when you get to the doctor,
your deductible

28:49.962 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and all of that.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: That's right,
your out-of-pocket.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the
Republicans could
decide not to provide that
money.

28:55.033 --> 28:58.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Insurers are worried, if
Republicans don't,
then they are going to have
people who don't

28:58.804 --> 28:59.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pay.

28:59.805 --> 29:00.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:00.806 --> 29:02.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: That's right.

29:02.107 --> 29:02.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they don't have the money,
they can't make
the deductible.

29:02.874 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can't make the co-pay.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they went ahead with
that, they could
have some pushback from the
insurers.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, briefly, I
guess, to
sum all this up, at the end of
the day, what

29:09.982 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should people be thinking about
and how much
-- what should people to watch
to see if their

29:14.653 --> 29:16.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life will change under health
care?

29:16.054 --> 29:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: First of all,
I think take
a breath.

29:18.090 --> 29:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been kind of confusing
for people,
all the fights on Capitol Hill,
what is happening.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look at your own health
insurance situation.

29:24.529 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're on the exchanges or
thinking about
them, as we head into fall with
the next open

29:28.367 --> 29:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enrollment period, see what your
options are.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Healthcare.gov is the electronic
marketplace.

29:34.072 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can get on healthcare.gov.

29:35.974 --> 29:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can work with a broker, an
insurance agent.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who's offering coverage?

29:39.244 --> 29:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is your current plan there?

29:40.679 --> 29:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are your providers covered?

29:42.080 --> 29:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's your total cost on your
premium and
your out-of-pocket?

29:44.883 --> 29:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A lot to be
watching for.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: A lot.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And I know you
will be watching
with us.

29:49.354 --> 29:52.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mary Agnes Carey, thank you so
much for joining
us.

29:52.090 --> 29:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.

29:59.798 --> 30:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turkey once
boasted that its
economy was the star of
so-called developing

30:07.305 --> 30:09.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
markets.

30:09.207 --> 30:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But political uncertainty and
increasing terrorism
from both ISIS and Kurdish
separatists have

30:13.745 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sent key economic numbers
tumbling, and ratings
agencies have slashed the
country's creditworthiness.

30:21.119 --> 30:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International concerns about
next month's
referendum, which could give
President Erdogan

30:25.791 --> 30:29.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
greater power, are also
contributing to the
economy's decline.

30:29.961 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a push to increase Islam's
place in public
life is driving some Turks to
consider leaving

Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Istanbul.

30:41.206 --> 30:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There's a touch
of desperation
about this sign, with its plea
for custom.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a message that resonates in
Turkey.

30:50.615 --> 30:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people in this cafe are tour
guides who've
swollen the ranks of the
unemployed.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Among them, Mert Taner.

30:57.823 --> 31:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERT TANER, Tour Guide: After
all those explosions
and terror attacks by al-Qaida,
ISIS, or PKK,

31:03.562 --> 31:09.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nearly 80 percent of the
Anglo-Saxon business,
which I'm personally involved in
it, people

31:09.634 --> 31:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from North America, Britain,
Australia, New
Zealand, they stopped coming to
Turkey.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The slump in
tourist numbers
is the worst ever.

31:18.310 --> 31:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheref Aral says that, after the
New Year's
Eve nightclub massacre, the
outlook has never

31:22.748 --> 31:24.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been more bleak.

31:24.583 --> 31:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEREF ARAL, Tour Guide: Every
bomb that has
happened, I have changed my plan
and adapted

31:30.088 --> 31:31.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it to the new situation.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But every plan that I did
collapsed again
one more time.

31:35.026 --> 31:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORGAN FREEMAN, Actor: If you
are one of us,
and you want to explore more of
this great

31:42.100 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planet, we are ready to take you
there.

31:43.869 --> 31:47.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Turkish
Airlines aired this
ad at the Super Bowl, following
losses of

31:47.339 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$463 million in the first nine
months of 2016,
after turning an $877 million
profit the previous

31:54.479 --> 31:55.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MORGAN FREEMAN: Turkish
Airlines.

31:58.650 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Tourism
contributes about
10 percent towards Turkey's
overall national

32:03.855 --> 32:05.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

32:05.657 --> 32:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a barometer of confidence
in the country
and crucial for foreign currency
earnings.

32:10.495 --> 32:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody is buying at Ertap
Tepeyurt's jewelry
store in one of Istanbul's most
popular arcades.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he refuses to believe the
economy is permanently
hobbled.

32:20.005 --> 32:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERTAP TEPEYURT, Turkey (through
translator):
Every downturn is followed by an
upturn.

32:25.043 --> 32:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A large company may collapse,
and then it
may take a long time to recover.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our hope is that things will
eventually be
alright.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, because of this expectation,
we need to
be more patient.

32:34.653 --> 32:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Turkey briefly
benefited
from the misfortunes of Tunisia
and Egypt,

32:39.357 --> 32:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose tourist industries have
been wrecked
by terrorism.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the impact of contagion is
plain to see.

32:45.263 --> 32:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And restaurant worker Levent
Demir is hoping
for an antidote.

32:48.733 --> 32:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEVENT DEMIR, Turkey (through
translator):
First of all, for things to get
better, Syria

32:52.604 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is critical.

32:54.472 --> 32:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Order needs to be restored in
Syria, because
Turkey is suffering from what's
going on Syria.

32:58.944 --> 33:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The circle of fire around us
needs to be extinguished.

33:01.580 --> 33:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: To make matters
worse, Turkish
ports won't be welcoming cruise
liners this

33:06.418 --> 33:08.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

33:08.119 --> 33:12.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Terrorism and political
uncertainty have led
ratings agencies like Standard &amp;
Poor and

33:12.224 --> 33:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fitch to relegate the country to
the lowest
investment grades.

33:18.163 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an attempt to bolster the
Turkish currency,
the lira, President Erdogan made
people's

33:22.767 --> 33:24.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
savings an issue of patriotism.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Recently, they
started a row

33:27.539 --> 33:28.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on foreign currencies.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say dollar is spiked
against the lira.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This much, that much, it doesn't
matter.

33:33.778 --> 33:37.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to remind my people, my
dear people,
I love you.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who keep foreign currency
under their
pillow should come and turn that
into Turkish

33:40.886 --> 33:42.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lira or gold.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let Turkish lira gain value.

33:44.289 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan has never
been reticent about using the
term terrorist.

33:49.361 --> 33:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he did so after the Turkish
currency dived
against the U.S. dollar earlier
this year.

33:54.132 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, you know that the
economy is being
manipulated by those whose
objective is to

33:58.870 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attack Turkey.

34:00.705 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said there is no difference
at all between
a terrorist who has a weapon in
his hand and

34:04.943 --> 34:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a terrorist who has a dollar or
euro in his
pocket.

34:08.313 --> 34:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They, he said, use currency as a
weapon.

34:11.683 --> 34:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey's president is bolstered
by cheerleaders
in the press.

34:15.487 --> 34:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among them, Abdurrahman Dilipak,
a columnist
with an Islamist tabloid
newspaper who we

34:20.325 --> 34:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
met in the executive suite a at
the Istanbul
Stock Exchange.

34:24.162 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He believes there's
international backing
for FETO, an organization
accused by Turkey

34:29.267 --> 34:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of orchestrating last summer's
coup attempt
against President Erdogan.

34:33.038 --> 34:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDURRAHMAN DILIPAK, Columnist
(through translator):
We know that behind this FETO
movement there

34:36.942 --> 34:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the United States, the CIA,
the RAND Corporation.

34:40.745 --> 34:45.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, there is the Vatican,
Germany, Israel,
England, and France.

34:45.383 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We know.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, in that respect,
manipulation of the
economy must be acknowledged.

34:50.855 --> 34:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only natural that there
should be turbulence
in a country which is just
recovering from

34:55.026 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a coup attempt.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some people are fanning the
flames.

34:58.663 --> 35:01.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, this is immoral and
unacceptable.

35:01.232 --> 35:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UMIT AKCAY, Economist: Ordinary
people feel
that they need more economic
stability.

35:07.005 --> 35:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But economist
Umit Akcay
says the key numbers affecting
ordinary people

35:11.977 --> 35:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going the wrong way, like
unemployment,
which now affects 12 percent of
the population.

35:16.681 --> 35:23.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UMIT AKCAY: Inflation is
increasing, and,
at the same time, the
unemployment rate is

35:23.555 --> 35:25.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increasing.

35:25.390 --> 35:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's especially bad for the
young people,
because the young unemployment
rate is about

35:29.627 --> 35:31.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 percent.

35:31.563 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2017, almost all data shows
that this trend
will continue.

35:37.802 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan insists
that foreign funds continue to
flow into Turkey,

35:42.440 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but other financial experts
believe that continuing
political uncertainty will lead
to capital

35:47.479 --> 35:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flight, as happened in Greece,
with the wealthy
moving their money abroad.

35:53.051 --> 35:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gokhan Karahan is a consultant
at the sharp
end of this process, as he helps
Turks to

35:57.889 --> 36:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buy property in countries that
will grant
them residency, such as
neighboring Greece.

36:02.660 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOKHAN KARAHAN, Consultant: I am
having more
people that they just need a
plan B. There's

36:07.799 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a growing concern about their
children.

36:11.669 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Especially young women who have
small children
who were raised with secular
ideas, they're

36:17.809 --> 36:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much concerned about the
future of their
country.

36:20.879 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to have some sort of a
guarantee
for their future.

36:24.049 --> 36:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYSER ALI, Literary Agent: I
just feel surrounded
by people that I don't share
anything with.

36:31.923 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Literary agent
Ayser Ali
is alarmed by what she sees as
Turkey's growing

36:37.162 --> 36:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abandonment of Western values
and is joining
the steady trickle of educated
young professionals

36:42.434 --> 36:44.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quietly slipping abroad.

36:44.235 --> 36:52.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYSER ALI: I'm really sorry to
see how hard
it is to build a good society
with values,

36:52.644 --> 36:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how easy it is to destroy it
in a very,
very short time.

36:56.614 --> 37:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Ayser Ali is
packing up her
books to give to friends before
moving to

37:01.052 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYSER ALI: The only thing we can
do is just
to try somewhere else.

37:06.724 --> 37:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I always had even a little spark
of hope all
the time.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But now it's over.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Janset
Bilgin isn't leaving.

37:17.335 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For six years, she ran a small
jewelry and
furniture store.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When business slumped, she
decided she either
had to close up or invest.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She gambled and transformed it
into a cafe.

37:27.312 --> 37:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANSET BILGIN, Business Owner: I
know the
timing is really bad because the
city is very

37:30.715 --> 37:32.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quiet now.

37:32.217 --> 37:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tourists, they don't come.

37:34.018 --> 37:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The locals don't come, because
we're right
in the middle of the city, but
the bombings

37:37.856 --> 37:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everything are not too far
from here,
so people are kind of scared.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really don't see a hopeful
future.

37:44.095 --> 37:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, on the other hand, we love
our country
and don't want to go anywhere.

37:48.166 --> 37:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan insists
that Turkey is a safe haven for
foreign investment.

37:52.937 --> 37:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But financial experts warn that
Turkey can't
afford economic or political
missteps.

37:58.209 --> 38:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fear the present course
will only increase
the country's financial
troubles.

38:03.114 --> 38:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Istanbul.

38:10.488 --> 38:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are a
number of questions
facing Republicans in Washington
right now,

38:23.034 --> 38:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the failure to pass a
health care bill,
to the investigation into Russia
and the Trump

38:27.739 --> 38:29.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

38:29.541 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look now at what's next for
the majority
party with our Politics Monday
duo, Tamara

38:33.745 --> 38:38.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello to both of you.

38:39.884 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start with what --
Tam, with what
the speaker said last Friday in
trying to

38:44.122 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explain why this whole thing
fell apart.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, we haven't learned to
be the majority
party.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We haven't learned how to lead.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're still stuck in the
opposition.

38:53.498 --> 38:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does that sound like the right
description
of what went wrong?

38:57.735 --> 38:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And can -- is that something
they can learn?

38:59.204 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It certainly
is a description.

39:01.472 --> 39:05.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out that winning
doesn't paper over
all of the divisions that were
there a year

39:06.010 --> 39:10.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago or two years ago or three
years ago within
the Republican Party.

39:10.815 --> 39:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those divisions came out
into bright focus
with this bill.

39:15.887 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The reality is that they
actually have a smaller
majority than they did last
year, and they

39:23.094 --> 39:27.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were not able to send that many
bills to President
Obama's desk to veto.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now they have a president of
their own party.

39:29.734 --> 39:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one congressman said, it's
like going from
playing fantasy football to
playing real football.

39:33.805 --> 39:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is after
months and
months, Tam, of talking about
the fact that

39:40.178 --> 39:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were going to undo this.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was their principal goal
during this
campaign.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the thing that they
talked about.

39:48.686 --> 39:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the thing they have been
talking about
for seven years.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They only worked on it for 18
days.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they were like, well,
moving on.

39:56.761 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now it seems like maybe they
are holding
open the possibility of maybe
coming back

40:02.133 --> 40:03.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to it.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, what's your
take?

40:04.802 --> 40:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something Republicans
can learn how
to be, in the majority, in
charge?

40:06.604 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
I think Tam summed it up pretty
well.

40:11.142 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact they only spent 18 days
on something
is issue number one.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second is, of course, that
two-thirds
of the members in the House
right now who

40:19.651 --> 40:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are Republicans have never been
with a Republican
president, so this is a
brand-new situation

40:25.089 --> 40:26.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these divisions, I would
argue, within
the Republican Party have been
around longer

40:31.029 --> 40:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the last couple of years.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been around for 10 or
12 years.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is a lot to overcome.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the other thing we
learned, though,
was that Donald Trump's style,
which worked

40:39.904 --> 40:44.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaign trail, the let's
just rally
and take one for the team, I can
bring the

40:44.575 --> 40:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team together in a campaign,
didn't work in
a legislative sense.

40:49.280 --> 40:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not enough to just say,
hey, members
of my own party, vote for
something that's

40:54.085 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really unpopular.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't really talk to you about
the details
of this policy.

40:58.022 --> 41:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not ideologically attached
to this piece
of legislation.

41:01.859 --> 41:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't even tell you that I
want to spend
a whole lot of time selling this
legislation,

41:06.497 --> 41:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but vote for it because you like
me.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what his party said was,
that's not enough.

41:10.902 --> 41:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a really important factor
as we go forward
to whatever the next piece of
legislation

41:16.708 --> 41:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this Congress wants to get
through.

41:18.676 --> 41:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The power of persuasion of this
president
isn't enough, even though he
remains popular

41:24.148 --> 41:25.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
among his own base.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Tam, I mean, this brings to
mind, while
the Republicans are trying to
figure out what

41:30.388 --> 41:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can get done, meanwhile,
the president
was saying to Democrats, hey,
I'm looking

41:35.393 --> 41:36.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for your ideas.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Come up -- let me know what you
think.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to -- I'm ready to deal
with you.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are Democrats going to follow up
on that?

41:42.934 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, that's a
good question.

41:44.836 --> 41:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This president has a pretty
remarkable ability,
going back to when he was in
business, to

41:49.073 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reframe defeats as wins.

41:52.276 --> 41:56.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So he had four business
bankruptcies and he
found a way to say that those
are actually

41:56.781 --> 41:58.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wins for him.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so now he has taken this.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is a huge political
defeat.

42:02.587 --> 42:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, maybe that's better
because now
I can work two Democrats.

42:06.991 --> 42:11.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear at this point the
Democrats
are really interested in handing
him a win.

42:11.863 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there will come things
like whether
there is a government showdown,
and there

42:16.501 --> 42:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could come a time when Democrats
will possibly
throw a life preserver to avoid
being blamed

42:22.407 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for shutting the government
down, but we aren't
there yet.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, Tam is right.

42:28.346 --> 42:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the question really is,
what incentive
do Democrats have to work with
this president?

42:32.884 --> 42:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Right now, he has done nothing.

42:35.153 --> 42:39.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, actually, he hasn't done
anything throughout
his time as a candidate or as a
president

42:39.891 --> 42:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reach out to anybody, besides
the people
who already support him.

42:43.694 --> 42:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, after a defeat, he's
going to come
to them and ask for their help?

42:47.698 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have much incentive
to do that.

42:50.435 --> 42:55.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a president right now
sitting at somewhere
around 41 percent approval
rating, if you

42:55.673 --> 42:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put all the averages of the
polls together.

42:58.443 --> 43:03.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even for red state Democrats,
they don't see
a whole lot to fear either from
crossing him.

43:03.981 --> 43:09.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And more important, for
Democrats, the Democratic
base is energized.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are angry.

43:11.055 --> 43:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are telling pollsters
the number
one thing they're concerned
about is their

43:15.326 --> 43:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own party's members compromising
with this
president.

43:18.629 --> 43:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the president has really
boxed himself
into a corner.

43:22.633 --> 43:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He needs his people to support
him.

43:25.436 --> 43:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just being rah-rah, team
player, sing
to my base isn't enough to get
them.

43:31.209 --> 43:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boxed himself
into a corner,
Tam, and at a moment when he
needs a win.

43:35.580 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would like to have -- get
something up
on the board.

43:39.016 --> 43:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much is he politically set
back by what
happened last week?

43:42.820 --> 43:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: This is a very big
setback legislatively.

43:45.456 --> 43:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to do things that are
sort of small
ball, little chippy wins that
he's going to

43:50.728 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do in the coming days.

43:51.729 --> 43:52.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chippy?

43:53.030 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, he's going to
sign some
executive orders.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not a long drive down
the fairway.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are little chips.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is going to sign some
executive orders.

44:00.104 --> 44:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going to do what he's been
doing.

44:01.606 --> 44:05.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But in terms of legislation,
that's much harder.

44:05.443 --> 44:08.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they're saying that they
want to move
to tax reform.

44:08.713 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tax reform is not the easy thing
you go to
after health care.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tax reform, they haven't done
that in 30 years.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, not the
easiest thing.

44:18.122 --> 44:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, it's not the
easiest thing.

44:20.358 --> 44:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before that -- Tam alluded
to this, but
we have something at the end of
April where

44:24.762 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the government funding runs out.

44:26.531 --> 44:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we may be back in the
situation where
we're talking about a potential
government

44:30.268 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
showdown.

44:32.103 --> 44:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, we're talking about some
fissures within
the Republican Party over issues
like Planned

44:35.039 --> 44:36.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Parenthood.

44:36.908 --> 44:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Democratic side,
there is going
to be a big pushback on the
inclusion of money

44:41.178 --> 44:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for building that infamous wall
on the border.

44:44.148 --> 44:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we could be talking about
not about tax
reform in the next couple of
weeks, but about

44:48.920 --> 44:50.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government showdown.

44:50.288 --> 44:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is going to be the next
real big hurdle
for this president.

44:53.291 --> 44:59.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he could get, with the
Supreme Court
nomination, a pretty significant
win under

44:59.430 --> 45:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his belt before then, but that's
also going
to be really messy.

45:02.767 --> 45:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, before
I let you
two go, I have to ask you about
the other

45:05.603 --> 45:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story that is the talk of
Washington today,
has to do, Tam, with the
chairman of the House

45:11.642 --> 45:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence Committee, Devin
Nunes, who is
the center of a lot of attention
because of

45:16.714 --> 45:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his claim or story last week
that he had information
-- he doesn't say where it came
from.

45:22.753 --> 45:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was at the White House when
he got this
information that he says
indicates that the

45:27.825 --> 45:34.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president and people around him
were surveilled,
under surveillance during the
transition.

45:34.265 --> 45:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said it has nothing to do
with the
Russia investigation.

45:38.703 --> 45:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of all this?

45:40.638 --> 45:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And he's really
saying that
they were caught up in other
routine and completely

45:43.574 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legal surveillance.

45:45.109 --> 45:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very curious story.

45:47.945 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Devin Nunes keeps talking
and talking
and talking.

45:51.515 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every time he talks, it
almost becomes
less clear than it was before.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy?

45:57.154 --> 45:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD+IT /MD-IT /AMY WALTER: Yes,
that's
exactly right.

45:58.990 --> 46:05.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, though, this is
putting a lot
of pressure on Republicans to
make a statement

46:05.563 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this, whether or not he
can be considered
a credible chair of this
committee, whether

46:12.136 --> 46:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not he has to recuse himself
from this.

46:14.538 --> 46:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Schumer has already come
out today
saying he should actually step
down as chair

46:18.643 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Intelligence Committee.

46:20.378 --> 46:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is this big, swirling
black cloud.

46:23.581 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those of you who enjoyed the
show "Lost,"
you might remember there was
this big amorphous

46:28.352 --> 46:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cloud that would show up out of
nowhere and
spread destruction.

46:32.823 --> 46:36.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's what this issue of
Russia and surveillance
has become.

46:36.861 --> 46:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just pops up, and it
continues to just
distract the administration, and
really push

46:43.801 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them off course.

46:44.835 --> 46:46.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it has put Nunes into a
terrible position.

46:46.771 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of pressure coming
on Republicans
in these coming days about
whether their chairman

46:51.242 --> 46:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can stay in his current role.

46:53.811 --> 46:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're all madly
searching for
analogies, black cloud, black
mass.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Black smoke.

46:59.283 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Black smoke
covers it all.

47:01.919 --> 47:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith,
Politics Monday,
thank you both.

47:05.389 --> 47:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

47:10.061 --> 47:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

47:14.732 --> 47:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally: a
reexamination of
a couple whose story has been
made even more

47:23.474 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relevant for our time.

47:25.543 --> 47:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

47:28.746 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The most famous
couple in history,
that's one way of looking at
Adam and Eve,

47:33.617 --> 47:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but a useful one if you're
seeking lessons
in their story that continue to
resonate into

47:38.489 --> 47:39.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our own time.

47:40.024 --> 47:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the tag taken in "The
First Love Story:
Adam, Eve, and Us."

47:44.428 --> 47:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Author Bruce Feiler writes
widely on biblical
and other issues.

47:47.565 --> 47:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was writer and host of
the PBS series
"Walking the Bible" and "Sacred
Journeys."

47:52.436 --> 47:54.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

47:54.138 --> 47:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER, Author, "The First
Love Story:
Adam, Eve, and Us": Nice to be
here.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wasn't sure
what I was opening
up.

47:57.141 --> 47:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I expected to see something
about the Bible
and archaeology.

47:59.810 --> 48:01.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I did.

48:01.378 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But you also write about
yourself, about relationships,
about modern technology.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were you after in looking
at their story?

48:06.884 --> 48:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: What happened to
me was, we
were on a trip to Rome as a
family.

48:10.921 --> 48:13.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we -- I took my daughters
into the Sistine
Chapel.

48:13.491 --> 48:14.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm like, listen up, girls.

48:14.492 --> 48:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to blow your mind.

48:15.826 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:17.595 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: And one of them
looks up and
sees Adam and God sailing across
the skies.

48:19.463 --> 48:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The famous moment
where they're
touching.

48:21.265 --> 48:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: The famous moment,
and says,
well, you know, where am I in
that picture,

48:25.202 --> 48:26.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

48:26.370 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is from the point of view
of an 8-year-old
girl.

48:28.105 --> 48:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And her sister points out
something I had
never seen before, which is Eve
underneath

48:32.376 --> 48:33.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
God's arm.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she says, you know, is that
Eve?

48:35.346 --> 48:37.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's just when it hit me.

48:37.114 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realized, for 3,000 years,
this story
has been at the heart of every
conversation

48:40.918 --> 48:42.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about men, women and sex.

48:42.419 --> 48:46.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I wanted to understand
today, maybe
I needed to understand them.

48:46.257 --> 48:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as absurd as it sounds, I
asked myself,
might Adam and Eve be the role
models that

48:51.395 --> 48:53.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we are looking for?

48:53.197 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, OK,
before we -- go
back to the original Adam and
Eve, because

48:55.866 --> 48:56.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you had to, right?

48:56.867 --> 48:57.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE FEILER: Yes.

48:57.868 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, exactly.

48:59.270 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got the original story
that appears
in the text in Genesis.

49:03.207 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what you have is
organized religion
sort of glomming onto the story
and entirely

49:09.547 --> 49:10.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reinterpreting it.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And by organized religion, I
mean men.

49:12.483 --> 49:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that what you have
here is a situation
where Adam and Eve, but
especially Eve, are

49:16.520 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
victims of the greatest
character assassination
the world has ever known.

49:21.458 --> 49:27.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Basically, the story was
weaponized as a way
to elevate men and to hurt
women.

49:27.398 --> 49:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you go back to the story,
that's not what
you find.

49:30.067 --> 49:32.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, I think the first
thing, just
to sort of set the stage briefly
here, is,

49:33.003 --> 49:34.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you have got two stories.

49:34.104 --> 49:36.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The second story is more famous,
right?

49:36.640 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's -- you have got Adam
being created
from the earth, Eve being
created Adam, the

49:40.611 --> 49:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fruit and getting kicked out of
Eden.

49:42.613 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the first story is very
different, because,
in the first story, you have got
man and woman

49:47.418 --> 49:49.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being created in the image of
God.

49:49.587 --> 49:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's true for one is true for
the other.

49:51.455 --> 49:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole story begins in
equality.

49:54.491 --> 49:56.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what got lost in all
these interpretations.

49:56.327 --> 50:00.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
central tenets of
your book is that humans were
meant to be

50:00.064 --> 50:01.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together, right?

50:01.065 --> 50:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE FEILER: Yes.

50:02.266 --> 50:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But this is a
model for looking
at love.

50:04.201 --> 50:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Give me an example for our
audience to understand
what it is you're -- how you're
bringing their

50:08.205 --> 50:10.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
story up to our own time.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: In every other
story that comes
before, you have got a God, and
a God creating

50:13.811 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
humans, or a God and a human.

50:15.813 --> 50:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The biblical story represents a
revolution
in thought.

50:18.482 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first story that has a
man and woman
at the start of the human line.

50:21.952 --> 50:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have to succeed in order
for us to succeed.

50:25.155 --> 50:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, why are they a model?

50:26.490 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, look, they begin
together, and then
Eve grows Bored.

50:29.927 --> 50:30.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She wants autonomy.

50:30.928 --> 50:31.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She wants independence.

50:31.929 --> 50:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She goes and she eats the fruit.

50:33.030 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She comes back.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She gives Adam a choice.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has to decide, what do I
do?

50:38.002 --> 50:38.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He chooses her.

50:39.003 --> 50:39.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They leave Eden.

50:39.970 --> 50:40.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They could separate.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They stay together and have
children.

50:42.072 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of them murders the other.

50:43.741 --> 50:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They reconcile and have a third.

50:45.609 --> 50:48.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of my
colleagues was looking
at the book today, and he said
-- and I said

50:48.612 --> 50:49.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what I was doing.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, you know, this
story doesn't
end well, right?

50:51.949 --> 50:52.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's the fall.

50:52.950 --> 50:54.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's the banishment.

50:54.618 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's all this trouble.

50:55.619 --> 50:57.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is that a model?

50:57.288 --> 51:00.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE FEILER: It ends
brilliantly, because
most people think it ends in
Eden.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, they have -- they become
parents.

51:02.026 --> 51:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't go well with Cain and
Abel.

51:04.428 --> 51:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could be the end of the
story.

51:06.163 --> 51:07.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They reconcile, have a third
child.

51:07.765 --> 51:08.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's incredibly inspirational.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what I think the lessons
are?

51:10.100 --> 51:13.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Number one, constancy,
stick-to-itiveness,
right?

51:13.237 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The modern psychologists tell us
that you
have to mend relationships.

51:17.107 --> 51:18.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the most important thing.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

51:20.144 --> 51:23.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then there's also this
incredible balance
in the story, this mix of
independence and

51:23.147 --> 51:24.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interdependence.

51:24.949 --> 51:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's incredibly powerful today
that didn't
happen again until we
re-equalized Eve in

51:29.086 --> 51:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the last couple of decades.

51:30.988 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to me, the biggest idea
that I have learned
-- I basically went in to write
a book about

51:33.857 --> 51:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adam and Eve, ended up writing a
book about
love.

51:36.226 --> 51:37.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did I learn?

51:37.428 --> 51:39.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Love is a story you tell with
another person.

51:39.763 --> 51:40.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

51:40.764 --> 51:42.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's co-creation through
co-narration.

51:42.232 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what Adam and Eve
embody.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what do we learn from them?

51:47.538 --> 51:51.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hit a bump in the road,
you have
a rupture, you add a new chapter
to your story.

51:51.909 --> 51:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the first to tell a
story together
and to recognize you need both.

51:57.982 --> 52:00.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Theirs is the first joint
byline.

52:00.651 --> 52:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a very powerful
lesson for today.

52:02.686 --> 52:06.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The question you
ask here is,
can Adam and Eve be role models
for relationships

52:06.824 --> 52:07.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

52:07.825 --> 52:09.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the answer, apparently, is
yes.

52:09.093 --> 52:11.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: I believe deeply
and profoundly.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more than that, I think that
we need the
story to work.

52:14.031 --> 52:18.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At this moment, when
relationships are commodities,
and we let each other down, and
our society

52:18.102 --> 52:21.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is being frayed -- we all know
that -- we
need our first story to be one
of success.

52:21.672 --> 52:26.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, essentially, what I'm saying
to people
is, if you care about men and
women and their

52:26.510 --> 52:29.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship, if you want to
strengthen and
deepen your own relationship, if
you're interested

52:29.947 --> 52:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in love or religion, come on
this journey.

52:32.049 --> 52:34.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, as you have said here,
you will be
surprised.

52:34.318 --> 52:35.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will learn something.

52:35.853 --> 52:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in the end, I think you
will be uplifted,
because this story works.

52:39.256 --> 52:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, we need stories that
work at the
heart of our culture.

52:42.626 --> 52:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is "The
First Love
Story: Adam, Eve, and Us."

52:46.063 --> 52:48.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bruce Feiler, thank you very
much.

52:48.065 --> 52:53.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUCE FEILER: It's an honor.

52:53.470 --> 52:55.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.
