JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.767 --> 00:06.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.767 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.833 --> 00:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: I will get
rid of and totally destroy the

00:11.967 --> 00:14.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Johnson amendment.

00:14.567 --> 00:18.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump vows to drastically
change the way church
and state are separated

00:19.267 --> 00:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during political campaigns.

00:21.333 --> 00:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then: what we know
about a deadly raid by
Navy SEALs in Yemen.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Details emerge from the
dangerous counterterrorism
operation against al-Qaida.

00:33.433 --> 00:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we travel to a
corner of Kentucky where
many people depend on
Obamacare to hear their

00:38.633 --> 00:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thoughts on the possibility
of repeal and replace.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY OLLER, Obamacare
Enrollment Official:
Some people feel that
because Trump's in office,

00:44.733 --> 00:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why do we have to have
it, because they're hoping
they don't get fined.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and
more on tonight's "PBS NewsHour"

00:56.967 --> 00:59.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.733 --> 01:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From prayer
breakfast to biker heaven, the
president spent this day talking

01:09.533 --> 01:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about religion,
politics, trade and more.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:15.833 --> 01:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, President
Trump revved up his new
administration with a
visit from Harley-Davidson

01:21.800 --> 01:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executives and workers.

01:23.933 --> 01:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Boy, would you
like to see me fall off these

01:26.667 --> 01:27.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things?

01:27.667 --> 01:30.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Would that be a story?

01:30.367 --> 01:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And used the annual
National Prayer Breakfast to
reignite a campaign promise,

01:37.833 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vowing to change the tax
code to allow churches
and other tax-exempt
groups to openly campaign

01:41.567 --> 01:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for political candidates.

01:43.567 --> 01:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will get rid
of and totally destroy the
Johnson amendment and allow our

01:49.567 --> 01:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
representatives of faith
to speak freely and without
fear of retribution.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will do that.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Remember.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:59.767 --> 02:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The provision wasn't
controversial when then-senator
Lyndon Johnson introduced

02:05.200 --> 02:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it and President Dwight
Eisenhower signed
it into law in 1954.

02:08.633 --> 02:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now some religious leaders,
especially conservative
Christians, say it
violates their freedom

02:14.233 --> 02:16.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of speech.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking at the
breakfast, Mr. Trump also
defended his immigration
order against critics

02:19.367 --> 02:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who say it's a ban on Muslims.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: In the coming
days, we will develop a system
to help ensure that those

02:28.033 --> 02:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
admitted into our country
fully embrace our values of
religious and personal liberty,

02:32.833 --> 02:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that they reject any form of
oppression and discrimination.

02:39.733 --> 02:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want people to come into
our nation, but we want people
to love us and to love our

02:45.633 --> 02:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
values, not to hate us
and to hate our values.

02:49.033 --> 02:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There were also
lighter moments, as when
the president suggested
divine intervention

02:55.533 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the current incarnation of
his TV show, "The Apprentice."

02:58.100 --> 03:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: They hired
a big, big movie star,
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
to take my place.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we know how that turned out.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The ratings went
right down the tubes.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been a total disaster.

03:11.467 --> 03:15.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I want to just pray
for Arnold, if we can,
for those ratings, OK?

03:15.367 --> 03:17.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:17.400 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Schwarzenegger
responded on the president's
favorite forum with a Twitter

03:20.533 --> 03:22.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, Former
California Governor: Hey,
Donald, I have a great idea.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why don't we switch jobs?

03:26.067 --> 03:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You take over TV, because you're
such an expert in ratings,
and I take over your job.

03:30.167 --> 03:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then people can finally
sleep comfortably again.

03:33.367 --> 03:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, Mr. Trump
met at the White House with the
leaders of the Senate Finance

03:38.100 --> 03:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and House Ways and
Means Committees.

03:40.133 --> 03:41.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The topic?

03:41.133 --> 03:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trade.

03:42.633 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA has been
a catastrophe for our country.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's been a catastrophe
for our workers and our
jobs and our companies.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're leaving our country.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to change it.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And maybe we do it.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Maybe we do a new NAFTA,
and we put an extra
F in the term NAFTA.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know what the
F is for, right?

04:00.733 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Free and fair trade.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not just free trade.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Free and fair trade.

04:05.767 --> 04:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president also
responded to violent protests
last night at the University

04:10.000 --> 04:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of California, Berkeley, that
led the cancellation of an
appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos.

04:14.533 --> 04:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the highly contentious
senior editor for Breitbart
News, formerly run by top Trump

04:20.300 --> 04:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
adviser Stephen Bannon.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump tweeted: "If U.C.

04:24.667 --> 04:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Berkeley doesn't allow free
speech and practices violence on
innocent people with a different

04:30.833 --> 04:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
point of view, no
federal funds?"

04:33.200 --> 04:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president may face protests
in person at his Mar-a-Lago
resort in Florida, where

04:37.733 --> 04:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he plans to spend the weekend.

04:40.067 --> 04:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, there are growing
indications that the White House
intends to put new sanctions

04:46.267 --> 04:48.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on Iran perhaps as
soon as tomorrow.

04:48.267 --> 04:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just yesterday, Lieutenant
General Michael Flynn, the
national security adviser, put

04:52.633 --> 04:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran on notice over a nuclear
-- over a missile test that he
said violated a United Nations

04:59.600 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Security Council resolution.

05:01.700 --> 05:06.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that violation has nothing
to do with the Iran nuclear
agreement, and administration

05:08.200 --> 05:11.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
officials say that
whatever sanctions there
may be will conform with
that agreement -- Judy.

05:13.967 --> 05:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, back
to something else you were
just talking about, and that's

05:16.667 --> 05:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's tweet where
he essentially sounded like he
was threatening the University

05:21.667 --> 05:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of California at Berkeley
over a loss of federal funds
because of those protests.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you hearing about
that at the White House?

05:30.133 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Berkeley
tells us they get about $600
million in federal funds, $200

05:36.433 --> 05:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million for financial aid for
students, another $400 million
for research, research grants.

05:41.567 --> 05:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The people who know about
federal funding for schools tell
us it's virtually impossible

05:48.333 --> 05:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a president or even a
Congress by themselves to
single out a university
or even a university

05:53.500 --> 05:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system to cut off their funds
unless they violate the law.

05:57.633 --> 06:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, separately,
John, there had been some
reporting that the president

06:04.667 --> 06:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might sign an executive order
that would allow businesses,
in effect, to not do business

06:09.567 --> 06:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with, not serve gays and
lesbians on religious grounds.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does that stand?

06:15.567 --> 06:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Sean Spicer
says that's not something
that they're ready to roll out

06:20.800 --> 06:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or to say that the
president is going to sign.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are indications
-- no indications
that it's coming soon.

06:25.867 --> 06:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To put this into a little
perspective, I talked
to people who worked
in the transition, and

06:30.100 --> 06:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said that they have been
encouraged to volunteer, to
write proposed executive orders,

06:38.333 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there was actually
a book of executive - -
proposed executive orders.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there are a lot of draft
executive orders on a lot of
topics, but, as Sean Spicer said

06:48.967 --> 06:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, the key is whether
or not President Trump says
that's the one I want to sign.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so far, on this
topic, Spicer said,
he hasn't said that.

06:57.300 --> 07:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John,
a lot for our White House
reporters to keep track of.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, John.

07:06.367 --> 07:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the day's other news:
Two more Cabinet nominees
advanced to the full
Senate for confirmation

07:11.567 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
votes.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two Senate committees endorsed
South Carolina Congressman
Mick Mulvaney to run the White

07:16.833 --> 07:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House Office of
Management and Budget.

07:19.433 --> 07:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the nomination of Scott
Pruitt to head the Environmental
Protection Agency got through

07:23.667 --> 07:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Senate
Environment Committee.

07:25.833 --> 07:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats boycotted that
meeting, so Republicans
suspended the rules, and
took the vote without

07:31.700 --> 07:33.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

07:33.733 --> 07:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The newly sworn-in secretary
of state, Rex Tillerson, urged
his employees today to put

07:39.000 --> 07:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aside any political differences
with President Trump.

07:41.367 --> 07:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds in the State Department
have signed what is called a
note of dissent against the

07:46.100 --> 07:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
executive order on
immigration and refugees.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tillerson addressed his work
force for the first time.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He praised them, and said he
understands their frustrations.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: I know this was a
hotly contested election and

07:58.100 --> 08:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we do not all feel the
same way about the outcome.

08:00.367 --> 08:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Each of us is entitled
to the expression of
our political beliefs.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we cannot let our personal
convictions overwhelm our
ability to work as one team.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
has warned the dissenting
State Department diplomats

08:14.800 --> 08:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to -- quote -- "get with
the program or get out."

08:18.133 --> 08:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary of homeland
security says he hopes to
complete a wall along the Mexico

08:23.867 --> 08:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
border within two years.

08:25.933 --> 08:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kelly told FOX News today
that he expects that Congress
will find the funding relatively

08:31.500 --> 08:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quickly, in his words.

08:33.533 --> 08:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has
insisted that Mexico will
ultimately cover the cost.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the department's
inspector general says that he
will review how the president's

08:41.933 --> 08:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immigration order
was implemented.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A snowpack survey in California
has found the most snow since
1995, enough that it could

08:51.300 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put an end to a
five-year drought.

08:53.733 --> 08:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today's check in the Sierra
Nevada follows major January
storms that brought more than

08:59.600 --> 09:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a year's worth of rain and snow.

09:01.700 --> 09:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The surge in precipitation
already lifted the northern half
of the state out of drought.

09:06.700 --> 09:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The storms also caused
heavy flooding and
damage in some places.

09:13.667 --> 09:17.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in Congress today
ramped up their efforts to roll
back Obama-era regulations.

09:17.467 --> 09:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate gave final approval
to rescinding a regulation
against dumping coal mine waste

09:23.100 --> 09:25.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into streams.

09:25.633 --> 09:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the House voted to
kill background checks
for mentally disabled
people on Social Security

09:30.700 --> 09:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who try to buy guns.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That measure now
goes to the Senate.

09:35.167 --> 09:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
six points to close below 19885.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell six, but
the S&amp;P 500 added a point.

09:46.967 --> 09:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
unraveling what went wrong
in a deadly military raid

09:50.733 --> 09:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Yemen; is President Trump's
aggressive approach putting
world leaders on edge?; the

09:57.833 --> 10:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic hurdles to replacing
Obamacare; and much more.

10:12.700 --> 10:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has made clear
that he will aggressively
target terror groups like ISIS

10:16.933 --> 10:18.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and al-Qaida.

10:18.633 --> 10:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On Sunday in Yemen, U.S.
special forces assaulted
an al-Qaida compound.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the first such raid
authorized by the new president.

10:26.833 --> 10:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But details of the planning
and the execution of the raid
have come under scrutiny this

10:31.733 --> 10:32.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the
early morning hours on Sunday,
members of the elite SEAL Team

10:38.633 --> 10:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six approached a village in the
Yakla region of Yemen's Bayda
province, their target, an

10:43.600 --> 10:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-Qaida stronghold known
to U.S. intelligence since
the Obama administration.

10:47.867 --> 10:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A firefight ensued, and the
commandos had to call in air
support from fighter aircraft

10:52.833 --> 10:54.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and helicopter gunships.

10:54.967 --> 10:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer
Ryan Owens, was killed in the
battle and a transport aircraft

11:00.400 --> 11:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suffered a hard landing
and had to be destroyed.

11:02.833 --> 11:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military
acknowledged last night that
it had also likely killed
civilian noncombatants

11:08.833 --> 11:10.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the fight.

11:10.467 --> 11:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
White House spokesman
Sean Spicer spoke of
the mission today:

11:13.200 --> 11:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: It's hard to ever
call something a complete

11:16.267 --> 11:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
success when you have a loss
of life or people injured.

11:20.233 --> 11:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think when you look at
the totality of what was gained
to prevent the future loss

11:25.067 --> 11:30.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of life here in America
and against our people
and our institutions
and probably throughout

11:32.133 --> 11:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world in terms of what some
of these individuals could have
done, I think it is a successful

11:37.033 --> 11:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operation by all standards.

11:39.133 --> 11:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more
on the raid and the strength
of the al-Qaida branch there,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined by David Sanger of
The New York Times and Richard
Atwood of the International

11:46.700 --> 11:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crisis Group, which released
a report today on the strength
and capabilities of al-Qaida

11:51.533 --> 11:53.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Yemen.

11:53.633 --> 11:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, I want to ask you first,
most presidents say this is
the toughest decision that they

11:56.533 --> 12:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have, to send a member of the
armed forces into harm's way.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was that decision-making
process like this time?

12:05.533 --> 12:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SANGER, The New York
Times: Well, the process
was somewhat unusual, Hari.

12:10.200 --> 12:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, a president goes
down in the Situation
Room, is presented with
what they call a full

12:14.967 --> 12:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
package for the attack.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a legal assessment of
the legal authorities under
which they're doing these.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a risk assessment to the
commandos who would be doing it.

12:25.167 --> 12:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a risk assessment
of what could happen to
civilians who are in the area.

12:33.100 --> 12:37.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This particular attack
had been set up by the
Obama administration.

12:37.367 --> 12:42.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They had debated it, and
President Obama decided
about 10 days before
the end of his term that

12:44.333 --> 12:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he couldn't approve it because
the Pentagon really wanted
to go in under the complete

12:46.833 --> 12:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cover of darkness,
a moonless night.

12:49.500 --> 12:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the next moonless night
wasn't going to be until after
he was no longer in office.

12:55.933 --> 12:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they kicked this one over
to the new administration.

12:59.133 --> 13:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it looks like President
Trump got briefed on it, by and
large, at a dinner, not in the

13:05.300 --> 13:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Situation Room, not with
legal advisers around.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His secretary of defense,
Jim Mattis, was there.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Vice President Pence was there.

13:12.867 --> 13:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stephen Bannon, who has emerged
as the newest member of the
National Security Council, known

13:17.367 --> 13:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really more for his political
advice than military, was there.

13:24.233 --> 13:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So was his new national
security adviser, Michael Flynn,
who is a veteran of many of

13:28.333 --> 13:29.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
these.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the discussion took
place in a dinner situation.

13:33.267 --> 13:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he approved the
raid at that dinner.

13:37.100 --> 13:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think one of the
questions, given how
many things have gone
wrong, is, would it

13:41.233 --> 13:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been different if he had
been in the Situation Room
and perhaps had a different

13:48.633 --> 13:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
set of briefings?

13:49.900 --> 13:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The White House insists not.

13:52.100 --> 13:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to call this much
of a success yet, because we
don't know what the value was of

13:59.133 --> 14:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the information they were
trying to exploit, which came
mostly from computers and cell

14:01.833 --> 14:03.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phones.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from everything we have
heard, they haven't had a
chance to assess that yet.

14:05.867 --> 14:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Richard
Atwood, put this in
perspective for us.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How strong is al-Qaida in Yemen?

14:11.233 --> 14:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD ATWOOD, International
Crisis Group: We -- as you said,
we published a report today

14:14.533 --> 14:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that looks at the evolution
of al-Qaida in Yemen.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, obviously, there's a lot
of talk about the Islamic State,
but, in Yemen, it's really

14:21.000 --> 14:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
al-Qaida that's done well
over the last few years.

14:24.967 --> 14:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Really, the civil war
-- it's been the main
beneficiary of the civil war.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as fighting has escalated
between the two sides, between
President Hadi's government

14:32.967 --> 14:37.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and its Saudi-backed
international coalition
on the one hand against
the Houthis and former

14:39.900 --> 14:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Saleh, as fighting
has escalated, al-Qaida has
really been able to exploit the

14:43.100 --> 14:45.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chaos.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been able to control
territory and control
the town of Mukalla on
the Gulf of Aden for

14:48.333 --> 14:49.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some time.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's strengthened its
ties to some communities.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has very ties, close ties
with some of the other armed
groups that are fighting in

14:55.167 --> 14:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the anti-Houthi Saleh alliance.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It's undoubtedly
got much richer.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been able to
raid banks in Mukalla.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was embedded in the economy
in Mukalla for a long time.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's much better armed.

15:06.900 --> 15:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been able to gain guns and
weapons that have been passed
into other armed groups in

15:12.033 --> 15:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which it's in an alliance.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I think it's
stronger than ever.

15:16.533 --> 15:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, the longer the
war continues in Yemen, the
stronger al-Qaida is likely

15:22.000 --> 15:23.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to get.

15:23.933 --> 15:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just -- on the operation
yesterday, you know, I think
I agree with David that

15:27.833 --> 15:31.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's very difficult to know
whether it's a success until
we know what information was

15:31.567 --> 15:33.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retrieved.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, I think
there's aspects of it that
are clearly not a success.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of tribesmen
at the moment in Yemen.

15:39.400 --> 15:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an operation like this
is more likely to radicalize
them, more likely to push them

15:46.233 --> 15:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the arms of al-Qaida,
particularly then if it has a
high civilian cost, if it kills

15:51.267 --> 15:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women, if it kills
children, particularly if
U.S. forces are involved.

15:53.467 --> 15:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It tends to feed
anti-Americanism and strengthen
those alliances between
the tribes in al-Qaida,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is what
al-Qaida profits from.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, did
any of thing from officials
or anybody else that you spoke

16:03.767 --> 16:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say that that factored
into the Trump administration
or President Trump's
decision to do this?

16:10.733 --> 16:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: We don't have a
lot of view into the decision
-- discussion that they

16:16.200 --> 16:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had at the dinner table.

16:19.100 --> 16:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Richard raises one
of the most important points.

16:22.400 --> 16:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over time, presidents learn
that the biggest risk out here
is not only the civilian risk

16:29.333 --> 16:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the risk to American forces,
but whether - - as Donald
Rumsfeld used to say, whether

16:35.267 --> 16:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're creating terrorists
faster than you're killing them.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And certainly, if you have
a case like this where there
appear to have been considerable

16:46.767 --> 16:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civilian casualties, that may
well be the case, especially
because, even if some of

16:52.267 --> 16:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those civilians may have taken
up arms and fired against
the SEALs, in the mythology

16:57.733 --> 17:00.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of what went on, you're
going to hear a story
of SEALs who dropped out
of the sky and suddenly

17:02.233 --> 17:05.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacked a remote
village in Yemen.

17:05.267 --> 17:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can imagine the
recruiting capability of that.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, part of what's
going on here, Hari, is that you
have in the Trump administration

17:16.867 --> 17:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group that believes that the
decision-making in these kind
of cases has to be shortened,

17:22.167 --> 17:26.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that more of the power has
to be devolved down to the
Pentagon, the commanders.

17:28.133 --> 17:31.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, in the first case
that the president approved,
things went very badly wrong.

17:33.467 --> 17:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to wonder whether
or not that is going to have
the effect of making them

17:37.933 --> 17:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that they need to slow
down and think more about the
effects of these and get fuller

17:44.833 --> 17:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
briefings, or whether they're
simply going to say, look,
this happens sometimes.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, David Sanger, Richard
Atwood, thank you both.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD ATWOOD: Thank you.

17:52.367 --> 17:57.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SANGER: Thank you.

17:59.367 --> 18:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, barely two
weeks into his term, President
Trump has shaken up global

18:06.500 --> 18:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affairs through a series of
unilateral legal and diplomatic
moves and some blunt talk and

18:12.633 --> 18:14.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

18:14.700 --> 18:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Longstanding American allies
and adversaries are asking
what the new administration has

18:20.867 --> 18:23.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in mind for its
relations abroad.

18:23.167 --> 18:28.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of several clues,
Iran's test-launch of a
medium-range ballistic
missile, which triggered

18:30.867 --> 18:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a direct White House response
from Mr. Trump's national
security team yesterday.

18:37.867 --> 18:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in a tweet this morning,
the president wrote: "Iran has
been formally put on notice

18:42.567 --> 18:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for firing a ballistic missile."

18:45.067 --> 18:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear just what "on
notice" means, but Mr. Trump
was asked today whether military

18:50.867 --> 18:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
action is off the table.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
Nothing is off the table.

18:54.933 --> 18:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A top adviser to
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Khamenei, dismissed it all

19:01.733 --> 19:05.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, saying: "The American
government will understand that
threatening Iran is useless."

19:07.533 --> 19:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By contrast, the administration
has been relatively quiet about
new fighting in Eastern Ukraine

19:13.233 --> 19:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between government forces and
Russian-backed rebels, though,
late today, the U.S. ambassador

19:20.267 --> 19:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said
the situation requires clear
and wrong strong condemnation

19:25.333 --> 19:27.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Russian actions.

19:27.467 --> 19:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's conciliatory talk
about Russia and his critiques
of the European Union have

19:33.567 --> 19:36.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders on the
continent concerned.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Tusk is president
of the European Council.

19:38.733 --> 19:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: We should today
remind our American friends of

19:45.200 --> 19:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
their own motto:
United we stand.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Divided, we fall.

19:51.433 --> 19:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
a phone call Saturday
with Australia's Prime
Minister Malcolm Turnbull

19:56.367 --> 19:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is raising eyebrows.

19:58.500 --> 20:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post reports
the president told Turnbull,
"This was the worst call by

20:04.233 --> 20:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
far" that he's had
with a foreign leader.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At issue, the Obama
administration's agreement
to resettle refugees not
allowed into Australia.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I love
Australia as a country.

20:15.067 --> 20:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we had a problem where,
for whatever reason, President
Obama said that they were going

20:21.933 --> 20:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take probably well over
1,000 illegal immigrants
who were in prisons.

20:28.767 --> 20:29.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I said, why?

20:29.767 --> 20:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why are we doing this?

20:31.333 --> 20:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prime
Minister Turnbull played
down the incident.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM TURNBULL, Australian
Prime Minister: The fact that
we received the assurance that

20:37.767 --> 20:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we did, the fact that it was
confirmed, the very extensive
engagement we have with the

20:44.267 --> 20:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new administration underlines
the closeness of the alliance.

20:48.033 --> 20:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately, the
Associated Press reports Mr.
Trump told Mexico's president

20:55.133 --> 20:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he might send U.S. troops
to deal with -- quote - -
"bad hombres down there."

20:59.667 --> 21:02.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House says the
remark was lighthearted.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mexico denies it happened.

21:04.533 --> 21:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The president's take?

21:05.533 --> 21:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I fix things.

21:06.867 --> 21:09.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to
straighten it out.

21:09.267 --> 21:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Believe me, when you hear
about tough phone calls I'm
having, don't worry about it.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All this as the
newly minted secretary of state
tried to rally a work force,

21:21.533 --> 21:25.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many of whom are already
unhappy, following last
weekend's unveiling of
extensive restrictions

21:27.100 --> 21:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for travelers from seven
majority-Muslim nations.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: We're on the same team.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We share the same mission.

21:34.933 --> 21:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Rex Tillerson began
today by discussing that
policy with Germany's

21:39.967 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreign minister.

21:42.067 --> 21:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a deeper look now at
the president's actions on the
world stage with James Jeffrey.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served in several senior
positions during his 35-year
career as a diplomat, including

21:54.333 --> 21:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. ambassador to Turkey
and to Iraq, and as President
George W. Bush's deputy national

21:59.233 --> 22:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser.

22:00.733 --> 22:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wendy Sherman, she was
undersecretary of state for
political affairs during the

22:08.833 --> 22:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama administration.

22:10.933 --> 22:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She also held senior State
Department jobs during the
Clinton administration.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you back to the program.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Iraq: Thank you.

22:18.667 --> 22:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs: Great to be

22:19.200 --> 22:21.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just ask
you first, Ambassador Jeffrey,
what do you make overall

22:23.167 --> 22:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the approach we're
seeing from this president
to foreign policy?

22:25.200 --> 22:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Well, you
have to separate the drama
from some of the decisions.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a longtime career guy,
I like quiet diplomacy
behind closed doors.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not what we're getting.

22:37.667 --> 22:41.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the end of the day,
it's what America does,
how people perceive us,
in the long run, our

22:44.033 --> 22:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reliability and such,
and, thirdly, the personal
relationships presidents
have with their counterparts.

22:49.633 --> 22:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tweeting and some of the
explosive conversations can hurt
the third and can have an impact

22:56.933 --> 23:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the second, but, in the
end, what we really should
focus on is the policies.

23:01.467 --> 23:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of them have been bad, the
rollout of the immigration ban.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Others, we have to wait and see.

23:08.033 --> 23:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reaction to the
Iranians, that was basically
within normal boundaries.

23:11.567 --> 23:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, and
I want to ask you both
about the specifics.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, overall, Wendy Sherman, how
do you read what's happening?

23:15.767 --> 23:19.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: You know, I think
that Republican analyst Steve
Schmidt had a great line, which

23:19.567 --> 23:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, Americans clearly
voted for change, but they
didn't vote for chaos.

23:26.567 --> 23:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think people are feeling
unnerved all around the world,
because they see a chaotic

23:31.567 --> 23:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
set of directions coming out
of the White House, and they're
not sure what it all means.

23:33.900 --> 23:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Although I understand
what Ambassador Jeffrey
is saying about Michael
Flynn saying, Iran,

23:40.933 --> 23:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are on notice, might have
been a response to the missile
launch, indeed, nobody knew

23:45.167 --> 23:46.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what that meant.

23:46.833 --> 23:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it really roiled
people to try to figure
out what was happening.

23:50.100 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the president has leaked
out what happens in his phone
calls, and he's really taking

23:57.133 --> 24:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on some of our dearest allies
and partners around the world,
people don't know what to

24:02.500 --> 24:05.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expect and whether they can rely
on the United States anymore.

24:05.367 --> 24:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they need to be able to
rely on us, just as we need
to be able to rely on them.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Jim
Jeffrey, what about this
comment the president
made, reportedly,

24:13.333 --> 24:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the phone conversation with
the prime minister of Australia,
when he said, "This is the worst

24:18.033 --> 24:20.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
phone call I have had
with any world leader"?

24:20.967 --> 24:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of
back-and-forth that lends
itself, I guess, to, you
know, good work happening

24:30.733 --> 24:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between these two countries?

24:32.700 --> 24:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Secretary Sherman
and I know that presidents
often have really bad phone

24:37.600 --> 24:39.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversations.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they usually don't do
is go out and talk about it.

24:41.033 --> 24:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That gets to my point about
doing some damage on the
periphery of our core policies.

24:48.267 --> 24:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying what he said is
really no different from
what other presidents

24:50.700 --> 24:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - the kind of thing other
presidents would have said?

24:52.733 --> 24:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: No, presidents
always -- not always, but often
have bad conversations with

24:58.300 --> 25:00.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counterparts.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just don't go out and
embarrass their counterpart
by talking about it.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They find other ways to work
it out, which is what we're
trying to do right now.

25:05.867 --> 25:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's this public airing of the
dirty laundry that is a problem.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's not
only that, Wendy Sherman.

25:14.400 --> 25:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the phone conversation,
the hour-long phone conversation
with the president of Mexico.

25:19.267 --> 25:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We later learned the president
said something to the effect
of sending U.S. troops down

25:23.300 --> 25:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there if you don't take care of
-- quote -- "the bad hombres."

25:25.467 --> 25:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: If you read
Donald Trump's book "The Art
of the Deal," you know that

25:30.233 --> 25:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he likes to create leverage,
he likes to have psychological
advantage, he likes to be on

25:34.667 --> 25:36.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the offense.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He believes in what he
calls truthful hyperbole.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He thinks all press
is good press.

25:40.567 --> 25:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he believes that
he's putting everybody on a
psychological disadvantage,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that he can have some
advantage in negotiations.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAFTA is high on his agenda.

25:50.033 --> 25:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if he goes too far, I think
the president of Mexico and
the Mexicans will decide they

25:56.300 --> 25:58.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would just as soon get
out of NAFTA, and we
don't want that either.

25:58.667 --> 26:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There may need to be some
changes, but to re-imagine the
entire world, as Ambassador

26:05.500 --> 26:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey said, we have had
an international order.

26:09.333 --> 26:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not perfect, but for
70 years, it has kept Europe
whole and free and safe, and we

26:16.733 --> 26:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need to keep it in place.

26:19.133 --> 26:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ambassador
Jeffrey, what's the
difference between having
a vigorous conversation

26:23.467 --> 26:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and doing real damage?

26:25.433 --> 26:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just looking again at
what the president said this
morning at the Prayer Breakfast.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said, don't worry
about the reports of
the tough phone calls.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said, we have to be tough.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's time that we're going
to be a little tough.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Well,
again, it does some damage.

26:36.033 --> 26:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as Wendy Sherman
said, behind the fireworks,
there are real issues
that the president and

26:42.200 --> 26:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particularly Steve Bannon, his
political adviser, are pushing.

26:45.200 --> 26:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a vision, a rather
dark vision, of a 19th
century world where great
powers do transactional

26:51.200 --> 26:53.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

26:53.167 --> 26:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very different
than what we have been
doing for the last 75 years.

26:54.967 --> 26:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what are
you referring to specifically?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What concerns you?

26:59.467 --> 27:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: I'm concerned
about a relationship
with Russia that ignores
Russia's aggressiveness

27:03.733 --> 27:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in its near abroad.

27:05.900 --> 27:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm concerned about the
willingness to question
alliances and the value
of allies, or require

27:12.833 --> 27:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them to pay more, or
they don't get to play.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Reference to NATO?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES JEFFREY: Exactly.

27:19.333 --> 27:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we just
-- we were just looking at a
newswire report a moment ago,

27:25.467 --> 27:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wendy Sherman, where we are
told that the vice president,
Mike Pence, had a meeting

27:30.800 --> 27:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the German foreign
minister today in which
he -- they discussed NATO.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This just happened
within the hour.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And among other things, they
talked about the importance
of NATO members paying up.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is something Donald
Trump talked about
during the campaign.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Absolutely.

27:42.300 --> 27:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so did President Obama talk
about it and push countries
to pay what they should as

27:47.200 --> 27:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their fair share in NATO.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we should all push
every member to do that.

27:50.867 --> 27:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the NATO alliance is
not just a transactional
relationship, once again.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That alliance serves
our interests.

27:57.733 --> 28:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That alliance has been critical
to keeping security in Europe,
so that we do not face

28:02.433 --> 28:03.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
another world war.

28:03.867 --> 28:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it is in our national
security interests.

28:06.533 --> 28:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, we pay a lot for it,
but, when we had Afghanistan,
NATO troops were by our side

28:13.700 --> 28:16.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from almost all of
the NATO members.

28:16.467 --> 28:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they put their life and
treasure on the line for us.

28:20.733 --> 28:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I come
back to the question,
Ambassador Jeffrey, at
what point -- how far

28:27.700 --> 28:32.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can a president go with tough
talk that's helpful for the
United States, that builds

28:34.367 --> 28:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reputation and stands the
United States in good stead,
and when does it go too far?

28:40.533 --> 28:42.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where to draw the line?

28:42.367 --> 28:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Again, it's
a judgmental question.

28:44.633 --> 28:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each of us have a different
reaction to tough talk, and our
friends abroad have a different

28:49.600 --> 28:51.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reaction, too.

28:51.700 --> 28:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, it is
what he does or doesn't do
as crises come up and as he

28:57.200 --> 28:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tries to advance his agenda.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can hurt it on the
margins by this kind of talk.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my view.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He could help it with a
different approach to our allies
and friends and our foes.

29:07.533 --> 29:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the end of the day,
it's going to be, what sort
of decisions does he take in

29:12.100 --> 29:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
response to the really
great threats we have
in the world today?

29:14.900 --> 29:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there a
risk -- or how much of a risk,
I should say, Wendy Sherman,

29:18.633 --> 29:20.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is there to damaging
personal relationships?

29:20.767 --> 29:22.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Or is that not
really an issue here?

29:22.667 --> 29:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WENDY SHERMAN: No, I
think that is an issue.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's already happened.

29:26.067 --> 29:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One should talk tough to friends
in private, but, as the first
phone call with the president

29:32.100 --> 29:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States,
you're trying to build
your personal relationship.

29:34.133 --> 29:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're trying to build
on the alliance and the
partnerships that we have.

29:39.767 --> 29:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Usually, that tough talk
doesn't happen with your
friends and partners.

29:41.900 --> 29:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people wonder why the tough
talk is happening with Mexico
and happening with Germany and

29:46.700 --> 29:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening with our pals, but
it's not happening with Russia.

29:50.633 --> 29:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that
a concern for you?

29:52.800 --> 29:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Absolutely.

29:54.900 --> 29:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia is the biggest threat
right now to the international
order, not the Islamic State,

30:01.067 --> 30:03.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not Iran, although
I have problems with
Iran, and not China.

30:03.567 --> 30:05.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's Russia.

30:05.567 --> 30:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're hearing
a lot more about the Islamic
State and al-Qaida, in fact,

30:09.400 --> 30:10.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

30:10.933 --> 30:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, well, a subject
very much to be continued.

30:13.367 --> 30:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador Jim Jeffrey,
Wendy Sherman, we thank you.

30:17.033 --> 30:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you.

30:21.867 --> 30:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Thank you.

30:26.700 --> 30:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:33.733 --> 30:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
woman's mission to help girls
in Liberia; and a letter to

30:38.933 --> 30:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
five presidents
who owned slaves.

30:42.933 --> 30:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: Can Obamacare
be repealed and replaced
with a law without a
mandate requiring health

30:49.400 --> 30:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance coverage?

30:51.833 --> 30:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something the
president and congressional
Republicans seem to be
trying to do, although

30:55.633 --> 30:57.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just how is not
at all clear yet.

30:57.967 --> 31:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the annual enrollment season
for buying insurance has come
to a close, there are very

31:02.733 --> 31:07.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
real questions about how
this all would play out
once the law is changed.

31:07.567 --> 31:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, went to Kentucky
to explore that further.

31:12.133 --> 31:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
series, Making Sense.

31:14.833 --> 31:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Folks, folks,
we want to end Obamacare.

31:21.833 --> 31:26.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to go to a plan that
is so much better and so
much less expensive, right?

31:26.467 --> 31:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:29.033 --> 31:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Throughout
the campaign, Donald Trump
promised to repeal and
replace the Affordable

31:33.067 --> 31:34.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: So help me God.

31:36.067 --> 31:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, sure enough,
on Inauguration Day, he signed
his first executive order,

31:41.133 --> 31:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directing government agencies
to begin scaling back the law.

31:44.700 --> 31:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was good news for Trump
voter Perry Partin, a security
guard from Corbin, Kentucky.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PERRY PARTIN, Kentucky: It was
forced on me, shoved down your
throat, whether you wanted

31:54.300 --> 31:55.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it or not.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOBBI SMITH, Kentucky:
I'm with Perry.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bobbi (ph) Smith,
who owns an antiques store,
was diagnosed with breast

31:59.700 --> 32:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cancer in the fall of 2015, a
year in which, having missed
the open enrollment deadline,

32:06.133 --> 32:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she'd accidentally gone
without health insurance.

32:09.233 --> 32:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She waited until January
to buy coverage on
healthcare.gov and get treated.

32:13.767 --> 32:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, says this Trump voter:

32:15.833 --> 32:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOBBI SMITH: I think if I were
to walk around here with no
health insurance, and that's

32:19.133 --> 32:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what I choose to do,
then that's my right.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you're thankful
you have that insurance?

32:22.967 --> 32:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOBBI SMITH: Oh, yes, I am, yes.

32:24.733 --> 32:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you're
kind of torn here?

32:26.800 --> 32:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOBBI SMITH: That's right.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Elizabeth
Easton has no such conflicts.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH EASTON,
Kentucky: I love it.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing that Trump
would be able to do for me
would be universal health care.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Easton
didn't vote for Trump.

32:38.200 --> 32:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She didn't vote at all, she
says, because she was high
and suicidal, having relapsed

32:44.633 --> 32:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into drug abuse following
a painful spinal infection.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's now in recovery,
her addiction treatment
covered by Medicaid,
which was expanded under

32:53.333 --> 32:54.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: I have been a
user since I was in high school.

32:56.967 --> 32:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was able to check into
treatment because of it.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you
wouldn't have been without
the Affordable Care Act?

33:02.200 --> 33:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH EASTON:
It saved my life.

33:04.033 --> 33:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's -- yes, it's great.

33:06.200 --> 33:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: We came to
this corner of Kentucky
last week, famous as the
birthplace of Colonel

33:10.233 --> 33:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken,
because it's seen one of the
biggest drops in the uninsured

33:16.367 --> 33:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rate due to the
Affordable Care Act.

33:18.400 --> 33:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kathy Oller says she herself has
signed up thousands, including,
on this day, mall jewelry

33:24.133 --> 33:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
store worker Aaron Lewis.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AARON LEWIS, Kentucky: To me
personally, it was worth the
peace of mind to have some sort

33:28.200 --> 33:30.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of safety net.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In case something did happen
to me or in case some illness
or accident happened, I would

33:32.733 --> 33:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a little bit more
covered, rather than
susceptible to bankruptcy.

33:35.433 --> 33:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when we
visited, with just over a week
to go before the deadline for

33:39.900 --> 33:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2017 coverage, the enrollment
rush had stalled, in part due
to the Trump administration's

33:46.267 --> 33:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cancellation of ads
urging people to sign up.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there's another
reason, says Oller.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY OLLER, Obamacare
Enrollment Official:
Some people feel that
because Trump's in office,

33:53.800 --> 33:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why do we have to have
it, because they're hoping
they don't get fined.

33:57.633 --> 34:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In other
words, they're counting
on repeal to kill the
mandate, the requirement

34:04.100 --> 34:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to buy health insurance, or else
pay a penalty to the government.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY FLANNERY, Kentucky:
We get this letter, you got to
get insurance, which instantly

34:10.533 --> 34:11.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infuriated me.

34:11.533 --> 34:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Don't tread on me.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY FLANNERY: Yes.

34:14.567 --> 34:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Health care worker
Anthony Flannery refused to
buy insurance each of the last

34:17.067 --> 34:19.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years.

34:19.067 --> 34:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY FLANNERY: I was looking
at like $280 with a $6,000
deductible that would then pay

34:24.467 --> 34:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
60 percent of any medical
expenses I may incur.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was like, no,
I'm not doing it.

34:29.633 --> 34:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I will pay the penalty.

34:31.033 --> 34:34.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, last year come
tax time, I owed $652.

34:34.367 --> 34:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For tax year
2016, the fine will be higher.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But so what, says Perry Partin?

34:40.633 --> 34:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PERRY PARTIN: It's cheaper
to pay the fine than it is
to pay for the insurance.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So are you
going to pay the fine,
instead of the insurance?

34:45.600 --> 34:49.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PERRY PARTIN: I probably
will, you know, because,
I mean, my cup's about
run over with insurance.

34:49.967 --> 34:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But can whatever
replaces Obamacare accommodate
Perry Partin, while also caring

34:55.567 --> 34:57.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Beth Easton?

34:57.533 --> 35:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: This time last
year, I was in the hospital,
almost died several times.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: With her many
preexisting conditions?

35:02.833 --> 35:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK, Economist, Cornell
University: If you don't have
a mandate, you cannot have

35:06.267 --> 35:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an insurance system.

35:08.300 --> 35:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To an economist
like Bob Frank, cases like
Easton's make the logic behind

35:12.033 --> 35:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the mandate crystal clear.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: The only
way a system of insurance can
work is if everybody's in the

35:17.600 --> 35:21.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pool together, healthy
and sick people alike.

35:21.767 --> 35:26.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you want healthy
people in the pool, you
have essentially got
to mandate that they

35:27.500 --> 35:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a participant.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's simply how
insurance works, he says.

35:31.067 --> 35:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: The insurance
company needs a large number
of people, only a few of whom

35:36.600 --> 35:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are going to make
claims against it.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But if it
were mainly sick people
in the pool, the costs per
person would skyrocket.

35:43.300 --> 35:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, poorer people,
who also tend to have poorer
health, need financial help to

35:49.567 --> 35:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pay their premiums.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AARON LEWIS: There's no
way to insure people who
have lower income are
able to get it without

35:54.900 --> 35:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increasing taxes on somebody.

35:57.067 --> 36:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the case
of Obamacare, increasing
taxes on top earners,
who help subsidize most

36:03.300 --> 36:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the 20-plus million people
who gained coverage under
the Affordable Care Act.

36:07.567 --> 36:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: And so there you
have the three basic components
of the Affordable Care Act,

36:15.067 --> 36:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mandates -- you have
to buy insurance -- the
guarantee that if you have
preexisting conditions,

36:20.533 --> 36:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't be denied coverage,
and then subsidies if you
can't afford to buy insurance.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you take any one
of those away, the
whole system collapses.

36:27.300 --> 36:31.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And if the current
system is repealed, but not
replaced, at least 18 million

36:33.433 --> 36:36.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people stand to lose
their insurance within
a year, according to
the Congressional Budget

36:36.267 --> 36:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Office, which might feel
worse than never having
had insurance at all.

36:39.733 --> 36:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHY OLLER: I think it's
such a backwards step, because
they are now excited because

36:44.333 --> 36:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have the opportunity
to sign up for health care.

36:47.067 --> 36:51.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they take it away,
it's just going backwards,
instead of forward.

36:51.367 --> 36:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Behavioral
economists call this loss
aversion, illustrated
in this YouTube

36:57.033 --> 36:59.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cartoon.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's more painful to
lose something than it's
joyful to gain something.

37:01.567 --> 37:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To most people,
it turns out, losing $1,000,
say, hurts far more than the

37:07.433 --> 37:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pleasure of $1,000 windfall.

37:09.533 --> 37:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bob Frank applies this
attachment to what we have
to threats to Obamacare.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: Millions have
coverage now for the first time.

37:18.333 --> 37:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they take people's
coverage away from them with
this new repeal measure, you're

37:25.333 --> 37:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to see a political
firestorm unlike anything we
have seen in recent history.

37:31.067 --> 37:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It was enough to
scare Elizabeth Easton straight.

37:33.033 --> 37:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH EASTON: I had an
epiphany, like, the world's
gone completely mad, and I have

37:36.833 --> 37:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got to get better.

37:37.900 --> 37:38.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seriously.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not joking.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, thank you, Mr. Trump.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:43.767 --> 37:45.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH EASTON: You
got me sober, so I can
try to save health care.

37:45.867 --> 37:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: No wonder
Republicans are having
such a tough time coming
up with a replacement

37:52.667 --> 37:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, and how hard it is for
working folks like Anthony
Flannery, who finally joined

37:56.567 --> 37:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the insurance pool this year.

37:58.533 --> 38:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY FLANNERY: If we want to
look at this from a standpoint
of doing my part to fit

38:05.800 --> 38:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into this pool and this
social responsibility,
I can handle that.

38:09.600 --> 38:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But to Bobbi Smith
and Perry Partin, it's the
very principle of a mandate

38:14.533 --> 38:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that rankles, no
matter the economics.

38:17.233 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can there be health
insurance if the healthier
people don't participate?

38:24.200 --> 38:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because then it's just going
to be the sicker people who are
going to be insured, and then

38:30.167 --> 38:32.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the cost is going
to be too high, no?

38:32.167 --> 38:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOBBI SMITH: You made a point.

38:34.367 --> 38:35.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:35.833 --> 38:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOBBI SMITH: I didn't
say I necessarily agreed.

38:39.267 --> 38:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You made a point I
will think about.

38:41.533 --> 38:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PERRY PARTIN: I would
say you're right.

38:43.533 --> 38:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I'm just like her.

38:44.933 --> 38:47.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If you want insurance,
it would be your option.

38:47.367 --> 38:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," economics
correspondent Paul
Solman, reporting from

38:52.967 --> 38:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Corbin, Kentucky.

38:59.300 --> 39:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The West
African nation of Liberia has
had more than its fair shares

39:08.167 --> 39:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of challenges, a 14-year civil
war and an Ebola epidemic
that left nearly 5,000 people

39:15.200 --> 39:17.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on a recent trip, special
correspondent Fred de Sam
Lazaro found one American woman

39:22.633 --> 39:25.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trying to help the
country rebuild,
focusing on young girls.

39:25.767 --> 39:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of Fred's
series Agents for Change.

39:28.300 --> 39:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Thirty-four
year old Katie Meyler is a
well-known figure in West Point,

39:34.500 --> 39:36.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of the poorest
slums in Monrovia.

39:36.467 --> 39:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With a freckled face, strawberry
blonde hair, combat boots,
and a dress, she stands out.

39:43.300 --> 39:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Meyler feels right at home
here, and there's no greater
proof of that than her decision

39:50.267 --> 39:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to remain here during the
Ebola epidemic that ravaged
the city two years ago.

39:53.333 --> 39:56.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The virus took
thousands of lives.

39:56.267 --> 40:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most outsiders who
weren't medical
personnel were evacuated,
including journalists.

40:03.233 --> 40:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meyler filled that void
with regular social media
posts and interviews.

40:05.233 --> 40:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER, Founder, More
Than Me Academy: I'd rather die
at 30 years old, or 32 years

40:09.200 --> 40:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
old, living for what I really
believe from head to toe in
every single way possible than

40:16.133 --> 40:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to live to be 90 years
old and not really fulfill
what I was born to do.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Benu is actually number
1 in her classes.

40:22.367 --> 40:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For the
past 11 years, Meyler has
made young women like Benu her

40:26.700 --> 40:29.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cause.

40:29.267 --> 40:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is the founder of
the More Than Me Academy,
a private school which
provides free education

40:34.733 --> 40:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for kindergarten through
sixth-grade girls,
and then scholarships
for them to go on to

40:37.333 --> 40:39.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high school.

40:39.933 --> 40:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most of the girls come
from large families
and would normally be
selling food and water

40:44.200 --> 40:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the streets, or
something worse.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meyler says the extreme
poverty in Liberia
leads to particularly
insidious behaviors.

40:51.767 --> 40:56.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATIE MEYLER: How bad
when you're trying just
every single day to get
a cup of rice to stay

40:57.467 --> 40:59.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alive?

40:59.600 --> 41:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I've seen and heard
and know of mothers that have
ended up prostituting their

41:02.767 --> 41:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own children just to survive,
and it sounds horrific to
anybody on the outside.

41:08.833 --> 41:09.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Of course.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How can a mother do that?

41:11.333 --> 41:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But how could a mother
let her daughter die, too?

41:13.367 --> 41:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meyler's
passion for social justice began
more than 20 years ago as a

41:18.233 --> 41:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teenager in suburban New
Jersey, where she was
raised by a single mother.

41:22.667 --> 41:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Often, the family was
dysfunctional, she says.

41:25.133 --> 41:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Often, they had
to go on welfare.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Meyler says she found
solace at her church.

41:29.867 --> 41:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: It felt good
to help others, and it helped
me get out of my own things

41:34.467 --> 41:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that were going on in my life.

41:35.967 --> 41:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I got addicted to really
making other people happy.

41:39.133 --> 41:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She went
on to graduate from college,
the first in her family to do

41:43.033 --> 41:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, and took a paid
internship with the charity
Samaritan's Purse, which
assigned her to Liberia.

41:50.033 --> 41:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: I didn't
know where Liberia was on
a map, and I Googled it.

41:52.433 --> 41:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So it was
meant to be for six months?

41:54.167 --> 41:55.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATIE MEYLER: Yes.

41:55.467 --> 41:56.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
It's been 11 years.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:57.533 --> 41:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
What happened?

41:59.600 --> 42:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: There's a saying
that nobody chooses Liberia,
that Liberia chooses you.

42:02.433 --> 42:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think part of it is, you come
here and you see the amount
of need the place has, and

42:09.567 --> 42:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people are very warm
and open, and you can make
a big difference here.

42:13.900 --> 42:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She
saw a need for education.

42:16.400 --> 42:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten years ago, more
than half of all primary
school-aged children
didn't attend, collateral

42:22.700 --> 42:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
damage from this country's
14-year-long civil war.

42:25.500 --> 42:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Meyler began raising
money, at first mostly through
her church for scholarships.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But she quickly became
disenchanted with
the existing schools.

42:34.067 --> 42:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: They're not really
learning anything at school,
because the teachers don't

42:38.033 --> 42:40.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come on time.

42:40.033 --> 42:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even -- both in public and
private schools, it's very rare
that teachers show up and they

42:45.200 --> 42:47.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are accountable.

42:47.167 --> 42:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meyler
decided she had to start her
own school, so she raised money

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from both small and large donors
in the United States, purchased
a building, and hired teachers.

42:57.367 --> 43:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The school provides breakfast
and lunch, medical services,
and after-school programs.

43:01.767 --> 43:06.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a strong emphasis
on empowering girls to stand
up against sexual abuse.

43:08.033 --> 43:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The school can
accommodate 180 students.

43:09.300 --> 43:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hundreds more wish
they could attend.

43:15.267 --> 43:17.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We met one of them on
our trip to West Point.

43:17.767 --> 43:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: But she
stopped in third grade
from going to school
because her family doesn't

43:20.633 --> 43:22.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have any money.

43:22.133 --> 43:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: What can
you do for a child like this?

43:24.100 --> 43:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: So, unfortunately,
our school only has 180
spots, and so, at this point,

43:31.200 --> 43:32.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we don't have any space.

43:32.867 --> 43:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
And her students are
still playing catchup.

43:35.900 --> 43:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ebola shut down all schools
in Liberia for a full year,
a period when educating girls

43:42.900 --> 43:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
took a back seat to saving
their lives, she says, even
as she feared for her own.

43:46.100 --> 43:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: What defines
you the most is what you
do despite your fear.

43:50.367 --> 43:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I was extremely afraid.

43:52.433 --> 43:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had -- I signed my power of
attorney away before I left,
just in case something happened.

43:59.033 --> 44:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There was a real,
legitimate concern that
I might not return home.

44:03.333 --> 44:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She had
to bribe her way into the West
Point neighborhood where most

44:06.800 --> 44:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of her students live.

44:08.833 --> 44:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It had been quarantined and,
she discovered, had virtually
no health services or equipment.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She raised money to buy
ambulances and medical
supplies and turned her
school into a disaster

44:19.233 --> 44:21.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
response center.

44:21.267 --> 44:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: Our plan was,
do everything you can to keep
everybody alive, and then

44:23.300 --> 44:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you can't do anything else,
bring dignity in death, so we
did a lot of that, too, like

44:26.200 --> 44:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
singing to people, praying
with people while they died.

44:28.800 --> 44:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children that were dying
outside, some of them were just
laying outside of the overflow

44:34.267 --> 44:36.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
center.

44:36.333 --> 44:38.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ones inside were actually
worse off, because they were the
dead mixed with the living all

44:38.367 --> 44:39.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they could barely
move, barely could speak.

44:41.333 --> 44:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How
do you recover from that?

44:43.433 --> 44:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: I don't want to
get over this, because we have
to do something to make sure

44:45.300 --> 44:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it doesn't happen again.

44:47.333 --> 44:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that remembering and
feeling what it felt like and
to see that national emergency,

44:53.367 --> 44:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it motivates me and fuels
me to fight to ensure that
it doesn't happen again.

44:57.500 --> 45:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meyler
believes one of the main
contributors to the Ebola crisis

45:01.100 --> 45:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the lack of education,
so she went to the government
to propose that some private

45:05.500 --> 45:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
groups be brought into
overhaul the system.

45:08.433 --> 45:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A pilot project began this
past fall using seven different
organizations to revamp 94

45:16.000 --> 45:17.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

45:17.667 --> 45:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More Than Me was put in charge
of six of those schools.

45:20.500 --> 45:25.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met up with Meyler at a
back-to-school celebration in
the rural village of Bogbeh.

45:25.367 --> 45:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: Most of the
parents and the community
members here don't read or write

45:29.700 --> 45:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and didn't have basic education.

45:31.667 --> 45:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they're really excited that
out of 2,750 public schools
in the country that really

45:38.400 --> 45:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't functioning, barely
functioning, if functioning
at all, that their school was

45:41.600 --> 45:43.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
selected among a few.

45:43.667 --> 45:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meyler and
her staff have helped oversee
school repairs, the development

45:50.000 --> 45:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of new curricula and
installation of teacher
trainers at each
of the six schools.

45:56.067 --> 46:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attention she earned during
the Ebola crisis, including
being named a "TIME" magazine

46:01.533 --> 46:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Person of the Year, has opened
the doors to philanthropists.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meyler hopes to raise $25
million over the next five
years to expand to 500 schools.

46:12.367 --> 46:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, ultimately, she hopes
the partnership project is so
successful that the private

46:16.333 --> 46:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
partners can
relinquish their roles.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE MEYLER: Our goal here
is to go out of business.

46:20.567 --> 46:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I can tell you, for
us, we're successful when
we're not needed anymore.

46:23.700 --> 46:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're successful when Liberia's
government can run these
schools, and the teachers are

46:28.467 --> 46:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at capacity, and Liberia
doesn't need to have all
these -- the external support.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what
we working toward.

46:35.467 --> 46:39.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: While she
hopes to go out of business
in a more prosperous future

46:39.467 --> 46:44.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liberia, for her own future,
Meyler says she has no plans
to leave her adopted country.

46:46.067 --> 46:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro
in Monrovia, Liberia.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told
Stories Project at the

46:56.800 --> 47:00.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota.

47:09.100 --> 47:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now to another in our Brief
But Spectacular series.

47:12.400 --> 47:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In honor of Black History Month,
we turn to poet Clint Smith,
a doctoral student at Harvard

47:18.433 --> 47:19.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

47:19.633 --> 47:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He studies racial
inequality in the U.S.

47:21.633 --> 47:26.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his first full-length
collection of poems, "Counting
Descent," was published in 2016.

CLINT SMITH, Harvard University:

while they were in office.

47:32.867 --> 47:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George Washington, when you
won the revolution, how many of
your soldiers did you send from

47:37.433 --> 47:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a battlefield to
the cotton field?

47:39.433 --> 47:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How many had to trade in
their rifles for plows?

47:41.533 --> 47:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you blame the slaves who ran
away to fight for the British,
because at least the Redcoats

47:45.700 --> 47:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were honest about
their oppression?

47:47.833 --> 47:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Thomas Jefferson, when
you told Sally Hemings
that you would free her
children if she remained

47:51.200 --> 47:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
your mistress, did you
think there was honor
in your ultimatum?

47:53.700 --> 47:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you think we wouldn't
be able to recognize the
assault in your signature?

47:56.900 --> 48:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does raping your slave, when
you disguise it as bribery,
make it less of a crime?

48:01.433 --> 48:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you wrote the Declaration
of Independence, did you ever
intend for black people to have

48:05.200 --> 48:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
freedom over their
bodies, James Madison?

48:07.433 --> 48:10.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you wrote to Congress
that black people should count
as three-fifths of a person,

48:10.667 --> 48:14.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
how long did you have
to look at your slaves
to figure out the math?

48:14.167 --> 48:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was it easy to chop them up?

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Did you think they would
be happy being more
than just half-human?

James Monroe, when you proposed
sending slaves back to Africa,
did black bodies feel like

48:22.167 --> 48:24.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rented tools?

48:24.200 --> 48:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you branded them, did
the scar on their chest
include an expiration date?

48:27.167 --> 48:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When you named the
country Liberia, were
you trying to be ironic?

48:30.433 --> 48:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does this really
count as liberation?

48:32.200 --> 48:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Andrew Jackson, was the Trail
of Tears not enough for you?

48:35.667 --> 48:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was killing Cherokee, Choctaw,
Creek, Seminoles not enough
to quench your imperialism?

48:43.167 --> 48:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How many brown bodies
do you have to bulldoze
before you can call it
progress, Mr. Washington,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe, Jackson?

48:49.033 --> 48:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you put your hand on the
Bible and swore to protect this
country, let's be honest in

48:52.533 --> 48:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who you were talking about.

48:54.567 --> 48:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the first Independence
Day fireworks set the sky
aflame, don't forget where we

48:57.967 --> 49:00.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were watching from.

49:00.567 --> 49:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you remember
Jefferson's genius, don't
forget the slaves who
built the bookshelves

49:02.967 --> 49:05.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his library.

49:05.500 --> 49:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you remember
Jackson's victories in
war, don't forget what he
was fighting to preserve.

49:08.433 --> 49:12.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you sing that this country
was founded on freedom, don't
forget the duet of shackles

49:12.467 --> 49:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dragging against the
ground my entire life.

49:15.300 --> 49:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been taught how perfect
this country was, but no one
ever told me about the pages

49:20.233 --> 49:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
torn out of my textbooks, how
black and brown bodies have been
bludgeoned for three centuries

49:24.500 --> 49:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and find no place
in the curriculum.

49:27.833 --> 49:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oppression doesn't disappear
just because you decided not
to teach us that chapter.

49:31.700 --> 49:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you only hear one side of
the story, at some point, you
have to question who the writer

49:37.267 --> 49:39.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

49:39.900 --> 49:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm a third-year graduate
student at Harvard University.

49:49.500 --> 49:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I study broadly the
history of racial inequality
in the United States.

49:53.100 --> 49:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I taught high school English
for several years in Prince
George's County, Maryland.

49:56.833 --> 50:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of what I always
think about is how important
it is to complicate history.

50:00.800 --> 50:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The presidents and the founding
fathers and all of the people
we sort of raise up as false

50:07.867 --> 50:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idols, we don't wrestle with
the fact that many of these
were brilliant men, but they

50:09.867 --> 50:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were also men with
deep prejudices against
people of color, against
indigenous people,

50:14.433 --> 50:17.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against women.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Jefferson I learned
about was the intellectual
founding father of this
country, responsible

50:19.600 --> 50:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the conception of the
Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution.

50:23.100 --> 50:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we never talked about the
fact that he owned slaves.

50:26.100 --> 50:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only after we understand
where we have come from can we
understand how we need to move

50:30.100 --> 50:31.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Clint Smith.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take on complicating
the history of the United

50:36.133 --> 50:38.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

50:38.100 --> 50:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can
find additional Brief But
Spectacular episodes on our Web

50:41.533 --> 50:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

50:47.433 --> 50:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now to a "NewsHour" Shares.

50:49.867 --> 50:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2006, after billionaire
businessman Warren
Buffett announced that
he was giving away

50:53.400 --> 50:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much of his fortune,
people started writing him
letters asking for help.

50:57.467 --> 51:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He turned them over to his
sister, who has been responding
to them ever since as part

51:01.633 --> 51:03.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a foundation.

51:03.133 --> 51:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tina Martin from PBS station
WGBH in Boston has the story.

51:09.900 --> 51:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: These letters are
from people from all across
the country who are desperate

51:13.933 --> 51:16.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for help.

51:16.433 --> 51:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NONI CAMPBELL, Letters
Foundation: Somebody would
say, I'm on disability
and I need dentures

51:20.800 --> 51:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I don't have any money.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Could you help me with dentures?

51:23.733 --> 51:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: Some
are handwritten.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Others are typed.

51:27.167 --> 51:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they all come to the Letters
Foundation, run by billionaire
Warren Buffet's older sister,

51:32.100 --> 51:34.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Doris.

51:34.133 --> 51:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She started reading letters
at the request of her brother,
who was being flooded with

51:36.867 --> 51:41.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pleas for help.

51:41.200 --> 51:45.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Noni Campbell is a
longtime friend of Doris,
lovingly called Dodo.

51:45.667 --> 51:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They met more than a decade ago.

51:47.733 --> 51:52.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NONI CAMPBELL: She had a blue
sofa in her condo up in Maine,
and she would be sitting

51:54.133 --> 51:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in one little corner of it,
and the entire rest of the sofa
was piled with letters from

51:57.067 --> 51:59.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people, boxes and boxes.

51:59.167 --> 52:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: All of those
boxes came with Doris Buffett
when she moved to Boston, but

52:02.300 --> 52:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she needed help reading them;
1,200 people volunteered.

52:10.267 --> 52:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Emily Holland was one of them.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMILY HOLLAND, Letters
Foundation: I think we
don't want to believe
how easy it is to

52:14.500 --> 52:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fall into a situation that's
overwhelming or that we feel
like we can't get out of.

52:21.067 --> 52:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Volunteers are
being trained over the next
several weeks, but not everyone

52:26.200 --> 52:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will read letters,

52:28.200 --> 52:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY KINGMAN, Letters Foundation:
We actually created a new
role, which are the group -- a

52:30.267 --> 52:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of people who are
here training today, and
those are our researchers.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The researchers
will verify people's
identities and stories.

52:37.300 --> 52:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also make sure requests
fulfill the foundation's
mission of making
one-time grants to help

52:43.167 --> 52:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them get back on their feet.

52:44.800 --> 52:47.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Unfortunately,
businesses is brisk.

52:47.067 --> 52:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TEVIS SPEZIA, Letters
Foundation: Since we
have been in Boston,
we have given out about

52:49.833 --> 52:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
260,000 in the
fiscal year of 2016.

52:53.500 --> 52:58.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In total, we have given out
about a little over 300,000 now.

52:58.467 --> 53:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We give any sorts of grants
upwards of $35,000 in a case
like that that's a handicap van,

53:05.500 --> 53:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you have to spend a little
bit more to provide the vehicle,
and then smaller amounts

53:10.300 --> 53:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover some utilities and
help people get back on their
feet can be as small as $200,

53:14.800 --> 53:16.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
$300.

53:16.867 --> 53:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: While the
foundation operates
with a strict budget,
there is no budget when

53:20.000 --> 53:22.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it comes to giving.

53:22.067 --> 53:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TEVIS SPEZIA: If anyone has
worked closely with Doris, she
always speaks about how she

53:24.333 --> 53:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants her last check to bounce.

53:25.767 --> 53:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The Buffett
family is also very hands-on.

53:28.867 --> 53:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 89, Doris isn't
always in the office, but
talks with staff daily.

53:35.733 --> 53:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of her personal
touch, like how people are
required to make a request with

53:38.500 --> 53:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
old-fashioned letters.

53:40.533 --> 53:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIMI ROZEK, Letters Foundation:
She really loves the personal
connection of a handwritten

53:43.400 --> 53:45.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
letter.

53:45.467 --> 53:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's how the program really
started, too, with Warren,
was people writing and sending

53:47.433 --> 53:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in physical letters.

53:49.433 --> 53:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: And Mimi Rozek,
Doris' granddaughter, promises
they read every letter.

53:53.100 --> 53:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIMI ROZEK: It's very humbling.

53:55.233 --> 53:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at times, it's a little
bit stressful, just because
sometimes we can't help with

53:58.767 --> 54:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of them for various
reasons, but the vast
majority, we are able to help.

54:02.267 --> 54:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's really great.

54:03.933 --> 54:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," I'm
Tina Martin in Boston.

54:06.933 --> 54:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's
an inspiration.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:10.333 --> 54:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
