JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.667 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.833 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Brexit begins.

00:09.333 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Theresa May gives
formal notice, starting the
two-year process of Britain's

00:15.200 --> 00:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
divorce from the European Union.

00:17.367 --> 00:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: The invisible wounds of
war -- why so many veterans
struggle to get past the stigma

00:24.067 --> 00:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of PTSD in order to
get the help they need.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAYA MARSHALL (RET.), U.S.
Army: A lot of times, I did
say, OK, well maybe it is my

00:30.100 --> 00:32.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emotions.

00:32.233 --> 00:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe I do just need to push
those aside and just toughen
up and just move forward and

00:36.733 --> 00:39.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drive on.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And restoring
Florida's Everglades - -
why the ailing wetlands
are at the center

00:43.800 --> 00:45.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of a complex political
and scientific battle.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GRUNWALD, Author, "The
Swamp: The Everglades, Florida
and the Politics of Paradise":

00:47.933 --> 00:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's covered in this flocculant
glop that looks like guacamole
and smells like crap.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's not just an
environmental problem.

00:57.633 --> 00:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's an economic
catastrophe for that area.

00:59.967 --> 01:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.700 --> 01:10.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.567 --> 01:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The clock is
ticking tonight on Britain's
withdrawal from the European

01:19.833 --> 01:21.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Union.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
London got things started
today, nine months after the
British people voted to quit the

01:25.667 --> 01:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political and economic bloc.

01:27.933 --> 01:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, begins our coverage.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: In accordance
with the wishes of the
British people, the

01:34.633 --> 01:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United Kingdom is leaving
the European Union.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: With that,
the British government
formally launched the process.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, Britain's ambassador to
the European Union delivered
official notice to its president

01:48.633 --> 01:50.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Brussels.

01:50.167 --> 01:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then, Prime Minister Theresa
May addressed Parliament.

01:52.767 --> 01:57.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY: This is an
historic moment from which
there can be no turning back.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Britain is leaving
the European Union.

02:01.367 --> 02:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to make our own
decisions and our own laws.

02:05.133 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Reaction on the
street was as mixed today as it
was in last June's referendum,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which passed 52 to 48 percent.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PIPER, Great Britain:
I said to my wife, all
I want to do before I
die is see my country

02:16.900 --> 02:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
free of the shackles of Europe.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICOLA GIBSON, Great Britain:
No one how this is going to go.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a gamble.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a risk.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a bit like -- it's just
an uncertain place at moment.

02:25.933 --> 02:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: But
the European Council
president, Donald Tusk,
lamented the occasion.

02:32.933 --> 02:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: There is no reason
to pretend that this is a happy

02:35.800 --> 02:38.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day, neither in
Brussels nor in London.

02:38.367 --> 02:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Then-Prime
Minister David Cameron called
last year's Brexit referendum,

02:45.867 --> 02:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping it would fail, and
boost his Conservative
Party's prospects in the
next general election.

02:50.633 --> 02:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after the surprise
result, Cameron stepped down,
leaving its execution to May.

02:57.167 --> 03:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.K. has two years to
hammer out the specific
of its withdrawal from
the 27-nation bloc.

03:02.767 --> 03:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But face-to-face talks
aren't expected to get
under way until late May.

03:07.233 --> 03:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the negotiations
promise to be tough.

03:10.933 --> 03:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British Finance Minister Philip
Hammond said he expects some
give and take, but added:

03:15.333 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP HAMMOND, British Finance
Minister: I'm confident, as
we have explored over the

03:18.733 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last nine months with
our E.U. partners, that
we have a sufficient
meeting of minds on this

03:25.700 --> 03:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue, that we will be able
to reach a deal that will
work for us and work for them.

03:29.233 --> 03:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: As for
the U.S., then-candidate
Donald Trump praised Brexit.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, his White House
spokesman commented.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: Whatever future
the U.K.-E.U. relationship

03:39.633 --> 03:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
looks like, we want
the U.K. to remain a
strong leader in Europe.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Margaret Warner.

03:47.567 --> 03:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will hear
from the British ambassador to
Washington right after the news

03:53.033 --> 03:55.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. military announced that its
review of a disputed airstrike

03:57.900 --> 04:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Iraq is now a
formal investigation.

04:00.500 --> 04:05.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Local officials in Mosul say
the March 17 strike killed
at least 100 civilians.

04:07.500 --> 04:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the top U.S. American
commander for the Middle East,
General Joseph Votel, appeared

04:12.267 --> 04:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at a congressional hearing.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said the investigation will
examine a number of factors.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH VOTEL, Commander, U.S.
Central Command: This was a
very dynamic situation, so this

04:19.100 --> 04:21.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wasn't a deliberate
target or anything else.

04:21.967 --> 04:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was an evolving combat
situation, so we will take a
look at the intelligence that

04:26.433 --> 04:29.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was provided to us by
the Iraqis that we had.

04:29.567 --> 04:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will look at the enemy's
reaction here, and we will try
to understand exactly their

04:36.133 --> 04:38.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
role in this.

04:38.133 --> 04:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Votel also said
the Islamic State is using
human shields in Mosul, in

04:43.733 --> 04:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an effort to exploit
American concerns about
killing civilians.

04:46.733 --> 04:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, President Trump told
lawmakers last night -- and I
quote -- "We are doing really

04:51.300 --> 04:53.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well in Iraq."

04:53.633 --> 04:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China and the European Union
today stood by their commitments
to the Paris accord on climate

04:59.600 --> 05:01.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

05:01.733 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That follows President Trump's
actions aimed at rolling back
the push for deep cuts in

05:06.467 --> 05:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

05:08.533 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Beijing, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman said that his
government is not changing its

05:13.567 --> 05:15.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stance.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator):
We still believe the

05:17.233 --> 05:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Paris agreement was hard-won.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The international community,
including China and
the United States, made
positive contributions.

05:26.133 --> 05:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All sides should move with the
times, grasp the opportunities,
fulfill their promises

05:29.200 --> 05:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and earnestly take proactive
steps to jointly push the
enforcement of this agreement.

05:33.567 --> 05:38.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
European Union voiced regret
about President Trump's move.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president formally
launched a new commission
on opioid abuse today.

05:43.933 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He heard from recovering
addicts and others.

05:47.033 --> 05:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The group included New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie, who
will chair the commission.

05:51.233 --> 05:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Newark, two
former aides to Christie were
sentenced to prison for causing

05:57.433 --> 05:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
huge traffic jams
on a major bridge.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The move was aimed at a
Democratic mayor who'd
refused to endorse Christie.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's daughter Ivanka
said today that she will serve
as an unpaid federal employee.

06:12.033 --> 06:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, Ivanka Trump
said she's taking that step to
address ethics questions that

06:17.900 --> 06:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were raised after an earlier
announcement that she'd be an
informal adviser to her father,

06:22.267 --> 06:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with an office in
the White House.

06:24.233 --> 06:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a federal employee,
she's obliged to comply with
government ethics rules.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, on Wall Street, energy
stocks were up, banks stocks
were down, and the indexes were

06:34.333 --> 06:35.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mixed.

06:35.933 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 42 points
to close at 20659.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 22 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added two.

06:44.667 --> 06:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Brexit officially begins -- I
speak with the U.K.'s ambassador

06:52.133 --> 06:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the U.S.; the uncertain
prospects of finding
common ground in Congress;
horrific conditions

06:58.067 --> 07:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Bangladesh's leather
tanneries; and much more.

07:12.633 --> 07:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we return to Brexit and
Great Britain's official move
today to begin the process of

07:18.500 --> 07:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leaving the European Union.

07:20.567 --> 07:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
the British ambassador to the
United States, Sir Kim Darroch.

07:26.467 --> 07:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I began by asking if he
thinks the head of the European
Union, Donald Tusk, was right

07:31.400 --> 07:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when he said this is not a
happy day in London or Brussels.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH, British
Ambassador to the United States:
I wouldn't put it like that,

07:37.067 --> 07:39.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

07:39.067 --> 07:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a clear democratic
decision by the British people,
52 percent to 48 percent on

07:44.233 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that famous day,
June 23 last year.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's now about
delivering what the
British people asked for.

07:50.333 --> 07:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, for me, it's an outcome
of democracy, it's a decision.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we now need to get
the best possible deal
for the British people.

07:59.067 --> 08:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when Mr.
Tusk says it's not a win for
either side, that it's more

08:02.967 --> 08:07.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about damage control,
what would you -- how
would you describe it?

08:07.067 --> 08:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: Well, I think
it's an opportunity for us to
establish, as the prime minister

08:11.933 --> 08:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said today, a deep and lasting
and serious partnership with
the European Union, which

08:19.400 --> 08:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covers security issues,
which covers economic
issues, and which has at its
heart a new comprehensive

08:26.733 --> 08:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free trade agreement, which
will be a huge benefit to both
sides of the negotiations,

08:33.033 --> 08:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both to the U.K. and
to the European Union.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
you about the prime minister's
letter to Mr. Tusk today,

08:41.533 --> 08:43.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the European Union.

08:43.467 --> 08:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among others things, she
referenced rising protectionist
instincts around the world.

08:48.733 --> 08:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She mentioned security
worries across Europe.

08:52.100 --> 08:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She talked about weakening
-- she said, "Weakening
our cooperation would
be a costly mistake."

08:58.533 --> 09:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That seems to contradict
the very idea of leaving.

09:01.033 --> 09:03.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why leave the union
if these are concerns?

09:03.467 --> 09:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: Well, the
British people wanted to leave
the European Union, for a

09:10.100 --> 09:13.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
number of reasons, which
people will be analyzing
for some time to come.

09:13.367 --> 09:18.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think regaining control
of our borders and restoring
the full sovereignty of the

09:21.000 --> 09:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
British Parliament were
big parts in that decision.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the point about the
proposition that we are
putting to the European
Union in the prime

09:28.500 --> 09:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
minister's letter is
that, as committed free
traders and people who
believe in open markets,

09:35.867 --> 09:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we think we can have
a comprehensive free
trade arrangement with
the European Union

09:39.800 --> 09:42.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will be of great
benefit to both sides.

09:42.367 --> 09:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it doesn't have
to be lose-lose.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can be win-win.

09:46.533 --> 09:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
prime minister, also a
couple of points in the
letter, she referred

09:52.500 --> 09:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to what she called a deep
and special partnership that
Britain desires with the E.U.

09:58.300 --> 10:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to turn that question
around, why would the E.U. want
a special partnership with a

10:03.933 --> 10:05.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country that has just said,
we want no part of you?

10:05.167 --> 10:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SIR KIM DARROCH: Well,
we didn't say that.

10:07.300 --> 10:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We say that we're leaving the
European Union because that's
the decision the British people

10:11.333 --> 10:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
took, but we're
not leaving Europe.

10:13.933 --> 10:18.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we're part of Europe
geographically, and
we're going to continue
to be part of Europe's

10:18.467 --> 10:23.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
future in terms of the
challenges Europe faces,
security, economic
development and so on.

10:26.667 --> 10:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, we're the sixth
biggest economy in the world and
a huge market for the European

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Union to send its goods,
its manufactured goods,
its products into.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe they will find
it very much in their interest
to come to an agreement

10:43.967 --> 10:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with us which allows the
freest possible access for
those -- all those exports.

10:48.733 --> 10:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think people
want to understand how this new
relationship is going to work.

10:53.633 --> 10:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the prime minister today,
again, in the letter spoke of
a bold and ambitious, in her

11:00.167 --> 11:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
words, fair trade agreement
between the U.K. and the E.U.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How is that going to
be different from the
current relationship?

11:05.667 --> 11:10.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: Well, as she
also has said in Parliament
today, while we're in the single

11:13.200 --> 11:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
market, we are part of the
body that makes the rules of
the single market, decisions

11:19.400 --> 11:22.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about regulation and
that kind of thing.

11:22.067 --> 11:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We accept that, as we leave
the single market, we will no
longer be in that position, but

11:26.967 --> 11:31.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that doesn't stop us having
access, as full access as we
can negotiate for both sides,

11:34.333 --> 11:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for them into the U.K. and
for us into Europe, for
our goods and our services.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's the objective.

11:42.267 --> 11:46.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How worried are
you and others in the leadership
of the British government

11:48.033 --> 11:51.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the economic cost to
Great Britain, jobs being moved
out of the country, companies

11:55.600 --> 11:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moving out,
businesses, employers?

11:57.733 --> 12:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: I mean, so
far, since the decision of 23
June last year, actually, the

12:03.733 --> 12:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
British economy has thrived.

12:07.200 --> 12:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have the second highest
growth -- highest rate in the
G7 last year, and it's looking

12:12.933 --> 12:14.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
good again this year.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had one of the strongest
economies amongst the major
countries for some time

12:20.533 --> 12:21.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I'm confident
about the future.

12:25.133 --> 12:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that, if we can
achieve the sort of objectives
the prime minister's set out,

12:31.600 --> 12:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it can be to our benefit and
to Europe's benefit as well.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conversely, you know, if we
weren't to get the kind of
free trade arrangements that we

12:40.067 --> 12:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enjoy now and that we hope to
get to a free trade agreement
in the future, it would damage

12:44.533 --> 12:46.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both sides.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see the sense in
arriving at an outcome that
is damaging to both sides.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm hopeful about
progress in this negotiation.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, let me
ask you about the comment from
the White House press secretary,

12:57.133 --> 12:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sean Spicer, today.

12:59.833 --> 13:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, whatever future
the U.K.-E.U. relationship
looks like, he said, we
want the U.K. to continue

13:06.367 --> 13:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be a strong leader in Europe.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that possible under
these circumstances?

13:11.600 --> 13:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: We are,
apart from being a very open
economy, and a great leader in

13:15.933 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free trade, we're also engaged
in -- all over the world, we
have our military in over 70

13:22.000 --> 13:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries around the world.

13:24.033 --> 13:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're big players, for
example, in the action against
Da'esh in Iraq and Syria and

13:28.600 --> 13:29.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Libya.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's all
going to continue.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Indeed, we may do
more in the future.

13:34.133 --> 13:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think everything
points to us continuing
to be big international
players and very strong

13:40.367 --> 13:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
allies for the United States.

13:42.333 --> 13:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sir Kim Darroch,
the British ambassador to
the United States, thank you

13:46.867 --> 13:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

13:48.633 --> 13:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH: Thank you.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back on this side
of the Atlantic, some of the
political spotlight was on the

14:02.567 --> 14:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle over filling the vacant
seat on the U.S. Supreme Court

14:06.567 --> 14:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Republicans push for a
vote as soon as possible for
President Trump's appointee,

14:11.500 --> 14:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch, and Democrats
grow increasingly vocal in
their opposition, the Republican

14:17.933 --> 14:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Democratic leaders in the
Senate today stood their ground.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: So when we hear our
Democratic colleagues talking

14:25.067 --> 14:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about breaking longstanding
precedent to oppose
this noncontroversial,
outstanding judge by

14:31.133 --> 14:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mounting the first ever
purely partisan filibuster
to try to defeat his
nomination, we can only

14:35.767 --> 14:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assume one thing.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't about
the nominee at all.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: If Judge Gorsuch
fails to earn 60 votes, and

14:43.333 --> 14:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fails to demonstrate he is
mainstream enough to sit on the
highest court, we should change

14:49.200 --> 14:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the nominee, not the rules.

14:52.267 --> 14:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans are the ones
making the choice to go nuclear.

14:56.167 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
this and what is next after
the failed Obamacare repeal and

15:03.067 --> 15:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
replace push, and the drama
over the Russia connection
investigation, we turn to Karine

15:07.000 --> 15:08.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jean-Pierre.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's a senior adviser
for MoveOn.org.

15:10.833 --> 15:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Matt Schlapp, he's chair of
the American Conservative Union.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And welcome back to both
of you to the program.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Karine, I'm going
to start with you.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have listened
to these senators.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know what's going
on in the background.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What does it look like
this Gorsuch nomination
is headed towards?

15:26.167 --> 15:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist: I have to say,
truer words couldn't have been

15:29.300 --> 15:31.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spoken by Mitch McConnell.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's absolutely right.

15:33.533 --> 15:37.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are in a -- this country,
our democracy is being certainly
threatened, I should say,

15:40.800 --> 15:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we have a president
who's under investigation
- - well, his associates
are under investigation.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And until that is cleared up,
we should figure out what's
going on and get to the bottom

15:51.267 --> 15:53.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we shouldn't be allowing
a lifetime appointment to
the Supreme Court justice.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I totally agree.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is something -- it's
not just about the nominee.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's about where we
are as a country.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But,
Matt -- excuse me.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16:04.133 --> 16:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Matt, it sounds like
Leader McConnell is not prepared
to slow this thing down.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White
House Director of Political
Affairs: Not at all.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Neil Gorsuch is going to
be on the Supreme Court.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody knows it.

16:13.700 --> 16:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, do they mount
this filibuster and do the
rules of the Senate have to be

16:18.500 --> 16:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
changed to get him on the court?

16:20.567 --> 16:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I predict that they won't
have to change the rules
to get him on the court.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He will get over 50
votes, mostly because...

16:24.800 --> 16:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other words,
you're saying Democrats, some
Democrats will come on board?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think
-- or they won't choose
to mount a filibuster.

16:30.967 --> 16:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, we don't --
modern times, they don't
use the filibuster against
Supreme Court nominees.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is quite a precedent.

16:38.933 --> 16:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, it plays into what Harry
Reid did in not allowing the
60-vote threshold for nominees

16:43.367 --> 16:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of President Barack Obama.

16:45.433 --> 16:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what's happening in the
Senate is it's turning into
something more like the House,

16:48.133 --> 16:52.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it just takes a majority
vote to get - - and, of
course, the Senate only handles

16:52.467 --> 16:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominations, but just a majority
vote to get people through.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, quite frankly,
as a conservative, I'm
just fine with that.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
would be a much more partisan
place if that happens, right?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

17:03.367 --> 17:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hey, I think, if Mitch McConnell
brings Gorsuch to the floor,
and he can't get to 60 votes,

17:09.333 --> 17:13.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey, there is another nominee
named Merrick Garland who
waited -- he waited 293 days.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:16.700 --> 17:18.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: He did.

17:18.667 --> 17:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But
the Republicans didn't
have any problem with that.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This seat has been
open for over a year.

17:21.933 --> 17:25.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why can we not wait to see
where this investigation goes?

17:25.167 --> 17:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think
because it has nothing to
do with the investigation.

17:27.767 --> 17:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to do with the fact that
that opening, which was the
swing seat, happened in relative

17:34.133 --> 17:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
proximity to the election.

17:36.267 --> 17:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Republicans made the
case that we shouldn't make
that decision on that swing

17:40.533 --> 17:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
justice until the
election was decided.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The election was decided.

17:44.867 --> 17:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now Donald Trump has picked
somebody who we have to all
admit performed very well during

17:50.033 --> 17:52.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hearings.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even the Democrats I have
talked to said it would have
helped our cause a lot if he

17:54.567 --> 17:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seemed to be less sure-footed.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
But here's the thing.

17:57.967 --> 18:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merrick Garland was a
consensus candidate that
Republicans should have been...

18:01.667 --> 18:02.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:02.900 --> 18:03.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: So is
Neil Gorsuch, though.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:04.833 --> 18:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
No, he's not.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He never even answered questions
about how he voted when it
came to women's rights, when

18:08.133 --> 18:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it came to LGBT rights.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He actually didn't even
answer those questions.

18:11.067 --> 18:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: He said that he
-- his opinions didn't matter.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What mattered is the
black letter of the law.

18:16.467 --> 18:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All
right, we're not going to
resolve this in this week.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We may try at it --
we may go at it again.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:22.000 --> 18:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, the
Intelligence Committee, Matt,
chairman of House Intelligence

18:25.333 --> 18:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee, Devin Nunes, a lot
of controversy, questions about
whether he can be a credible

18:31.200 --> 18:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leader for that investigation.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do you see that going?

18:35.533 --> 18:39.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, he and other
Republicans in the House
and even Republicans in
the Senate are saying

18:39.767 --> 18:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is going to stay as it is.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: My hat's
off to Democrats.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they're doing a good
job of trying to make it about
Devin Nunes and about the

18:47.167 --> 18:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judgments he's made as chairman.

18:49.233 --> 18:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have talked to the chairman
and his team over the course
of the last days and weeks.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the information that he
believes that he's uncovered
doesn't have -- doesn't relate

18:58.633 --> 19:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Russia.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reason why he went
to the White House
doesn't relate to Russia.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it does relate to the fact
that he's got more witnesses
who have come forward to say

19:05.767 --> 19:10.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, during the ending days
of the Obama administration
or ending weeks and months,

19:12.633 --> 19:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there was more surveillance
that captured even more
conversations of team Trump.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is all going to come out.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to see it publicly.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the American people
are going to be faced
with this question about,
is this surveillance

19:22.800 --> 19:26.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power that a president
has, is it too broad?

19:26.067 --> 19:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this sounds
like, Karine, something that's
just going to get bigger.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, it
definitely seems like it's
just going to get bigger.

19:32.433 --> 19:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, we -- from --
historically, both the
House and the Senate,
when it comes to the

19:36.400 --> 19:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Intelligence Committee, it
behaves above board, outside of
politics, which is the beauty of

19:43.933 --> 19:45.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these two committees.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we haven't seen
that from this chair.

19:46.367 --> 19:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He continuously does
things that's troubling.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm not just saying
this as a progressive.

19:51.467 --> 19:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had Senator McCain say,
hey, his behavior last week was
troubling, that you cannot trust

19:57.900 --> 19:59.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what's going on.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have lost their
credibility, the
House Intel Committee.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, that...

20:02.267 --> 20:04.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:04.333 --> 20:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Good old Senator
McCain, you can always count
on him to criticize his own

20:06.300 --> 20:07.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's pretty good at
that, I have to say.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Hey,
he's pretty credible as well.

20:11.067 --> 20:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
two other things I want
to quickly ask you both.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a lot, I know, to cram in.

20:14.267 --> 20:18.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Karine, health care, the
attempt to repeal and replace,
didn't come up for a vote.

20:20.033 --> 20:22.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans seem
to have regrouped.

20:22.667 --> 20:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think Democrats
are prepared to work with
the president on this?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

20:27.567 --> 20:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I can't
imagine that's going to happen.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I will tell you why.

20:30.700 --> 20:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they put forth 20 days
ago now was very draconian.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was pretty unbelievable
that they had seven years, and
this is what they came up with,

20:40.400 --> 20:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is a bill that took
health care away from tens of
millions of people, raised costs

20:45.133 --> 20:47.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the most vulnerable,
including seniors.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I can't imagine
that what -- what are they
were going to come up with?

20:50.167 --> 20:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why should we trust them, when
they had years to put something
forth that would be appeasing,

20:58.067 --> 21:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or why not just work with the
Democrats and say, hey, we know
that Obamacare needs fixing,

21:03.933 --> 21:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
let's work with you guys?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
do you see it going?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think you make
a lot of good points there.

21:08.733 --> 21:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did run around the country
for six or seven years and said
Obamacare was an abomination

21:11.567 --> 21:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we have a replacement.

21:13.567 --> 21:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we look bad when the
first attempt to have a repeal
and replace, we stumbled and

21:18.767 --> 21:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't get the votes.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't even think they were
that close to getting the votes.

21:22.367 --> 21:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think, when you have
a mandate in Obamacare says
you must get health insurance,

21:26.200 --> 21:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and then when you take
the mandate away, there
is no question there
will be people -- it's

21:29.233 --> 21:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called freedom -- who will
choose -- as a young man, I
didn't get health insurance.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People have a right
to make that choice.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Matt, do you think the
Republicans will try again?

21:36.433 --> 21:38.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: I do.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the White House
is already working to try
to get something done.

21:40.567 --> 21:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They realize, Judy, we cannot
credibly go back to the voters
next November without having

21:44.600 --> 21:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a real vigorous
replacement of Obamacare.

21:47.133 --> 21:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In less than
30 seconds, the announcement
by the president's daughter,

21:50.833 --> 21:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt and Karine, that she will
be an unpaid federal government
employee with an office

21:56.600 --> 21:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House.

21:57.433 --> 21:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We now have
the president's daughter and
son-in-law with offices in the

22:00.833 --> 22:01.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
West Wing.

22:01.833 --> 22:02.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Unusual.

22:02.833 --> 22:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What should we...

22:03.833 --> 22:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: It's unusual.

22:04.833 --> 22:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's all be honest.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's unconventional.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But here's what I have learned
in working for a president.

22:09.533 --> 22:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Presidents will seek out the
advice that they feel like they
need to make the tough calls.

22:13.133 --> 22:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's clear, with
President Trump, his family
is very important to him as he

22:17.533 --> 22:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
determines positions on issues.

22:19.733 --> 22:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's very candid
that he wants her near him
to talk about these things.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
I think it plays into
the story of nepotism.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what are the ethics
around all of this?

22:29.967 --> 22:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's troubling.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's
incredibly troubling.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it is going
to be problematic.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Her lawyer is
a Democrat, Jamie Gorelick.

22:36.233 --> 22:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's no legal question.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is a question
about the politics of it.

22:39.533 --> 22:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
I understand that.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I understand that.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, the optics
are certainly bad.

22:43.867 --> 22:45.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the only reason we
heard an announcement
of what her position is
going to be is because

22:45.767 --> 22:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they were responding to
watchdogs, saying, hey,
this doesn't look good.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now she says
she will be a formal government
employee, subject to ethics

22:53.267 --> 22:54.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All these...

22:55.567 --> 22:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: And
she's a Democrat.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all those Democrats who
were complaining, you might like
the fact that she's in there.

22:59.333 --> 23:00.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:00.933 --> 23:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well,
I think she's an enabler.

23:02.800 --> 23:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank
you both, Karine
Jean-Pierre, Matt Schlapp.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thank you so much, Judy.

23:17.300 --> 23:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly four years
ago, an industrial building in
Bangladesh collapsed, killing

23:27.167 --> 23:32.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more than 1,100 people,
highlighting the dangers
faced by workers in the
textile industry there.

23:34.133 --> 23:37.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's much less known are
the conditions in the leather
industry in Bangladesh,where

23:37.967 --> 23:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers are exposed to toxic
chemicals, and where the waste
has created one of the world's

23:42.133 --> 23:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dirtiest manufacturing sites.

23:44.567 --> 23:49.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Producer Justin Kenny
and photojournalist
Larry Price traveled to
the country's capital,

23:50.433 --> 23:52.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dhaka, for an inside look.

23:52.467 --> 23:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report was produced in
partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting.

23:55.933 --> 23:58.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Hari Sreenivasan narrates.

23:58.067 --> 24:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Setting foot
in the Hazaribagh neighborhood
is an assault on the senses.

24:04.667 --> 24:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The scene is seemingly
post-apocalyptic, the
stench overwhelming and
almost vomit-inducing,

24:10.133 --> 24:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a combination of garbage,
human waste, rotting animal
hides and toxic chemicals.

24:18.067 --> 24:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The source of those hides and
chemicals are tanneries like
these, hundreds of them packed

24:22.867 --> 24:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into two square miles.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The facilities are often
dark and suffocating.

24:28.100 --> 24:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Workers rarely wear protective
gear, and it doesn't take
long to find children toiling

24:32.900 --> 24:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
away in dangerous conditions.

24:35.233 --> 24:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In earlier December,
local media reported
that two 12-year-old
workers were severely

24:41.600 --> 24:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
burned at a wallet factory
in the neighborhood.

24:44.533 --> 24:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our team found this 10-year-old
boy working in plain sight,
despite the fact that Bangladesh

24:50.700 --> 24:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prohibits work by anyone
under 18 at a tannery.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PEARSHOUSE, Human
Rights Watch: The children are
doing the most dangerous and

24:56.967 --> 25:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most hazardous types of
work that's possible in the
tanneries, just like the adults.

25:03.933 --> 25:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The children are in the pits
working with chemicals, in
essentially vats full of acid.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Richard
Pearshouse of Human Rights
Watch has made regular
visits to Hazaribagh

25:11.467 --> 25:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and was the lead author of a
2012 report on the district.

25:14.533 --> 25:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PEARSHOUSE: Each time,
I would spend a period of time
in Hazaribagh, seven days,

25:21.467 --> 25:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 days, I would fall sick with
some of the illnesses I was
witnessing in the people who

25:26.000 --> 25:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were living there
and working there.

25:28.033 --> 25:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to overstate how
polluted Hazaribagh is.

25:35.033 --> 25:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a residential area, where
tens of thousands of people are
living, but it's a cluster of

25:40.633 --> 25:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 200 leather tanneries
who are operating sometimes 24
hours a day with huge amounts

25:48.133 --> 25:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of hazardous chemicals.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Bangladeshi government
has acknowledged that
21,000 cubic meters

25:53.933 --> 25:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of untreated tannery wastewater
is dumped every day into the
Buriganga River that runs

26:00.533 --> 26:04.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
through Dhaka, one of
the world's most densely
populated cities.

26:04.767 --> 26:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were granted permission to
visit inside six tanneries to
see firsthand what conditions

26:10.367 --> 26:12.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were like.

26:12.433 --> 26:17.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unlike workers here in the U.S.,
the Dhaka tannery workers wore
no gloves, goggles, respirator

26:18.433 --> 26:20.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
masks, or boots.

26:20.233 --> 26:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
At some locations, they
were found inside vats
filled with chemicals.

26:25.033 --> 26:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was no
decontamination process.

26:28.733 --> 26:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Many simply washed
chemicals off their body
with a bucket of water.

26:31.733 --> 26:34.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER VAN GEEN,
Columbia University:
The tanneries shouldn't
operate in this fashion.

26:34.667 --> 26:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexander
Van Geen is a geochemist at
Columbia University who has

26:38.700 --> 26:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worked on groundwater
issues in Bangladesh.

26:40.800 --> 26:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDER VAN GEEN: The workers
in the tanneries are exposed to
levels of chemicals, chromium

26:47.533 --> 26:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and others that are not
acceptable and are avoidable.

26:53.700 --> 26:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Action is certainly needed.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That chemical
exposure is leading to both
short- and long-term medical

26:59.733 --> 27:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conditions, according to
Dr. Mir Masudur Rhaman,
who treats tannery workers.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:06.167 --> 27:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIR MASUDUR RHAMAN, Bangladesh:
Lung disease, mainly asthma,
bronchitis, lung cancer, urine

27:12.133 --> 27:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bladder cancer, reproductive
tract infection, and also other
diseases like stomach discomfort

27:19.467 --> 27:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or gastroenteritis.

27:21.600 --> 27:26.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's
surprising is that many
workers are left in the
dark about chemicals

27:27.133 --> 27:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they are exposed to.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This man is in his '50s
and says he's worked in
the industry for 20 years.

27:33.033 --> 27:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION (through
translator): Are you aware
of the dangerous chemicals
being used in tanneries?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
No, I am not aware of them.

27:39.133 --> 27:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
Do you take any protection
while you're working?

27:42.700 --> 27:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): No.

27:44.733 --> 27:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He and
other workers we spoke to said
they were happy to have a job

27:48.600 --> 27:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a country where 40 percent
of the population lives on
less than a $1.25 a day.

27:55.067 --> 27:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's not just the workers
who are exposed in Hazaribagh.

27:58.300 --> 28:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tens of thousands of residents,
including small children
who play in the tanneries'

28:02.433 --> 28:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dumping grounds, encounter the
chemicals in tannery wastewater
that is released untreated

28:08.867 --> 28:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through spouts straight
into neighborhood streams.

28:10.933 --> 28:15.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PEARSHOUSE: That
combination of heavy
chemically intensive
industry in essentially

28:17.533 --> 28:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a densely packed
residential environment
makes for a toxic mix.

28:22.500 --> 28:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite being
more than 7,000 miles from the
United States, your connection

28:26.900 --> 28:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Hazaribagh's nearly
$1-billion-a-year leather
industry could be as
close as your feet, back

28:33.000 --> 28:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pocket or waist.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How can you tell?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, oftentimes, you cannot.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER WHITE, Documentary
Filmmaker: Consumers
have no way of knowing.

28:40.167 --> 28:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Heather White,
now a documentary film director
and producer, spent decades

28:44.033 --> 28:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping major brands source
their products in an ethically
and environmentally responsible

28:49.000 --> 28:51.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

28:51.067 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says that the supply
chain in Bangladesh
and other developing
nations is often tainted

28:56.333 --> 28:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by abusers of environmental
and labor standards.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER WHITE: It's completely
mission impossible, for customs
inspectors, for consumers, for

29:05.333 --> 29:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people who want to know
transparently what went
on in the production
of the end product,

29:12.700 --> 29:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the subcontractors'
invoices, shipping
documents, they don't
travel with the shipment.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brands could
completely require it.

29:20.067 --> 29:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the brands basically have
no incentive to do so, because
they profit from the fact

29:26.600 --> 29:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a lot of the stuff is
hidden and consumers aren't
going to know about it.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Perhaps even
more surprising for American
consumers is that the country

29:32.600 --> 29:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of origin made-in labels
frequently don't reveal
the nation or region
where source materials

29:38.333 --> 29:40.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or goods come from.

29:40.367 --> 29:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER WHITE: For example, they
could primarily sourced from
Asia, but if the finishing was

29:43.833 --> 29:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done in a factory in Italy,
it's going to come into the
U.S. with a made in Italy or

29:48.633 --> 29:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a made in Europe label.

29:50.733 --> 29:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: White and
others attribute the economic
growth of Bangladesh's leather

29:54.933 --> 29:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industry to a lack of
enforcement of local laws.

29:58.367 --> 30:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Child labor, lack of protective
equipment for workers and the
dumping of untreated wastewater

30:05.267 --> 30:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are all illegal in the
country, but industry still
operates in the neighborhood.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tanneries have yet to abide
by a 15-year-old Bangladesh
high court order requiring them

30:16.433 --> 30:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to relocate to an industrial
area on the outskirts
of Dhaka with a common
wastewater treatment

30:20.267 --> 30:21.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plant.

30:21.267 --> 30:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The plant is not complete.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the tanneries have been slow
to rebuild operations there.

30:25.767 --> 30:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some tannery owners say
they don't want to move
because of the cost.

30:30.133 --> 30:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this month, the high
court ruled again on the issue
and ordered the government to

30:33.800 --> 30:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cut power, gas and
water to the tanneries.

30:37.033 --> 30:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The order was upheld by
the country's Supreme
Court days later.

30:40.633 --> 30:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the tanneries
are still operating.

30:43.200 --> 30:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PEARSHOUSE: So,
essentially, the government
is playing a game where
they say, the tanneries

30:47.000 --> 30:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are on the verge of moving.

30:49.233 --> 30:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can't enforce our
laws until they move.

30:53.033 --> 30:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that decision not
to enforce the laws means is
that the health of the workers

30:59.200 --> 31:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the local residents
continues to suffer.

HARI SREENIVASAN: It's still
unclear whether the government
will act and if Hazaribagh

31:05.433 --> 31:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will this time finally see
change or more pollution.

JUDY WOODRUFF: For the record,
we asked the Bangladesh Embassy
here in Washington repeatedly

31:16.667 --> 31:17.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for comment.

31:17.467 --> 31:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they declined.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to our special three-night
look at the efforts to treat,
diagnose and possibly find

31:35.067 --> 31:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a cure to post-traumatic
stress disorder.

31:37.900 --> 31:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One in five U.S. military
personnel serving in combat
will suffer some form of PTSD.

31:44.833 --> 31:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it often goes untreated
because of the stigma
associated with the disorder.

Tonight, special correspondent
Soledad O'Brien begins our
series, War on the Brain.

31:56.833 --> 32:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Almost every day, at some point,
I would relive the IED attack.

32:03.867 --> 32:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was like I couldn't turn
my mind off, like I was being
flooded, like a cyber-attack,

32:09.600 --> 32:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reliving that explosion
like a broken record.

32:12.733 --> 32:15.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It just kept playing,
and I couldn't stop it.

GREG GADSON (RET.), U.S. Army:
I remember I was driving,
and I opened my window, and

32:20.400 --> 32:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I turned my radio up,
and I got it to stop.

32:23.300 --> 32:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was like it left an imprint
on me, and I didn't even
know where it came from.

32:30.267 --> 32:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Army Colonel
Greg Gadson was blown out
of his passenger's seat by a

32:33.100 --> 32:34.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
roadside bomb.

32:34.467 --> 32:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was in Baghdad 2007.

32:37.033 --> 32:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His physical injuries were
so severe, doctors assumed he
would suffer from post-traumatic

32:42.633 --> 32:43.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stress disorder.

32:43.967 --> 32:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he was too
embarrassed to accept it.

32:46.467 --> 32:51.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did you find it so hard
to really believe that you
had post-traumatic stress?

COL.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG GADSON: It wasn't something
that I could identify with.

32:55.500 --> 33:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, as an athlete, as a
-- as an officer, as a leader,
we're trained to override pain,

33:03.933 --> 33:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to override doubt.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Both his legs
were amputated above the knee.

33:09.633 --> 33:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He had permanent nerve
damage, limited function
in his right arm.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gadson underwent 22 surgeries.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was in rehab for 18 months.

33:18.733 --> 33:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His abilities greatly diminished
from his college glory days.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Trying
to get off the pass,

Great defense by Greg

SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Gadson
played football at the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Co-captain and outside
linebacker, powering
through was in his DNA.

33:38.967 --> 33:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Greg
Gadson right here, he's got
terrific football instincts.

33:43.733 --> 33:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: You're
a football player.

33:46.133 --> 33:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're a leader.

33:48.567 --> 33:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you're all these
sort of almost stereotypes,
right, of like the
tough guy in all capital

GREG GADSON: Right.

33:57.367 --> 33:58.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you can say macho
if you want to say that.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Yes,
OK, I will say macho.

34:00.733 --> 34:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, how much did your
reluctance to get help was that
this macho stereotype was kind

34:05.333 --> 34:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of going to stand
in the way of that?

34:07.733 --> 34:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

100 percent of it.

34:08.533 --> 34:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Yes?

COL.

34:11.567 --> 34:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GADSON: I mean, every
tough challenge in my
life, I fought through.

34:15.233 --> 34:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I -- and so
I was committed to fighting
through it again, and without

34:21.633 --> 34:23.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help.

34:23.700 --> 34:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: I was very
surprised that of the one in
five people who get diagnosed

34:29.667 --> 34:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with post-traumatic stress
disorder, like, half of
them don't get treatment.

GREG GADSON: Right.

34:35.833 --> 34:37.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: A massive

GREG GADSON: Right.

SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Stigma
surrounding post-traumatic
stress disorder sometimes
discourages vets

34:44.967 --> 34:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from seeking treatment.

Good.

SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The VA's
chief mental health consultant

34:52.800 --> 34:54.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:54.867 --> 34:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROLD KUDLER, Chief Consultant
for Mental Health Services,
Department of Veterans Affairs:

34:56.933 --> 34:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most important thing to
remove the stigma from PTSD is
for people to talk about it,

34:58.400 --> 35:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, in talking about it, not
fall into the stereotypes.

35:00.700 --> 35:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For people who have PTSD,
they're at risk for depression,
for substance abuse.

35:05.500 --> 35:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're at high risk for
suicide, largely because of the
nature of PTSD, to think about

35:10.367 --> 35:15.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the world and yourself
in negative terms, and
this idea that nothing
could ever go right.

35:17.333 --> 35:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: To get to the
heart of how stigma hinders
treatment, we assembled a panel

35:23.333 --> 35:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of veterans who struggle
with PTSD, with assistance
from the Military
Service Initiative of the

35:27.967 --> 35:29.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bush Institute.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They help reintegrate
returning veterans.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think being visibly
wounded made it easier to
have post-traumatic stress?

35:42.167 --> 35:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DREW BARNETT (RET.), Former
U.S. Navy SEAL: Absolutely.

35:42.967 --> 35:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Really?

35:44.933 --> 35:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Army Sergeant DeWitt

SGT.

35:49.167 --> 35:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEWITT OSBORNE: I think
it's more acceptable when
you have visible wounds.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: It
would make sense to us.

SGT.

35:53.533 --> 35:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DEWITT OSBORNE: It
makes sense, all right?

35:55.300 --> 35:56.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ours is hidden.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Doesn't mean we don't suffer
as much, but it's hidden.

SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Kevin Rosenblum

KEVIN ROSENBLUM (RET.),

pressure , both internal

36:09.667 --> 36:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and external, to be infallible,
to be strong at all times,
and never show weakness was

36:18.167 --> 36:19.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I didn't want to
let my soldiers down.

36:23.700 --> 36:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In his
first deployment to Iraq,
his unit came under fire.

36:28.233 --> 36:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He received treatment for the
shrapnel in his right leg,
but not for his post-traumatic

36:35.267 --> 36:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN ROSENBLUM: I saw a doctor
when I got out, as everybody
does, and just talked through

36:39.833 --> 36:41.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some things.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, yes, I think you
have post-traumatic stress.

36:43.700 --> 36:44.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What

CAPT.

36:46.967 --> 36:50.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN ROSENBLUM: I guess I
just minimized it in my mind
and thought that this is the

36:51.600 --> 36:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toll of service in war.

36:54.700 --> 36:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Special Agent
Drew Barnett, who served with
Navy seals in Afghanistan,

37:00.967 --> 37:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refused to believe
that he had PTSD.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DREW BARNETT: During my early
training in the Navy, one
of our instructors said, you

37:07.133 --> 37:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, hey, guys, it's better
to die than look stupid.

37:09.967 --> 37:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just make sure
you don't do both.

37:12.033 --> 37:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in thinking about that,
I realized that is a lot of
the mind-set that we have, is,

37:16.700 --> 37:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't want to, one, look
weak, or we don't want to be
someone who is not dependable.

37:21.500 --> 37:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And there
is Maya Marshall, part of the
15 percent of service members

37:26.433 --> 37:27.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who are female.

37:27.933 --> 37:30.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She left the Army as a
sergeant after five years.

37:30.967 --> 37:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shame, she says, kept her from

37:36.067 --> 37:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAYA MARSHALL (RET.), U.S.
Army: It came from combat, yes,
but, OK, you have only been to

37:38.867 --> 37:40.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
combat one time.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have only been in the
service for this long.

37:41.867 --> 37:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt that they would be
like OK, you're a female.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just get your feelings out
of it, and just toughen up.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So, you thought
maybe you didn't deserve it?

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAYA MARSHALL: Yes.

37:53.033 --> 37:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: You
hadn't seen enough combat.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAYA MARSHALL: Yes.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: You
hadn't been in long enough.

37:56.667 --> 37:57.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're a girl.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAYA MARSHALL: Yes.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:00.633 --> 38:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Maybe you're...

38:01.600 --> 38:02.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAYA MARSHALL:
Maybe my emotions.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe it is my emotions.

38:05.133 --> 38:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of times, I did say, OK,
well, maybe it is my emotions.

38:07.267 --> 38:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe I do just need to push
those aside and just toughen
up and just move forward and

38:08.233 --> 38:09.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drive on.

38:09.967 --> 38:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Photography is
Gadson's passion and therapy.

38:17.067 --> 38:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He uses the chair more often
than his prosthetics, so he can
have the freedom to capture his

38:22.667 --> 38:24.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pictures.

38:24.067 --> 38:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You never use the word
disorder or the D in disorder.

38:27.433 --> 38:28.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

38:28.433 --> 38:30.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

38:30.533 --> 38:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GADSON: Well, D to me is
-- it's a negative label that
doesn't need to be attached.

38:36.767 --> 38:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the face
post-traumatic stress
are those that wear the
uniform, less than 1 percent

38:42.000 --> 38:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of our population.

38:43.633 --> 38:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that word can be
associated and labeled with all.

38:47.467 --> 38:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all have some level
of post-traumatic stress.

38:50.833 --> 38:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does it make us dysfunctional?

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For most of us, I would say not.

38:55.100 --> 39:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Gadson pushed
back hard against his diagnosis,
until his wife intervened.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM GADSON, Wife of Col. Greg
Gadson: He threw a number of
mental health professionals out

39:04.000 --> 39:06.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of his room when he
was in Walter Reed.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
He kicked them out?

39:08.700 --> 39:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM GADSON: Just kicked them
out, or just chewed them up
and spit them out like they

39:11.100 --> 39:13.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were nothing.

39:13.200 --> 39:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What do
you think has helped him
accept a PTS diagnosis
and that he actually

39:18.200 --> 39:19.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
needs help?

39:19.667 --> 39:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIM GADSON: I think the
fact that it stays with him.

39:23.233 --> 39:24.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It stays with him.

39:24.867 --> 39:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's gotten treatment.

39:26.433 --> 39:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's working at moving
forward on his life.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's doing a lot of great
things, but every now and
then, there's an episode.

39:34.367 --> 39:39.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's something he realizes:
I can't always control this,
so I have to keep working at

39:40.400 --> 39:41.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

39:41.533 --> 39:43.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
Gadson's made progress.

39:43.067 --> 39:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Despite his injuries, he cycles
and occasionally downhill skis.

39:46.633 --> 39:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tours the country making
dozens of motivational speeches
to soldiers and civilians.

39:53.467 --> 39:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome
Colonel Greg Gadson.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

39:58.467 --> 40:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Part of his
message: Don't let shame get
in the way of getting help.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

40:03.367 --> 40:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GADSON: For veterans,
what I want to say is, look,
we're always out there for each

40:07.100 --> 40:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other, but you have got
to take the first step.

40:10.433 --> 40:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Display the courage, the courage
that in some cases that you
have displayed in all your

40:14.567 --> 40:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entire military
career, to go get help.

40:17.100 --> 40:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Soledad O'Brien
in Alexandria, Virginia.

40:24.133 --> 40:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow,
our series continues with a look
at the challenges of diagnosing

40:28.833 --> 40:33.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
PTSD.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Billions of dollars have
been spent trying to restore
the Florida Everglades.

40:39.433 --> 40:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are concerns that
those efforts are not working.

40:43.100 --> 40:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Duarte
Geraldino reports for our weekly
report on the Leading Edge

40:47.933 --> 40:50.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of science.

40:50.467 --> 40:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVELYN GAISER, Florida
International University:
This is the microbial
community that forms

40:52.833 --> 40:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the basis of the food
web of the Everglades.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Scientist
Evelyn Gaiser has spent her
entire adult life getting her

41:00.467 --> 41:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
feet wet, studying the
microscopic animals
and plants living in
the Florida Everglades.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN GAISER: There are
so many different types of
habitats that occur in it.

41:09.200 --> 41:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's so many different ways
that water flows through it,
both above ground and below

41:14.767 --> 41:16.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ground.

41:16.367 --> 41:17.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DUARTE GERALDINO:
That complexity hides
a lot of secrets.

41:17.567 --> 41:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EVELYN GAISER: The
ecosystem is changing.

41:19.733 --> 41:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Gaiser
runs the Coastal Everglades
Ecological Research Program.

41:23.633 --> 41:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She and her students
have found previously
unknown life forms here.

41:27.433 --> 41:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVELYN GAISER: They have
not been discovered in
science, so my students
actively name species.

41:32.400 --> 41:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: This
incredibly rare and biodiverse
habitat is also critical to the

41:37.067 --> 41:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
survival of birds, reptiles and
ultimately millions of people.

41:41.167 --> 41:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN GAISER: It is a real
lifeblood, not only for the
organisms that we see here, but

41:46.800 --> 41:48.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for us as well.

41:48.800 --> 41:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's our source of fresh
drinking water, of the potable
water that we use and the water

41:54.133 --> 41:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we irrigate our
farm fields with.

41:56.233 --> 41:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Over the last
century, the natural footprint
of the Everglades was reduced

41:59.700 --> 42:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by almost half to make room
for roads, homes and farms.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To do that, swampland had to
be drained and freshwater was
channeled out to the coasts,

42:10.833 --> 42:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving the southern
region vulnerable to rising
seawater encroachment.

42:12.933 --> 42:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVELYN GAISER: The
saltwater is creeping in.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DUARTE GERALDINO: OK,
so you're saltwater.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm freshwater.

42:17.133 --> 42:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVELYN GAISER: That's right.

42:19.267 --> 42:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so there's that
kind of push-pull in the
wet and dry season that
would happen naturally.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you don't have
enough freshwater moving
in, the saltwater is
just going to move in,

42:27.733 --> 42:30.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in, in, in.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And rising
sea levels, accelerated
by global warming, mean
forests of mangroves

42:35.133 --> 42:38.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are moving far inland, killing
off the natural habitat.

42:38.067 --> 42:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2000, federal lawmakers
implemented an ambitious plan
to restore the original essence

42:43.800 --> 42:45.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Everglades.

42:45.867 --> 42:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After decades of commercial and
agricultural development, the
U.S. government was in effect

42:49.600 --> 42:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to broker a deal
between development and nature.

42:53.567 --> 42:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But nature is fighting
back, humbling engineers
and threatening the
drinking water of roughly

42:58.167 --> 43:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
eight million people.

43:00.233 --> 43:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD GONZALES, Comprehensive
Everglades Restoration Plan:
So, what you see behind

43:01.933 --> 43:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you is a water control
structure that's going
to manage the water.

43:05.400 --> 43:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO:
Howard Gonzales is the
engineer in charge of
implementing the plan, which

43:09.233 --> 43:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is officially called the
Comprehensive Everglades
Restoration Plan, or CERP.

43:16.233 --> 43:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a plan designed to build
canals, bridges and reservoirs
to ensure ample drinking water,

43:22.867 --> 43:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
protect communities
from flooding, and to
clean and- control water
flow to the Southern

43:26.133 --> 43:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Everglades.

43:28.233 --> 43:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When it was signed into
law, it contained 68
different components at
a cost of $8 billion.

43:34.067 --> 43:37.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That price tag has now more
than doubled, and not a single
project is complete yet.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of the problem is,
there's still so much about the
Everglades we don't understand.

43:44.367 --> 43:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD GONZALES: The science
has evolved, and we continue to
adaptively manage our program

43:49.200 --> 43:51.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to meet those new
science understandings.

43:51.267 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And yet
Gonzales says the projects are
still proceeding according to

43:55.600 --> 43:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the original timetable.

43:57.133 --> 44:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD GONZALES: We have nine
projects under construction.

44:00.767 --> 44:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have at least six of
our foundation projects
that were started back
in the mid-'90s that

44:05.500 --> 44:07.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are nearing completion.

44:07.567 --> 44:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you look at those in
total, it shows that we're
making great progress.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: The
Tamiami Highway is one
example of that progress.

44:13.600 --> 44:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For nearly 90 years, it
acted like a dam, preventing
freshwater from flowing south to

44:19.467 --> 44:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Everglades National Park.

44:22.067 --> 44:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the Army Corps
of Engineers elevated a
one-mile section of the
road and is currently

44:27.533 --> 44:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working to raise two more miles,
so water can flow more freely.

44:31.100 --> 44:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the state has also built
some stormwater treatment
areas, which use plants to scrub

44:37.533 --> 44:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clean agricultural water before
it flows into the Everglades.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But journalist Michael Grunwald,
author of "The Swamp: The
Everglades, Florida and the

44:45.967 --> 44:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politics of Paradise,"
says the plan has not
accomplished its main goal.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GRUNWALD, Author, "The
Swamp: The Everglades, Florida
and the Politics of Paradise":

44:51.467 --> 44:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The real thrust of
CERP is supposed to be
about storing water.

44:54.100 --> 44:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, well, we're 17
years in, and they still
haven't built any storage.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: No storage?

44:59.867 --> 45:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GRUNWALD: They
haven't built any storage.

45:02.067 --> 45:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They aren't planning to
build enough storage.

45:05.133 --> 45:07.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there's no plan B.

45:07.167 --> 45:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Right
now, the main place to store
water is Lake Okeechobee.

45:10.967 --> 45:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when water levels get too
high, managers are forced to
release the untreated water,

45:17.167 --> 45:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sending it out to the
east and west coasts.

45:19.800 --> 45:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last summer, that dirty
water caused unprecedented
algae blooms on Florida's
lakes and coastlines.

45:26.367 --> 45:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was so bad, Governor
Rick Scott declared
a state of emergency.

45:29.233 --> 45:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GRUNWALD: It's covered
in this flocculant glop that
looks like guacamole and smells

45:36.000 --> 45:37.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like crap.

45:37.267 --> 45:40.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's not just an
environmental problem.

45:40.167 --> 45:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's an economic
catastrophe for that area.

45:42.433 --> 45:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: So, is this
Nature fighting back now?

45:44.200 --> 45:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GRUNWALD: Mother
Nature gets the last word.

45:46.567 --> 45:50.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: About the
only thing as complex as the
science associated with the

45:50.767 --> 45:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everglades is its politics.

45:53.467 --> 45:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is big money,
especially sugar money,
attached to these lands.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL ORSENIGO, Farmer: It's $2.5
billion of economic activity.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DUARTE GERALDINO:
Billion with a B.

46:01.833 --> 46:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Billion with a B --
in Palm Beach County.

46:03.933 --> 46:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Paul Orsenigo
farms lettuce, vegetables and
sugarcane near Belle Glade.

46:10.933 --> 46:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the fertile area south
of Lake Okeechobee that was
once part of the Everglades.

46:13.967 --> 46:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL ORSENIGO: We have been
blessed with some of the best
soil types in the whole world

46:19.567 --> 46:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on planet Earth.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a productive, successful
society and nation, if
you looked at history,
is based on productive

46:28.400 --> 46:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
soil and farmland.

46:30.433 --> 46:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But farms
like Orsenigo's may become
part of the storage solution.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To prevent another toxic
algae bloom, a group
of state lawmakers is
proposing the restoration

46:43.067 --> 46:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
timetable be sped up and that
farmers give up their land,
so a 60,000-acre reservoir

46:47.700 --> 46:50.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be built years ahead of
the original CERP schedule.

46:50.867 --> 46:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The price tag is $2.4 billion.

46:53.400 --> 46:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL ORSENIGO: I think there are
better solutions than buying and
taking more productive farmland.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BASORE, Business Owner:
So, we have about 85 people
that work at this particular

47:03.333 --> 47:05.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
facility.

47:05.333 --> 47:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: STEPHEN
BASORE OWNS A FARM AND
VEGETABLE PROCESSING PLANT.

47:07.300 --> 47:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BASORE: Every time
that agricultural land has been
taken out of production, it

47:11.433 --> 47:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets a lot more challenging
for my family's operation.

47:14.133 --> 47:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: He employs up
to 1,000 people at peak season.

47:18.200 --> 47:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BASORE: If you take
agriculture out of here, you're
basically just wiping all

47:22.767 --> 47:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these jobs out, and
there's nothing to
come in and replace it.

47:26.633 --> 47:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: He says
Florida farmers have already
given up 100,000 acres of land

47:31.267 --> 47:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was used to reestablish
wetlands, and they shouldn't
be asked to give more for a

47:35.733 --> 47:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system that is not
fully understood.

47:38.233 --> 47:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Davis, an ecologist with
the Everglades Foundation,
is sympathetic to the loss of

47:45.200 --> 47:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farm jobs, but warns the
state will take an even bigger
economic hit if the problem is

47:49.733 --> 47:51.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not fixed.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN DAVIS,
Everglades Foundations:
We're a tourist-based
economy in Florida.

47:53.767 --> 47:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If people are canceling their
summer vacation trip to these
coastal areas, restaurants,

47:59.533 --> 48:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hotels, a much larger sector of
our economy is being affected.

48:03.167 --> 48:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: He says
the science is clear:
More freshwater has to
be stored and channeled

48:08.900 --> 48:11.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
south.

48:11.033 --> 48:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN DAVIS: This is the mix
of habitats you would find in
more of a restored or natural

48:15.833 --> 48:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
area of the Everglades.

48:17.933 --> 48:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: He took us
deep into the marsh, where
alligators are king, to show

48:20.633 --> 48:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us how if, given the right
conditions, this incredibly
rare system can heal itself.

48:27.067 --> 48:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN DAVIS: It's almost
like your immune system.

48:29.100 --> 48:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you get a viral infection,
your body has a tendency to
fight it off, and will continue

48:34.800 --> 48:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to fight it off
as long as it can.

48:36.600 --> 48:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the resilience
of the Everglades is
very similar to that.

48:40.300 --> 48:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We see the system improves
under marginal conditions.

48:47.267 --> 48:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we can only restore that
flow of freshwater back to the
south, we know that we will see

48:49.567 --> 48:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a significant boost in
the health of the system.

48:52.367 --> 48:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: A system that
is critical to the biological
and economic health of the

48:58.100 --> 48:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entire state of Florida.

48:59.733 --> 49:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From the Everglades,
I'm Duarte Geraldino
for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:07.500 --> 49:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
you will want to listen closely.

49:14.867 --> 49:18.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We explore the sounds
that shaped the cultural
history of America.

49:18.567 --> 49:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each year, the Library of
Congress selects 25 examples of
audio it considers significant

49:24.967 --> 49:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the National
Recording Registry.

49:27.533 --> 49:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a wide-ranging list, from
Judy Garland singing "Over the
Rainbow" to stand-up comedy

49:33.267 --> 49:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by Richard Pryor.

49:34.800 --> 49:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our guide is the librarian
of Congress, Carla Hayden.

49:38.200 --> 49:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN, Librarian of
Congress: The registry is
the Library of Congress'
tribute to significant

49:48.633 --> 49:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sound recordings, not only
music, but actually sound
of significant events.

49:58.967 --> 50:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The recordings that are selected
this year and also the over
400 recordings that have

50:05.900 --> 50:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been selected for the registry
over the years are all preserved
and made available at the

50:11.733 --> 50:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Library of Congress' Culpeper
facility, the Packard Center.

50:15.400 --> 50:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The facility curates and also
preserves over four million
items, and more are coming.

50:25.233 --> 50:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a combination of comedy.

50:28.733 --> 50:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have Richard Pryor.

50:34.600 --> 50:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have jazz, Wes Montgomery.

50:41.600 --> 50:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a cylinder that
goes back to 1888 that really
captures what sound recording

50:49.567 --> 50:54.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was at that time, really
demonstrating we have to
preserve what we hear.

50:56.400 --> 51:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baseball is one of those
universal American experiences.

51:04.333 --> 51:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so many people share
time and space and stadiums.

51:10.967 --> 51:14.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And they also shared it,
as my grandfather did,
listening on the radio.

51:14.267 --> 51:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what the selection is meant
to represent each year is the
variety of sound recording

51:22.167 --> 51:27.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the differences
in different genres.

51:28.733 --> 51:32.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"Straight Outta Compton"
was performed by a
seminal rap group, NWA.

51:35.700 --> 51:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was heralded as a song and
a group that made a difference
in terms of that genre being

51:44.033 --> 51:49.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taken seriously.

51:51.467 --> 51:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy Garland, "Over the
Rainbow," I was surprised that
it hadn't been selected already.

51:58.467 --> 52:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think there are
many people that haven't looked
at either the film or listened

52:03.600 --> 52:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to that song and thought
about Judy Garland singing it.

52:10.733 --> 52:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Bowie really exemplified
evolution in performance.

52:17.700 --> 52:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a song that united so
many people, and it's talked
about and used so many times,

52:24.433 --> 52:28.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"We Are Family"
by Sister Sledge.

52:28.967 --> 52:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Judy Collins recorded
"Amazing Grace" in 1970, it
was a symbol of forgiveness, of

52:40.867 --> 52:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
striving, and just emotional
and spiritual depth.

52:47.767 --> 52:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Renee Fleming, in terms of
opera, of course, is someone
who has made such a difference.

52:58.567 --> 53:03.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Music, in particular, can unite
so many people, and that we
are all joined by the sound of

53:07.300 --> 53:10.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

53:10.200 --> 53:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Makes
you want to listen to
every single one of them.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:23.067 --> 53:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:25.133 --> 53:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
