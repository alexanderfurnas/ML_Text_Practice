WEBVTT

00:08.308 --> 00:16.884
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both jobs and
wages show an increase In may,
boosting chances the Federal

00:16.884 --> 00:20.053
Reserve will start to raise
interest rates later this year.

00:20.053 --> 00:23.724
Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:23.724 --> 00:29.263
Also ahead: cyber-attack on a
massive scale. Hackers steal
personal data for millions

00:29.263 --> 00:32.499
of federal government
workers in the U.S.

00:32.499 --> 00:38.939
Then: cracking Ebola's code.
Scientists hunt for a low-tech,
accurate test to rapidly

00:38.939 --> 00:43.443
diagnose the virus before
the worst symptoms appear.

00:43.443 --> 00:48.215
MILES O'BRIEN: It's not as
accurate as the genetic
technique, but it is as easy as
a

00:48.215 --> 00:53.186
home pregnancy test. Two lines
on the left means positive for
everyone, one line on the

00:53.186 --> 00:55.489
right, negative.

00:55.489 --> 01:01.161
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the week's news.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.896
Those are some of the stories
we're covering on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:02.896 --> 01:04.631
(BREAK)

01:04.631 --> 01:10.270
JUDY WOODRUFF: It turns out the
economic recovery regained some
of its mojo in may.

01:10.270 --> 01:17.077
Today's Labor Department report
shows employers added a net of
280,000 jobs, far more than

01:17.077 --> 01:21.348
expected. The unemployment rate
ticked up to 5.5 percent as more
people were encouraged

01:21.348 --> 01:24.584
enough to look for work.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.188
All in all, it marked a rebound
from the year's first quarter.
We will delve into the data,

01:28.188 --> 01:31.124
right after the news summary.

01:31.124 --> 01:36.630
OPEC opted today not to cut its
oil output. Cartel officials
said that means the price

01:36.630 --> 01:41.068
of crude oil and, in turn, the
price of gasoline are likely to
stay relatively low for the

01:41.068 --> 01:47.541
time being. In New York, oil
closed just above $59 a barrel.

01:47.541 --> 01:52.846
On Wall Street, the economic
news raised fears that the
Federal Reserve might raise
interest

01:52.846 --> 01:58.418
rates sooner than hoped to head
off inflation. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 56

01:58.418 --> 02:05.726
points to close at 17850. The
Nasdaq rose nine points, but the
S&P 500 slipped three.

02:05.726 --> 02:12.466
For the week, the Dow and the
S&P fell not quite 1 percent.
The Nasdaq was flat.

02:12.466 --> 02:17.371
The prime minister of Greec~
today rejected conditions by
creditors for supplying more

02:17.371 --> 02:23.944
bailout money. Instead, Alexis
Tsipras insisted on debt relief.
He told Parliament that

02:23.944 --> 02:28.682
the European Central Bank, the
European commission and the
International Monetary Fund are
making

02:28.682 --> 02:31.651
-- quote -- "irrational
proposals."

02:31.651 --> 02:36.957
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
It is time for everyone to

02:36.957 --> 02:41.862
prove that they are working
towards a viable solution and
not to subjugate and humiliate

02:41.862 --> 02:45.265
an entire nation, because if
that is what they are doing,
they should know that they

02:45.265 --> 02:48.068
will have the exact
opposite effect.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.671
JUDY WOODRUFF: Athens shook up
financial markets yesterday when
it opted to defer a

02:51.671 --> 02:54.741
payment to its creditors.

02:54.741 --> 03:00.881
U.S. weapons are finally making
their way to Iraq's military,
under a program created

03:00.881 --> 03:06.953
last year. The Pentagon
confirms it's begun shipping
rifles, machine guns and other
gear.

03:06.953 --> 03:11.091
Just this week, Iraq's prime
minister, Haider al-Abadi,
complained almost none of the
promised

03:11.091 --> 03:14.394
help had been sent.

03:14.394 --> 03:19.733
Meanwhile, Tariq Aziz, Saddam
Hussein's former foreign
minister, died today in a
hospital.

03:19.733 --> 03:25.639
He was awaiting execution for
crimes against humanity.

03:25.639 --> 03:31.278
Recovery crews in China today
raised a capsized cruise ship to
help search for victims. The

03:31.278 --> 03:37.684
vessel overturned Monday night
in the Yangtze River during a
powerful storm. Nearly 340

03:37.684 --> 03:43.523
people who were on board are
still missing. Today, cranes
righted the Eastern Star and

03:43.523 --> 03:49.529
gradually lifted it to reveal
all four decks. Salvage experts
said it was a delicate
operation.

03:49.529 --> 03:53.366
XIONG WEI, Professor, Dalian
Maritime University (through
translator): The ship has a
complex

03:53.366 --> 03:57.304
structure inside, and, besides,
it was filled with water, which
caused uneven distribution

03:57.304 --> 04:01.308
of weight. We needed to make
sure the steel cables wouldn't
break in the hoisting process,

04:01.308 --> 04:04.611
so we had to fix them fast on
the ship, on account of its
entire structure.

04:04.611 --> 04:12.285
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, divers
have recovered 103 bodies, but
only 14 survivors have emerged.

04:12.285 --> 04:17.691
A stunning turnabout today in
Pakistan: Authorities announced
that eight men accused in the
attack

04:17.691 --> 04:23.697
on teen activist Malala
Yousafzai were acquitted for
lack of evidence. Reports in
April said

04:23.697 --> 04:29.870
they'd been convicted and given
life in prison. Malala was shot
in the head in 2012 by a

04:29.870 --> 04:35.175
Taliban gunman who boarded her
school bus. She had advocated
education for girls. Two

04:35.175 --> 04:39.946
other suspects were convicted,
and given life terms.

04:39.946 --> 04:45.352
Back in this country, Northern
Colorado braced for violent
storms again after tornadoes and

04:45.352 --> 04:50.824
flooding last night. No one was
hurt, but daylight showed
several homes ripped to pieces

04:50.824 --> 04:56.029
north of Denver and floodwaters
cutting through roads. The
storm system also dumped up to

04:56.029 --> 05:02.636
three feet of hail, so much that
crews had to use heavy equipment
to clear roads.

05:02.636 --> 05:08.642
A Montana woman is accusing
former House Speaker Dennis
Hastert of sexually abusing her
brother.

05:08.642 --> 05:14.347
Jolene Burdge tells ABC News it
happened when Steven Reinboldt
was in high school in

05:14.347 --> 05:20.187
Illinois and Hastert was a
wrestling coach. Reinboldt died
of AIDS in 1995, and Burdge

05:20.187 --> 05:24.391
says then-Congressman Hastert
appeared at the funeral.

05:24.391 --> 05:28.128
JOLENE BURDGE, Sister of Alleged
Victim: I just looked at him
and said, "I want to know

05:28.128 --> 05:32.933
why you did what you did to my
brother." He just stood there
and stared at me. And then

05:32.933 --> 05:38.405
I just continued to say, "I want
you to know that your secret
didn't die in there with

05:38.405 --> 05:42.375
my brother, and I want you to
remember that I'm out here."

05:42.375 --> 05:46.046
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hastert was
indicted last week on federal
charges that he agreed to

05:46.046 --> 05:53.086
pay $3.5 million to hide
unspecified misconduct.

05:53.086 --> 05:57.857
And the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Saint Paul and
Minneapolis was charged today
with

05:57.857 --> 06:02.829
failing to protect children from
sexual abuse. State prosecutors
said the archdiocese waited

06:02.829 --> 06:07.701
too long to tell police about a
priest who molested two boys.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.637
Still to come on the
"NewsHour": job growth

06:10.637 --> 06:16.843
and wage increases signal a step
in the right direction for the
economy; keeping U.S. government

06:16.843 --> 06:22.682
data out of the hands of
international cyber-spies; the
search for a reliable,
inexpensive test

06:22.682 --> 06:28.822
to diagnose Ebola; Mark Shields
and David Brooks on the week's
news; plus, why Turkey's

06:28.822 --> 06:43.370
president seeks to overhaul his
country's constitution and
expand executive power.

06:43.370 --> 06:48.475
We start with a closer look at
the surprisingly strong jobs
report for May.

06:48.475 --> 06:53.480
Many economists said it should
stem fears that the U.S. economy
was cooling after growth

06:53.480 --> 06:57.517
contracted slightly in the
first quarter of the year.

06:57.517 --> 07:01.388
Diane Swonk is senior managing
editor and chief economist for
Mesirow Financial. She

07:01.388 --> 07:03.490
joins me now from Chicago.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.292
Welcome again to the
program, Diane.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.795
So, how good is this news
that we're hearing today?

07:08.795 --> 07:09.929
DIANE SWONK, Senior Managing
Director and Chief Economist,
Mesirow Financial Holdings,

07:09.929 --> 07:12.699
Inc.: Well, it certainly was a
real step in the right
direction, as you mentioned
earlier.

07:12.699 --> 07:17.470
What we saw was very broad-based
gains in employment, with the
exception of the mining

07:17.470 --> 07:21.041
sector, which has been hit by
cuts in the oil industry. What
it showed us is, we could

07:21.041 --> 07:25.812
go through those cuts and
overcome with the job gains we
saw.

07:25.812 --> 07:31.051
We also saw the quality of job
gains improve along with the
quantity. Not only did --
professional

07:31.051 --> 07:36.489
services came back. Temporary
hires came back. Hiring of
college grads picked up

07:36.489 --> 07:40.493
a little bit. We also saw
leisure and hospitality, which
had suffered earlier in the
year, come

07:40.493 --> 07:45.365
back, and that's a sign of a
warming trend in summer bookings
for vacation season.

07:45.365 --> 07:49.669
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we saw the
unemployment rate go up. How do
we interpret that?

07:49.669 --> 07:52.872
DIANE SWONK: Well, the
unemployment rate finally went
up for the right reasons. This

07:52.872 --> 07:56.009
is the second month in a row
that we saw more people
optimistic enough to throw their
hat

07:56.009 --> 07:58.912
back in the ring and
actually look for a job.

07:58.912 --> 08:03.049
And that's something the Federal
Reserve has been waiting for,
that along with a little

08:03.049 --> 08:07.687
bit of an uptick in wages,
something that we haven't seen
in a very long time, although

08:07.687 --> 08:12.625
it's still not much. It was the
best year-on-year wage numbers
we have seen since 2011 and
really,

08:12.625 --> 08:15.328
if we want to take it back,
since 2009. And that's when
they were falling apart.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.365
So, that's a step again
in the right direction.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.701
We're inching towards a more
healing and broad-based healing
of the labor market, and

08:21.701 --> 08:23.937
that's something
we'd all welcome.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.741
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's get
to the question that I think is
on the minds of so many, and

08:27.741 --> 08:31.845
that is what's going to happen
to interest rates. The
speculation is that, because

08:31.845 --> 08:36.983
of this, the Fed is more
comfortable raising rates this
fall, but we noticed that,
yesterday,

08:36.983 --> 08:41.020
the head of the IMF, Christine
Lagarde, said no, wait until
next year.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.091
DIANE SWONK: What we're seeing
is the real tug-of-war that is
going on, the disruption

08:45.091 --> 08:49.462
that a rise in interest rate
means to financial markets both
at home and abroad.

08:49.462 --> 08:54.267
And so we have already seen
really a bloody run-up in
interest rates in terms of the
bond

08:54.267 --> 08:58.438
market. We're at 2.4 percent
today, a big jump in interest
rates. The market hadn't

08:58.438 --> 09:01.674
been pricing in liftoff, but
they're sort are go or no go.
So, now they're sort of

09:01.674 --> 09:04.611
pricing in liftoff and no stop.

09:04.611 --> 09:08.915
This is a Federal Reserve that
will be treading -- as if they
were treading on thin ice, even

09:08.915 --> 09:12.919
as the ground beneath us,
economic ground, firms. That
said, they're very conscious

09:12.919 --> 09:18.391
of the issues that Christine
Lagarde brought up, and that is
they deal with financial policy

09:18.391 --> 09:22.896
at home, monetary policy at
home, but whatever happens
abroad does show up on our
shores.

09:22.896 --> 09:27.066
And what the IMF is concerned
about is the ripple effects of
interest rate increases

09:27.066 --> 09:32.539
and how those hit emerging
markets. Those effects, we
know, could come back and come

09:32.539 --> 09:36.609
back on us. And so that's why
the Federal Reserve as it lifts
interest rates is going

09:36.609 --> 09:41.414
to do so ever so cautiously and
it's not going to do so quickly.
It doesn't want to snuff

09:41.414 --> 09:44.918
out the overall recovery and
it's very concerned as well
about the financial market
volatility

09:44.918 --> 09:46.886
that's likely to come from this.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.321
It's been almost a decade
since they raised rates.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.289
(CROSSTALK)

09:49.289 --> 09:52.325
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.
It's been a long time.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.862
And, as you were saying, it's
how gradually they raise them
that will make a lot of
difference.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.864
Diane Swonk, we thank you.

09:57.864 --> 10:04.304
DIANE SWONK: Thank you.

10:04.304 --> 10:12.946
JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI said
today it is investigating a
massive cyber-security breach

10:12.946 --> 10:18.318
at the Office of Personnel
Management. Files stored there
containing personal information

10:18.318 --> 10:22.989
on millions of U.S. government
employees, including those with
high-level security clearance,

10:22.989 --> 10:25.158
may have been compromised.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.961
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.365
JEFFREY BROWN: News reports
citing unnamed U.S. government
officials have said that China

10:32.365 --> 10:35.969
is suspected to be behind the
attacks, though there's been no
official word from the
administration.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.437
A Chinese spokesman had
this to say today:

10:39.339 --> 10:44.611
HONG LEI, Spokesman, Chinese
Foreign Ministry (through
translator): We have seen many

10:44.611 --> 10:48.848
similar media reports and
remarks about this, but are they
scientific? We know that hacker

10:48.848 --> 10:53.186
attacks are conducted
anonymously, across nations, and
that it is hard to track the

10:53.186 --> 10:56.556
source. It's irresponsible and
unscientific to always make
trumped-up presumptions without

10:56.556 --> 10:58.758
deep investigation.

10:58.758 --> 11:03.129
JEFFREY BROWN: At the White
House this afternoon, spokesman
Josh Earnest said cyber-concerns

11:03.129 --> 11:06.266
relating to China are not new.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.369
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: I can't speak to who
may or may not have

11:09.369 --> 11:13.106
been responsible for this
particular incident. But just,
as a general matter, we have
raised

11:13.106 --> 11:19.812
significant concerns about the
way that China and individuals
acting on behalf of the state

11:19.812 --> 11:23.182
of China have acted
in cyberspace.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.420
JEFFREY BROWN: So, for more, we
turn to Dmitri Alperovitch,
co-founder and chief technology

11:27.420 --> 11:29.956
officer of CrowdStrike, an
Internet security firm.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.658
Welcome back to you.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.592
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Co-Founder
and CEO, CrowdStrike: Thank
you.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.929
JEFFREY BROWN: Start with the
whodunit this time. What kind
of evidence would point

11:35.929 --> 11:39.899
to China, and would that be
government or some kind of
criminal syndicate?

11:39.899 --> 11:42.735
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, in
this case, the FBI is the lead
investigator. So, they

11:42.735 --> 11:45.872
have the evidence. They haven't
made it public, so we don't know
necessarily with

11:45.872 --> 11:49.008
certainty this was indeed China.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.245
But it follows a pattern of
behavior that we have seen from
China. You may recall

11:52.245 --> 11:55.848
earlier this year we have seen
all these intrusions into major
insurance companies, where they

11:55.848 --> 11:58.017
were collecting very similar
information on this time tens of
millions of Americans, not

11:58.017 --> 12:01.054
just government workers.

12:01.054 --> 12:05.091
So it's a pattern of activity
that we're seeing that is
clearly an indication that the
Chinese

12:05.091 --> 12:10.163
are trying to great a massive
database of personal
identifiable information,
employment

12:10.163 --> 12:14.033
records, financial records,
medical records on literally
almost the entire American
population.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.170
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, let's get
our way back into that. Let's
start this particular -- the

12:17.170 --> 12:22.308
Office of Personnel Management,
why would this particular agency
be targeted?

12:22.308 --> 12:26.045
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, the
OPM is actually doing the
background investigations on
virtually

12:26.045 --> 12:27.814
every government employee.
There are some agencies that do
it themselves, but most of

12:27.814 --> 12:31.250
the agencies are relying on OPM.

12:31.250 --> 12:35.288
That includes clearance
investigations. These are
massive forms that people fill
out with

12:35.288 --> 12:38.825
all their background
information, all their
financials, all their medical
conditions and

12:38.825 --> 12:44.597
so forth that the OPM then
investigates. So, that record
is a gold mine for both criminal

12:44.597 --> 12:47.600
actors, who would want to
conduct identity theft, as well
as nation states.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.971
JEFFREY BROWN: So, I have
reports that officials know what
kinds of data might have been
exposed,

12:51.971 --> 12:55.108
but they're still not sure,
they're not saying what was
actually taken at this point.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.743
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH:
That's right.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.146
I think, you know, this is still
an active investigation, so they
don't want to tip their

13:00.146 --> 13:02.782
hand. They don't want to alert
the adversary of what they
potentially know.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.652
JEFFREY BROWN: What could be
done with that data? What would
it be used for?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.087
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, it
depends on who is behind it.

13:08.087 --> 13:12.458
So, if it is China, if is the
nation state of China, then the
concern is really a human

13:12.458 --> 13:16.062
intelligence concern, that
they're building these massive
databases to target people.

13:16.062 --> 13:19.432
If they want to find an
individual that is working for a
sensitive government contractor

13:19.432 --> 13:23.903
or a government agency and they
know that their relative has a
medical condition or

13:23.903 --> 13:25.738
they're in debt financially,
that could be an approach that
they can use to try to recruit

13:25.738 --> 13:28.307
this individual.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.812
It can also be used to identify
potential spies that are working
for the U.S. government

13:32.812 --> 13:36.215
that are trying to penetrate
China. If it's a criminal
actor, then it's a whole other

13:36.215 --> 13:39.552
slew of concerns like identity
theft and financial fraud.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.689
JEFFREY BROWN: And that would
tie it to -- as you said
earlier, to some of these
earlier

13:42.689 --> 13:44.957
things we saw, some of the
health insurance companies,
Anthem and others, that have
happened

13:44.957 --> 13:46.926
this year.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.762
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: That's
exactly right. And those have
been attributed to China.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.899
And we know that the Chinese are
trying to collect this
information as an effort for

13:52.899 --> 13:54.701
their intelligence apparatus.

13:54.701 --> 14:00.173
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, this is a
strike against the U.S.
government, and the
administration

14:00.173 --> 14:06.979
has after all made a big effort
in this area. Does it suggest
that nothing is safe, or

14:06.979 --> 14:11.451
does it suggest that the U.S.
government has really not done
enough with its technology?

14:11.451 --> 14:14.654
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: You know,
almost half-a-decade ago, I said
that there are only two types

14:14.654 --> 14:16.556
of organizations, either
government agencies or
companies, those that know they
have been

14:16.556 --> 14:19.325
hacked and those
that don't yet know.

14:19.325 --> 14:24.297
And this case just proves that
no one is invincible in
cyberspace. Government
agencies, we had

14:24.297 --> 14:29.202
the White House getting hacked
last year, the State Department
and certainly numerous

14:29.202 --> 14:31.704
companies that are coming under
assault from nation states, from
criminal actors, and it's

14:31.704 --> 14:33.706
really inevitable.

14:33.706 --> 14:39.212
JEFFREY BROWN: I did note
officials were taking some
solace in that they detected
this.

14:39.212 --> 14:44.083
Is there better detection now,
even if there's not better
prevention at this point?

14:44.083 --> 14:46.786
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, I
actually have to compliment
them. Even though it took

14:46.786 --> 14:49.422
them a couple of months to
detect it, which sounds like a
long time, and it is, it's
actually

14:49.422 --> 14:51.958
better than the
industry average.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.495
The industry average is about
seven to eight months from the
time of a compromise to when

14:55.495 --> 14:58.931
it's being detected. They
actually did it in a couple of
months, which is great, but

14:58.931 --> 15:02.802
obviously not good enough. It
needs to be done much faster.
And you really need to

15:02.802 --> 15:05.671
prevent the attacker from
actually being able to
exfiltrate that data, to steal
that data

15:05.671 --> 15:08.841
out of the organization. That's
when you ultimately can be
successful.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.712
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, to the
extent the focus is on the
Chinese government, outrage at
the

15:12.712 --> 15:15.815
Chinese government, at the same
time, if it is them, is this
something that the U.S.
government

15:15.815 --> 15:18.217
does as well?

15:18.217 --> 15:22.288
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, this
clearly has, if it is the
Chinese government, an
intelligence

15:22.288 --> 15:25.591
focus and an intelligence
mission, so you would assume
that the U.S. government is
doing

15:25.591 --> 15:29.095
similar things in
cyberspace and beyond.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.964
So it would be hard for us to
confront the Chinese on this
issue, because it falls into

15:31.964 --> 15:36.402
that realm of national
security-related espionage that
is the norm that everyone does.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.238
JEFFREY BROWN: And very
briefly, we're focusing on some
of these big thefts, when you
come

15:39.238 --> 15:42.041
and others join us on this, but
this is going on all the time in
various forms?

15:42.041 --> 15:44.110
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Exactly.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.014
And, oftentimes, we think of
these hacks as discrete events,
a company gets hacked or

15:48.014 --> 15:50.616
an organization gets hacked,
they clean it up, and six months
later, they announce that

15:50.616 --> 15:54.487
it is another hack. What
happens in reality is that these
attackers are persistent. The

15:54.487 --> 15:59.792
minute they're kicked out of a
network, they go back in that
same day, or try to anyway.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.029
It's oftentimes a continuous
event, where you're continuously
compromised and you just

16:03.029 --> 16:05.131
discover it in
six-month increments.

16:05.131 --> 16:11.003
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Dmitri Alperovitch, thank you so
much.

16:11.003 --> 16:16.209
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Thank you.

16:16.209 --> 16:21.914
JUDY WOODRUFF: We continue now
our series of reports on Ebola
by science correspondent

16:21.914 --> 16:24.483
Miles O'Brien.

16:24.483 --> 16:30.256
Tonight, Miles looks at efforts
to create faster, more reliable
testing for the virus.

16:30.256 --> 16:38.631
MILES O'BRIEN: In the dusty,
crowded alleys of this market
town near Kambia, Sierra Leone,

16:38.631 --> 16:44.303
people stick close together and
rely on each other. Here, there
is no mistaking where

16:44.303 --> 16:50.476
Ebola has taken its deadly toll.
The quarantines are marked by
rope and plastic bags, enforced

16:50.476 --> 16:55.314
by soldiers, and monitored
by people like this man.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.782
DR. PATRICK OTIM, World Health
Organization: I owe it to the
people of Sierra Leone to

16:56.782 --> 17:00.553
give any help that I can.

17:00.553 --> 17:07.260
MILES O'BRIEN: DR. Patrick Otim
is an epidemiologist, a disease
detective from South Sudan, a
volunteer

17:07.260 --> 17:14.333
for the World Health
Organization. He helps by doing
these crucial house calls.

17:14.333 --> 17:18.604
DR. PATRICK OTIM: Where we can
closely monitor them, so that
the moment the person becomes

17:18.604 --> 17:25.111
symptomatic, we're able to
detect that and we pick them out
from the community.

17:25.111 --> 17:29.448
MILES O'BRIEN: Eleven days ago,
the mother of these two boys, 3
and 5, was transported

17:29.448 --> 17:34.553
to an Ebola treatment center.
The virus claimed her life a few
days later. Just

17:34.553 --> 17:41.460
yesterday, their father also got
sick and was also taken away.
No one here, the boys

17:41.460 --> 17:45.865
and their aunt and uncle, will
be deemed Ebola-free until 21
days after they were in contact
with

17:45.865 --> 17:49.769
someone carrying the virus
and showing symptoms.

17:49.769 --> 17:55.241
MAN (through translator): They
say that's how they have the
contain this outbreak. We

17:55.241 --> 17:59.445
wish to do it that way. But
it's been really hard for me and
my family.

17:59.445 --> 18:03.749
MILES O'BRIEN: For 11 days,
they have been unable to leave
here, and now they are in

18:03.749 --> 18:09.689
need of supplies, food and
water. The delivery is
carefully placed just outside
the cordon.

18:09.689 --> 18:15.561
Everyone, including the boys,
pitches in to get it inside.
We, too, must keep our

18:15.561 --> 18:18.664
distance as we speak with them.

18:18.664 --> 18:22.902
MAN (through translator): We're
not sure about what happens
tomorrow, but for, now

18:22.902 --> 18:27.606
we're, not feeling
any illness at all.

18:27.606 --> 18:37.450
MILES O'BRIEN: Using an
infrared thermometer, they check
for fevers; 37 degrees Celsius

18:37.450 --> 18:48.060
is 98.6 Fahrenheit.
So far, so good.

18:48.060 --> 18:59.572
But then we get a scare. It's a
102-degree Fahrenheit fever.
The second reading is

18:59.572 --> 19:06.512
no better. Then a new infrared
thermometer, still high, so
finally they pass along a
traditional

19:06.512 --> 19:12.118
thermometer. With it tucked
inside the boy's armpit, we all
hold our breath.

19:12.118 --> 19:18.357
DR. PATRICK OTIM: And, usually,
if we detect any fever, and then
immediately for anyone

19:18.357 --> 19:22.695
in a quarantine house, the
moment they have a fever, we
have to take them for testing.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.866
MILES O'BRIEN: The final
reading is borderline. But,
remember, the boy had been
toting water

19:26.866 --> 19:32.405
bottles in the hot sun, so Dr.
Otim doesn't think drastic
action is warranted. But he

19:32.405 --> 19:35.608
vows to give both
boys extra scrutiny.

19:35.608 --> 19:39.612
DR. PATRICK OTIM: The moment
they have any other symptoms,
just fever or a headache,

19:39.612 --> 19:43.382
joint pain or sore throat, then
you need to be very proactive.

19:43.382 --> 19:47.219
MILES O'BRIEN: It's an educated
guess, but a guess just the
same.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.088
Basically, you're fighting
Ebola with a thermometer...

19:49.088 --> 19:50.756
DR. PATRICK OTIM: Yes. Yes.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.825
MILES O'BRIEN: ... which seems
like you could do -- we could do
better in this day

19:52.825 --> 19:54.627
and age, right?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.229
DR. PATRICK OTIM: Yes. Yes.
Yes. It seems we could do
better, but, unfortunately,

19:57.229 --> 19:59.732
that's all we have for now.

19:59.732 --> 20:05.604
MILES O'BRIEN: So, on the front
lines, the simple thermometer
remains the primary, really

20:05.604 --> 20:12.144
the only way to sort out people
who might have Ebola, and is, of
course, terribly inaccurate

20:12.144 --> 20:17.183
and doesn't differentiate
between Ebola and any number of
other diseases.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.920
What health care workers tell us
time and again is they need
something in between the

20:20.920 --> 20:28.360
thermometer and the cumbersome
and expensive genetic testing.
Not far from the cordoned

20:28.360 --> 20:33.599
home, an old customs building
near the Ghanaian border is now
a makeshift genetic testing

20:33.599 --> 20:38.437
facility. Blood from the boys'
father comes here. Workers
handle the samples with great

20:38.437 --> 20:40.840
care and multiple safeguards.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.777
WOMAN: This bench is
the extraction bench.

20:44.777 --> 20:51.517
MILES O'BRIEN: The genetic test
is called polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR, where machines

20:51.517 --> 20:56.956
repeatedly heat and cool the
blood sample, causing the RNA in
the virus to replicate

20:56.956 --> 21:03.195
itself over and over again.
It's a precise way to determine
if a person has Ebola, but

21:03.195 --> 21:08.100
the machines are expensive,
complex and they don't provide
quick answers.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.905
WOMAN: And if you look at it,
it's almost the same curve as
this patient that is positive.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.941
MILES O'BRIEN: While
they wait for results,

21:15.941 --> 21:20.946
the father is taken to an Ebola
treatment center run by the
International Medical Corps.

21:20.946 --> 21:26.952
Doctors here must assume and
dress for the worst. And,
unfortunately, in this case,

21:26.952 --> 21:31.624
that is warranted. The genetic
test confirms the father has
Ebola.

21:31.624 --> 21:37.897
The grim verdict comes 48 hours
after the ambulance took him
away from his boys. And

21:37.897 --> 21:45.004
with Ebola, any delay can be
deadly. It's either two extra
days for the virus to spread

21:45.004 --> 21:49.241
or it means a person without
Ebola might wait two days near
patients who are very sick and

21:49.241 --> 21:55.381
extremely contagious.

21:55.381 --> 21:59.585
In Kenema, a few hundred miles
away, they're using a prototype
Ebola test that is fast

21:59.585 --> 22:01.453
and simple.

22:01.453 --> 22:05.524
MAN: Sample for Ebola.

22:05.524 --> 22:10.930
MILES O'BRIEN: The rapid test
was developed by a Colorado
company called Corgenix.
Instead

22:10.930 --> 22:17.536
of looking for genetic material,
the Corgenix test looks for
antigens, proteins on the Ebola

22:17.536 --> 22:21.740
virus surface. It's not as
accurate as the genetic
technique, but it is as easy as
a

22:21.740 --> 22:25.110
home pregnancy test.

22:25.110 --> 22:31.650
Two lines on the left means
positive for Ebola, one line on
the right negative, no Ebola.

22:31.650 --> 22:39.858
It is a low-tech solution, to be
sure. But, as it turns out, low
tech is the cutting edge

22:39.858 --> 22:42.561
in the world of
rapid diagnostics.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.264
LEE GEHRKE, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology: It's
very simple, requires no
refrigeration,

22:45.264 --> 22:48.534
no power, no special training.

22:48.534 --> 22:53.739
MILES O'BRIEN: At MIT,
biologist Lee Gehrke leads a
team that is creating,
assembling

22:53.739 --> 22:59.678
and shipping do-it-yourself
diagnostic kits designed to give
health workers in the field

22:59.678 --> 23:04.516
the ability to make their own
tests for multiple pathogens at
once, Ebola, yellow fever and

23:04.516 --> 23:10.456
dengue, for starters.

23:10.456 --> 23:15.894
The solutions contain antibodies
to these diseases, our natural
defenses. They have

23:15.894 --> 23:21.867
found a novel way to color-code
them using gold nanoparticles of
varying size. So,

23:21.867 --> 23:25.571
whichever antibodies are engaged
in battle with the disease will
leave telltale proof

23:25.571 --> 23:29.208
of what ails a patient.

23:29.208 --> 23:36.715
It's all open-source, no
patents. Gehrke says the test
costs $5 now and could get
cheaper.

23:36.715 --> 23:39.852
Why haven't we had an easier
test for Ebola sooner?

23:39.852 --> 23:44.690
LEE GEHRKE: That's a very
important question. And I
think, unfortunately, part of
the

23:44.690 --> 23:50.496
answer is economics. It boils
down to whether there are
markets for these devices
because

23:50.496 --> 23:55.301
many of these viruses appear as
hot spots and then go away.
There's no constant market.

23:55.301 --> 24:00.673
MILES O'BRIEN: But an
entrepreneur in Cambridge with
MIT and Harvard lineage believes
there

24:00.673 --> 24:05.210
is a market for a device that
strikes a balance between low
tech and high accuracy.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.614
ANITA GOEL, CEO, Nanobiosym:
Drop of blood here to the chip.

24:08.614 --> 24:13.319
MILES O'BRIEN: Anita Goel is
CEO of a startup called
Nanobiosym. Her device is
called

24:13.319 --> 24:15.454
Gene-RADAR.

24:15.454 --> 24:22.161
ANITA GOEL: So, now what is
happening is, it's processing
the blood and it's getting

24:22.161 --> 24:25.597
ready to get the RNA of the
virus. Once it gets that, then
it's going to start copying

24:25.597 --> 24:27.766
it.

24:27.766 --> 24:32.705
MILES O'BRIEN: She claims the
device is nearly as accurate as
traditional genetic

24:32.705 --> 24:37.910
testing, but that it will be 10
times cheaper. The idea is to
detect the Ebola virus before

24:37.910 --> 24:41.647
it reaches the threshold
when symptoms appear.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.950
ANITA GOEL: Whether they have
the Ebola virus or not and
quantify what that viral

24:44.950 --> 24:47.052
load is.

24:47.052 --> 24:51.190
MILES O'BRIEN: It sounds great,
but it isn't ready for prime
time yet, not enough proof

24:51.190 --> 24:55.961
that it works. MIT biologist
Lee Gehrke is skeptical.

24:55.961 --> 25:01.867
LEE GEHRKE: The disadvantage
with fancy technologies is that
they are fancy technologies.

25:01.867 --> 25:06.538
And the question is, if they're
sent to these countries, if they
break, what will

25:06.538 --> 25:08.941
happen? Can they be fixed?

25:08.941 --> 25:14.079
MILES O'BRIEN: A good question
in places like Kambia, where the
poverty is crushing.

25:14.079 --> 25:19.785
For now, Dr. Otim and colleagues
keep visiting the boy and his
family once, sometimes twice

25:19.785 --> 25:23.655
a day, wielding
only thermometers.

25:23.655 --> 25:28.594
MAN (through translator): I
feel very confident that we will
survive this. We will pull

25:28.594 --> 25:33.031
through. We are really
optimistic that we will end up
free of Ebola.

25:33.031 --> 25:39.905
MILES O'BRIEN: Sadly, his
brother, the father of the boys,
died, leaving them orphaned.

25:39.905 --> 25:45.177
Their quarantine clock is reset,
another 21 days of constant
surveillance and temperature

25:45.177 --> 25:48.947
checks, waiting to learn
if they have been spared.

25:48.947 --> 25:54.420
But, long after we leave, we get
the word they're all OK. Maybe
next time, the cures

25:54.420 --> 25:58.991
will be better and the
answers will come sooner.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.995
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Kambia, Sierra Leone.

26:02.995 --> 26:07.499
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles' next two
reports in his Ebola series air
next week. Tune in

26:07.499 --> 26:13.539
Thursday and Friday.

26:13.539 --> 26:24.016
Now to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark Shields

26:24.016 --> 26:27.753
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks, who joins us from
New Jersey.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.956
Gentlemen, it's good
to have you both.

26:30.956 --> 26:36.361
2016, David, Mark, four
candidates have entered the race
just since the last time we were

26:36.361 --> 26:38.197
together.

26:38.197 --> 26:43.035
David, let's talk about the
Democrats first. How does the
addition of Martin O'Malley

26:43.035 --> 26:47.873
and Lincoln Chafee affect the
shape of the race? Size up
their candidacies for us.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.977
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Chafee
seems a completely implausible
candidate, but he does have one

26:51.977 --> 26:55.581
issue that he will raise, where
he opposed the Iraq War. And so
Hillary Clinton supported

26:55.581 --> 26:57.182
it.

26:57.182 --> 27:01.787
And it will be interesting to
see how that plays out, whether
it's significant. I think

27:01.787 --> 27:06.024
it's probably passed its sell
date, at least in the Democratic
primaries. But that's

27:06.024 --> 27:08.193
something she will have to
talk about and defend again.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.996
Martin O'Malley is a
plausible candidate.

27:10.996 --> 27:15.133
I'm of the belief that Hillary
Clinton's major opponent is
herself and that, if she

27:15.133 --> 27:17.536
is going to come down, it is
going to be because of an error
she made or some scandal or
something

27:17.536 --> 27:21.106
like that, and nobody
else can touch her.

27:21.106 --> 27:24.543
But if something does happen to
her campaign, then he seems at
least like a plausible
president.

27:24.543 --> 27:29.081
He was a moderately successful
governor of a pretty major
state. And he presents

27:29.081 --> 27:32.551
well. And so he's more or less
plan B as it stands right now.

27:32.551 --> 27:36.188
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do
you see them, Mark?

27:36.188 --> 27:41.994
MARK SHIELDS: I see that, first
of all, Martin O'Malley,
two-term governor of Maryland,

27:41.994 --> 27:48.200
and I would agree with David, a
successful governor, and a
liberal governor with appeal

27:48.200 --> 27:53.272
to many of the constituency
groups that are active in
Democratic presidential primary

27:53.272 --> 27:55.474
politics.

27:55.474 --> 28:04.583
He was advanced positions,
progressive on same-sex
marriage, on immigrant rights.
And

28:04.583 --> 28:09.655
I think he presents a -- he's
very charismatic, he's
appealing, he's a good speaker,
plays

28:09.655 --> 28:09.922
the guitar.

28:09.922 --> 28:10.722
(LAUGHTER)

28:10.722 --> 28:11.924
MARK SHIELDS: I
mean, he's got...

28:11.924 --> 28:13.492
JUDY WOODRUFF: Important
qualifications.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.562
MARK SHIELDS: You know, but
he's got a certain bobby socks
appeal. He's got a -- he's a

28:16.562 --> 28:19.998
natural politician.

28:19.998 --> 28:26.972
But I think the threat he
represents is, Judy, he, in his
announcement, came out strongly

28:26.972 --> 28:33.278
against Wall Street and said,
you don't get to pass the
presidency back as some sort of

28:33.278 --> 28:38.650
a crown between two royal
families. So, he put Hillary
Clinton and Jeb Bush in the

28:38.650 --> 28:40.886
same category.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.890
And, believe me, that is a
popular line among people on
both sides of the political...

28:44.890 --> 28:46.091
(CROSSTALK)

28:46.091 --> 28:47.759
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you think
that could affect -- could be
a...

28:47.759 --> 28:49.294
(CROSSTALK)

28:49.294 --> 28:54.166
MARK SHIELDS: I think -- put it
this way, Judy. At this point
in -- Bill Clinton was

28:54.166 --> 29:02.174
at 6 percent, in fifth place.
Michael Dukakis was 21 point
behind. Jimmy Carter didn't

29:02.174 --> 29:06.678
even register in the Gallup Poll
for the entire year before he
was nominated. Democrats

29:06.678 --> 29:09.815
like underdogs and dark horses.

29:09.815 --> 29:14.653
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, meanwhile,
David, Hillary Clinton, the
front-runner, is out talking

29:14.653 --> 29:19.591
this week about voting rights,
naming her Republican
challengers one by one. Is this

29:19.591 --> 29:20.659
a smart tactic?

29:20.659 --> 29:22.594
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.364
First, can I note -- Mark, did
you say bobby socks appeal or...

29:25.364 --> 29:25.564
(CROSSTALK)

29:25.564 --> 29:25.931
(LAUGHTER)

29:25.931 --> 29:27.566
JUDY WOODRUFF: He did.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.635
MARK SHIELDS: I did. I
did. I did say bobby socks.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.335
(CROSSTALK)

29:30.335 --> 29:31.436
DAVID BROOKS: ... are
wearing bobby socks.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.372
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was trying not
to show that I recognized what
he was talking about.

29:33.372 --> 29:33.705
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.
That's right.

29:33.705 --> 29:34.439
(LAUGHTER)

29:34.439 --> 29:35.307
MARK SHIELDS: How
about support hoses?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.174
(LAUGHTER)

29:36.174 --> 29:39.678
DAVID BROOKS: ... second
baseman for the Red Sox.

29:39.678 --> 29:44.216
You know, I think Hillary
Clinton, it's a good issue for
her. It's an issue that
mobilizes

29:44.216 --> 29:48.320
a lot of people, especially in
the minority community. She's
clearly trying to reorganize

29:48.320 --> 29:51.723
the Obama coalition. And to do
that, she really has to get the
-- at least similar

29:51.723 --> 29:55.193
turnout levels among
African-Americans, among
Latinos.

29:55.193 --> 29:59.931
And so this is a good issue for
her. I would say that it's
still problematic in this one

29:59.931 --> 30:04.870
regard, that her last campaign
suffered because it didn't have
an overarching theme. It

30:04.870 --> 30:10.042
had a bunch of series of
targeted policies toward
specific constituencies. And
sometimes

30:10.042 --> 30:13.078
you can pay so much attention to
the polls and pick out this
issue to get that -- people

30:13.078 --> 30:16.314
and this issue to get that
person, and that you lose an
overarching theme.

30:16.314 --> 30:20.085
And I say, now that she's
dropping in the polls kind of
significantly now, at least

30:20.085 --> 30:25.190
for right now, that she needs
some big, imaginative
overarching theme to offer a new
narrative,

30:25.190 --> 30:28.827
to counter the things that are
dragging her down right now.
And microtargeting in what

30:28.827 --> 30:32.130
looks like sort of a cynical way
is not necessarily the way to
get there.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.933
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to get to
the Republicans, but what about
this voting rights that Hillary

30:34.933 --> 30:35.834
is talking about?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.904
MARK SHIELDS: I think David is
right. It works politically.

30:38.904 --> 30:43.075
But I think she's right on the
issue, Judy. I mean, we talk
about American exceptionalism.

30:43.075 --> 30:49.281
Our founding fathers limited the
right to vote to white male
property owners. Over

30:49.281 --> 30:55.754
the next 176 years, it was
expanded to include free black
slaves, male, and then
eventually

30:55.754 --> 31:02.461
to women, and then eventually to
African-Americans, and
18-year-olds, and we have
expanded democracy.

31:02.461 --> 31:08.200
And one of the great frauds that
Republicans have perpetrated
over the past generation

31:08.200 --> 31:14.873
has been this idea of voter
fraud, that people are showing
up, 31 cases in 14 years, Judy,

31:14.873 --> 31:19.377
of people stealing identity
or voting improperly.

31:19.377 --> 31:25.851
So, I think she's absolutely
right. It is our responsibility
to make voting available

31:25.851 --> 31:28.720
to as many people as
possible who want to vote.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.322
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, maybe she
can get some traction on that.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.924
Well, let's talk quickly
about the Republicans,

31:32.924 --> 31:36.061
David. Former Governor Rick
Perry threw his hat in the ring
just yesterday, Lindsey

31:36.061 --> 31:39.131
Graham earlier this week.

31:39.131 --> 31:42.300
How do they change the shape of
the race, what they're talking
about?

31:42.300 --> 31:45.470
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Lindsey
Graham is a foreign policy
candidate primarily, though

31:45.470 --> 31:48.073
he has been a very effective
legislator. He is the kind of
guy who can work across lines

31:48.073 --> 31:51.343
and can craft coalitions.

31:51.343 --> 31:55.814
And so it seems to make him a
bit of a niche candidate to
raise the foreign policy issue

31:55.814 --> 31:59.985
and maybe shape the debate. But
it's hard to see him rising to
the first tier. Rick

31:59.985 --> 32:03.522
Perry by resume should be in the
first tier, but he ran such a
bad race last time. I

32:03.522 --> 32:06.591
was going through my head trying
to think of somebody who ran
really a bad race and

32:06.591 --> 32:10.428
then suddenly emerged as
a superstar next time.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.965
Candidates tend to get better.
They don't get that much better.
So, I have to remain

32:13.965 --> 32:19.171
as a skeptic. The one person
who is sort of rising in the
buzz sphere is Carly Fiorina,

32:19.171 --> 32:23.008
the former business executive
who has never been elected
really. But she's
outperforming.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.610
She's getting good crowds. And
so if there's any buzz on the
Republican side right now,

32:25.610 --> 32:27.846
it's sort of with
her at the moment.

32:27.846 --> 32:32.717
MARK SHIELDS: I'm a Lindsey
Graham fan. And I think Lindsey
Graham comes with real

32:32.717 --> 32:38.256
credentials and real
credibility, ISIS, foreign
policy, national security. This
is somebody

32:38.256 --> 32:43.128
who is long and deep in the --
on this area. He's
knowledgeable.

32:43.128 --> 32:48.934
You can disagree with his
policies. And I do in many
cases. But he's a real player.

32:48.934 --> 32:54.639
As far as people wanting
bipartisanship, this is someone
who voted for both Elena Kagan

32:54.639 --> 33:01.947
and Sonia Sotomayor to confirm
them. He vs in immigration
reform. He has stood constant

33:01.947 --> 33:05.083
for a path to citizenship and a
path to legal status for
undocumented immigrants.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.219
JUDY WOODRUFF: On
climate change.

33:07.219 --> 33:12.090
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. And, no, I
just -- I think he's a grownup.
John McCain calls

33:12.090 --> 33:16.828
him his illegitimate son because
they're so close on national
security. But I think

33:16.828 --> 33:22.801
Lindsey Graham, in this climate
of concern about ISIS, is a real
factor.

33:22.801 --> 33:28.340
Rick Perry, if he'd done this
year what he did -- had done
four years ago in preparation

33:28.340 --> 33:33.345
and studying and all the rest of
it, he's a natural politician.
He's a very gifted

33:33.345 --> 33:37.549
one-on-one politician. And he
has got a real story to tell. I
mean, the Texas -- whatever

33:37.549 --> 33:41.186
you say about Texas, and wages
not being good or treatment of
workers not being great, there

33:41.186 --> 33:44.589
are millions of jobs. It's
created more jobs than anyplace
in the country.

33:44.589 --> 33:48.426
So, do you get a second chance
to make a first impression?
That's his dilemma.

33:48.426 --> 33:52.497
JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to ask
you both quickly about what
Lindsey Graham -- you both

33:52.497 --> 33:57.669
have made the point he's making
foreign policy, national
security the main thrust of the
campaign.

33:57.669 --> 34:02.607
David, it raises the question,
do the Republicans have a better
idea, does anybody have a better

34:02.607 --> 34:05.510
idea what to do right now about
the Middle East, about ISIS?

34:05.510 --> 34:08.446
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well,
nobody has a great solution.

34:08.446 --> 34:11.583
But I think Lindsey Graham has
some solutions. And some of the
Republicans have some others

34:11.583 --> 34:16.521
which personally I think are
better than what's Obama is
offering, first to give the
Sunni

34:16.521 --> 34:20.425
tribes some arms directly. The
central government in Baghdad
has not given them anything.
And

34:20.425 --> 34:24.262
so ISIS is pretty much free to
take over. And sending a bunch
of Iranian-backed Shia

34:24.262 --> 34:26.765
militia into the Sunni Triangle
is not actually a great idea.
And that's we, perversely,

34:26.765 --> 34:28.867
are doing.

34:28.867 --> 34:32.437
So, that's one improvement I
think that could be made.
Second, there are reports of
ISIS

34:32.437 --> 34:37.509
convoys are just wandering
unmolested across the
battlefield, and so maybe
stepping up

34:37.509 --> 34:41.146
some of the attacks. And then
not putting American troops on
the front line. Nobody

34:41.146 --> 34:44.249
wants to do that, but putting
more trainers in there, a little
more infrastructure in

34:44.249 --> 34:46.785
there would probably be helpful.

34:46.785 --> 34:51.122
I'm not sure these are great
solutions, but I think the big
solution is, let's try -- let's

34:51.122 --> 34:54.526
not pretend that Sunni or Shia
are going to govern together any
time soon. Let's try

34:54.526 --> 34:59.230
to federalize the system. And
so that's something that --
these are in contrast to

34:59.230 --> 35:02.734
what's been happening in the
last six and even the last 12
years. And a lot of Republicans

35:02.734 --> 35:04.269
are at least standing for -- at
least they have got an
alternative. It's a plausible

35:04.269 --> 35:05.537
alternative.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.272
JUDY WOODRUFF: It would be a
big change, Mark, wouldn't it?

35:07.272 --> 35:10.775
MARK SHIELDS: I'm
not sure, Judy.

35:10.775 --> 35:16.314
I'm not sure the country is
ready for a change. I'm not
sure that there is a certain
trumpet

35:16.314 --> 35:22.354
or even an uncertain trumpet
being sounded by anybody in the
race at this point. I

35:22.354 --> 35:30.729
think there's a limit on
Americans' expectations of what
we can achieve and a
disappointment

35:30.729 --> 35:36.901
and a sense of disenchantment
and a sense almost of tragedy of
what has happened.

35:36.901 --> 35:43.441
At the same time, I don't see
the plan, that we're going to
send troops in when -- how

35:43.441 --> 35:48.313
do we know when they have
succeeded? How do we know when
they come out? And, you

35:48.313 --> 35:56.755
know, I think arming Sunnis at
this point, given the tension
and the reality in Syria

35:56.755 --> 36:01.593
and in Iraq, is maybe helping
ISIS, quite bluntly.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.929
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we reported
earlier in the show that the
U.S. is finally sending

36:04.929 --> 36:09.134
weapons now to help the Iraqi
army, something that I guess
they were -- the prime minister

36:09.134 --> 36:10.869
had been complaining about.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.470
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.874
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
you both about something we have
watched all this week, and

36:15.874 --> 36:20.779
that is the vice
president and his loss.

36:20.779 --> 36:26.785
We have just seen this striking
outpouring, David, of sympathy
for Joe Biden and the loss

36:26.785 --> 36:35.193
of his son Beau Biden. The
funeral is tomorrow. What is it
about this family and about the

36:35.193 --> 36:39.264
really extraordinary personal
losses that the vice president
has experienced?

36:39.264 --> 36:42.901
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, there
are some people in Washington
that people just like

36:42.901 --> 36:46.438
on the strength of their
character and on the strength of
their warm heart.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.207
Lindsey Graham -- I agree with
Mark -- Lindsey Graham is one,
but Joe Biden is certainly

36:49.207 --> 36:52.911
another. You could agree or
disagree, but the man has an
extraordinary, glowing heart.

36:52.911 --> 36:57.682
He's a wonderful guy, a decent
human being and a man of
genuineness.

36:57.682 --> 37:01.486
And I only met Beau Biden a few
times, but he struck me as
having some of the same
qualities.

37:01.486 --> 37:06.424
He was a public servant, not a
media hound at all. But when you
met him in off-the-record

37:06.424 --> 37:11.329
setting, he was very warm, and
glowing, and had a big handsome
smile. And so people

37:11.329 --> 37:17.135
just sense, through all the maze
of politics, just genuineness
and a large heart. And

37:17.135 --> 37:21.106
that's what both Bidens,
father and son, have and had.

37:21.106 --> 37:24.542
MARK SHIELDS: I agree
with David, Judy.

37:24.542 --> 37:31.349
I would just add this, that no
parent ever wants to bury a
child. And now, in Joe Biden's

37:31.349 --> 37:38.189
case, some 46 years apart, he's
buried his second child, himself
a father and a husband

37:38.189 --> 37:39.824
and with two children.

37:39.824 --> 37:42.293
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lost
his first wife.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.962
MARK SHIELDS: Lost his first
wife and his daughter in a
tragic accident when he was

37:43.962 --> 37:46.030
29 years old.

37:46.030 --> 37:53.705
And Joe Biden is a model for
every male who is a father or
aspires to be a father, widowed

37:53.705 --> 37:59.878
at the age of 29. He drove two
hours each way back and forth to
work to be home with

37:59.878 --> 38:04.382
his kids at night. And, as he
put it recently at Yale: I did
it because I needed my kids

38:04.382 --> 38:06.784
more than they needed me.

38:06.784 --> 38:12.323
And I would just add one little
P.S. And that is, every year at
Christmas, Joe Biden,

38:12.323 --> 38:16.694
who road Amtrak back and forth
to Wilmington, threw a Christmas
party for the workers who

38:16.694 --> 38:23.168
worked on the train, the
engineers, the conductors, the
people there.

38:23.168 --> 38:27.238
I mean, it just further
example of what David

38:27.238 --> 38:32.744
said. He is a man of a warm
heart, an open heart, generous
heart. And I think the
outpouring,

38:32.744 --> 38:36.481
especially on the president --
the president has been more
unguarded in his own feelings,

38:36.481 --> 38:39.017
I think, about -- toward
Beau Biden and to Joe.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.385
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he will be
speaking tomorrow at the
services.

38:40.385 --> 38:41.519
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.989
JUDY WOODRUFF: We thank you
both, Mark Shields, David
Brooks.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.793
And we will be back with a look
at critical elections in Turkey.

38:48.793 --> 38:53.464
But, first, it's pledge week on
PBS. This break allows your
public television station

38:53.464 --> 38:56.935
to ask for your support. And
that support helps keep programs
like ours on the air.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.704
(BREAK)

38:59.704 --> 39:14.152
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Turkey, at
least two people are dead after
a pair of explosions ripped

39:14.152 --> 39:16.821
through a Kurdish political
rally. It happened in the
mainly Kurdish city of
Diyarbakir.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.724
More than 100 people are
reported injured. An opposition
leader is calling it an attack

39:19.724 --> 39:22.527
against his party and
not an accident.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.630
The incidents come just two days
before Turkey's election, when
millions are expected to endorse

39:25.630 --> 39:30.101
or stop a power play attempt by
the country's controversial
leader.

39:30.101 --> 39:35.406
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret Warner,
explains.

39:35.406 --> 39:44.282
MARGARET WARNER: By law, he's
not supposed to be campaigning,
and his name isn't even

39:44.282 --> 39:50.521
on the ballot, but Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan looks
and sounds a lot like a
candidate.

39:50.521 --> 39:53.324
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
Prime Minister (through
translator): God willing, the
conquest

39:53.324 --> 39:56.995
will be on election day.

39:56.995 --> 40:01.165
MARGARET WARNER: Turkey heads
to parliamentary elections on
Sunday, to choose among an
alphabet

40:01.165 --> 40:07.272
soup of parties. Erdogan wants
his own A.K. Party to win at
least 60 percent of the seats,

40:07.272 --> 40:11.743
so it can move to change the
constitution and grant
executive-style powers to the
presidency.

40:11.743 --> 40:17.949
But the energy of the new but
the energy of the new HDP
threatens that plan. A
pro-Kurdish

40:17.949 --> 40:24.055
party that's now reaching out to
women, gays and labor, it needs
10 percent of the vote

40:24.055 --> 40:28.092
to gain entry into parliament.
That would make it hard for the
AKP to win the 330 seats

40:28.092 --> 40:29.861
it seeks.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.064
SELAHATTIN DEMIRTAS, Leader, HDP
(through translator): People
think that we're the

40:33.064 --> 40:39.304
only ones who can block
Erdogan's stance of unlimited
power and what he calls a
presidency,

40:39.304 --> 40:42.674
but what we call dictatorship.

40:42.674 --> 40:46.744
MARGARET WARNER: The leading
traditional opposition group,
the Republican People's

40:46.744 --> 40:50.114
Party, or CHP, also charges
Erdogan is threatening the
country's democratic foundation.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.717
KEMAL KILICDAROGLU, Leader, CHP:
(through translator): The
importance of these elections

40:52.717 --> 40:56.587
is democracy. Turkey will
either move toward authoritarian
rule or will opt for democracy.

40:56.587 --> 41:03.261
MARGARET WARNER: Indeed,
Erdogan is already accused of
trying to muzzle dissent, using

41:03.261 --> 41:06.631
intimidation of media outlets
and speeches lashing out at
journalists.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.367
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN (through
translator): They are paid
charlatans. They cannot

41:09.367 --> 41:13.471
endure the fact that you
have a right to speak.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.909
MARGARET WARNER: There's also
widespread criticism of his
costly building spree, including

41:17.909 --> 41:24.849
a 1,000-room palace complex in
Ankara, while Turkey's economy
is lagging, from 7 percent

41:24.849 --> 41:26.684
growth a decade ago to 3
percent expected this year.

41:26.684 --> 41:29.487
Also on voters' minds, the
civil war in neighboring

41:29.487 --> 41:33.458
Syria that's sent nearly two
million refugees into Turkey.
The Erdogan government wants

41:33.458 --> 41:38.730
Syria's President Bashar
al-Assad removed, but is at odds
with the U.S. about how to

41:38.730 --> 41:42.867
make that happen. So far, the
Turks have refused to let U.S.
fighter jets use Incirlik

41:42.867 --> 41:47.305
Air Base to bomb Islamic State
targets in Iraq and Syria.

41:47.305 --> 41:51.175
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
Margaret joins me now.

41:51.175 --> 41:56.714
So, Margaret, these attacks at
the Kurdish rally today, what
does it say about any connection

41:56.714 --> 41:58.049
to these elections coming up?

41:58.049 --> 42:00.818
MARGARET WARNER: I think it
shows, Judy, is how high
tensions are running right now,

42:00.818 --> 42:05.223
not only over the election, but
within Turkish society and
politics.

42:05.223 --> 42:12.530
And so this is an election at
which you don't have at stake
the classic issues of war and

42:12.530 --> 42:16.968
peace or the economy. It's
really about Erdogan's wanting
to fulfill this lifelong

42:16.968 --> 42:20.037
dream of becoming another Kemal
Ataturk, the all-powerful
Turkish president who founded

42:20.037 --> 42:22.974
modern Turkey almost
100 years ago.

42:22.974 --> 42:27.745
And the new quirk is that is
what is standing in his way is
this pro-Turkish -- pro-Kurdish

42:27.745 --> 42:32.049
party. And so, though it's not
clear even that today's attack
was deliberate, though

42:32.049 --> 42:35.653
it looks suspiciously so, or who
was behind it, there are plenty
of players with motives,

42:35.653 --> 42:39.123
everyone from operatives from
Erdogan's party who want to sort
of to Turks, don't want for

42:39.123 --> 42:41.592
a pro-Kurdish party, because
they're going to respond with
violence, or in fact Kurdish

42:41.592 --> 42:44.262
militants, who don't want a
pro-Kurdish party in parliament.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.763
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a lot of
tension everywhere you look.

42:45.763 --> 42:47.632
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

42:47.632 --> 42:55.706
JUDY WOODRUFF: What role is
Erdogan himself playing in
stirring all this up?

42:55.706 --> 43:01.412
MARGARET WARNER: Oh, a huge
role, Judy. It's not only in
stirring it up, but that

43:01.412 --> 43:09.487
he's become the focus of it.

43:09.487 --> 43:24.735
Now, you remember, when he was
elected in 2002, he came from a
party with Islamist roots. And
so, first of all,

43:24.735 --> 43:31.642
the secular Turks were very
worried that he was going to
completely Islamicize Turkish

43:31.642 --> 43:40.151
society. And he did move to
change education and the system
and so forth.

43:40.151 --> 43:43.688
But the business community found
he was incredibly helpful to
them. He jump-started the
Turkish

43:43.688 --> 43:47.892
economy. They had growth rates
of 9, 10 percent last time I was
there. So, everybody

43:47.892 --> 43:51.295
kind of came to live with him.

43:51.295 --> 44:01.806
But then, the last three or four
years -- and he won a lot of
elections by very big margins

44:01.806 --> 44:09.213
-- the last three or four years,
his autocratic tendencies are
really coming to fore. He

44:09.213 --> 44:15.520
silences dissent, whether it's
protesters in Gezi Park, whether
it's journalists, whether

44:15.520 --> 44:20.925
it's opposition figures. He
even fires prosecutors
investigating his own
government.

44:20.925 --> 44:31.202
And so what you have now is, of
course he still has a huge base
of rural, conservative,

44:31.202 --> 44:42.914
Islamic support. And nobody
thinks he won't win most votes
or his party won't win most.

44:42.914 --> 44:53.224
But enough voters are telling
pollsters that they are worried
that, if he gets the

44:53.224 --> 45:01.999
kind of huge margin he wants to
ram through this constitutional
change, then he will become

45:01.999 --> 45:05.436
very much like Russia's Vladimir
Putin, in other words, an
elected, but authoritarian

45:05.436 --> 45:07.371
ruler.

45:07.371 --> 45:12.743
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally, I
know you have been talking to
people in Washington. What

45:12.743 --> 45:16.847
are they saying, officials here
saying about how this -- how the
U.S. sees all this?

45:16.847 --> 45:19.116
MARGARET WARNER: Well,
three things, Judy.

45:19.116 --> 45:23.955
First of all, they are very
concerned by a lot of the
rhetoric and polarizing rhetoric

45:23.955 --> 45:28.893
of this campaign, including from
Erdogan himself, a lot of
anti-U.S., anti-Israel, there's
an

45:28.893 --> 45:32.396
international conspiracy
against me. OK.

45:32.396 --> 45:40.638
Two, however, they don't think
it is going to really affect the
cooperation or a lack

45:40.638 --> 45:48.913
of cooperation on the
all-important issue of how to
approach Syria and Iraq. Those

45:48.913 --> 45:55.152
differences are more
deep-seated than that.

45:55.152 --> 46:08.532
What does worry some U.S.
officials is the prospect of a
destabilized Turkey in any way.

46:08.532 --> 46:19.410
In other words, there are
scenarios -- for instance, if
the pro-Kurdish party wins by

46:19.410 --> 46:43.768
just a razor-thin margin, and
there is suspicions of fraud,
that could bring out protests
and

46:43.768 --> 46:47.972
so on.

46:47.972 --> 47:00.351
And the U.S. still needs Turkey
as a strong, stable ally on
issues, everything from a
missile

47:00.351 --> 47:05.322
shield to negotiations with
Iran. So they don't need a
distracted Turkish government.

47:05.322 --> 47:12.930
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I know you
are going to be watching the
elections on Sunday. We're

47:12.930 --> 47:53.904
going to have you back Monday to
talk about what it all -- what
came out of it.

47:53.904 --> 47:58.843
Margaret Warner, we thank you.

47:58.843 --> 48:01.979
MARGARET WARNER: As always.

48:01.979 --> 48:17.228
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
our "NewsHour" Shares of the
day, something that caught our

48:17.228 --> 48:39.183
eye which might be of
interest to you, too.

48:39.183 --> 49:03.040
Today is the 30th anniversary of
perhaps the most famous day off
in history. It's when

49:03.040 --> 49:23.093
Ferris Bueller played hooky in
the classic John Hughes feature
film. We know that thanks

49:23.093 --> 49:37.975
to some careful digging by the
Web site Baseball Prospectus in
2011. It discovered Ferris

49:37.975 --> 49:57.695
and his pals saw the Chicago
Cubs play the Atlanta Braves at
Wrigley Field on June 5,

49:57.695 --> 50:00.130
1985.

50:00.130 --> 50:12.610
On the "NewsHour" online: A
list of the 50 best restaurants
in the world was released

50:12.610 --> 50:28.659
this week. But before you go
make your reservations, take a
quick tour of the top 10 and see
how

50:28.659 --> 51:37.761
much a typical tasting menu will
cost you. We have those prices,
plus a photo gallery,

51:37.761 --> 53:01.078
on our home page. Yes,
that's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:01.078 --> 53:19.997
And

53:19.997 --> 53:31.942
a

53:31.942 --> 53:35.512
reminder about some upcoming
programs from our PBS
colleagues.

53:35.512 --> 53:38.015
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening. Here's a

53:38.015 --> 53:39.883
preview.

53:39.883 --> 53:44.655
GWEN IFILL: Who's watching
whom? Who's protecting whom?
And what role does our

53:44.655 --> 53:50.794
government play? The Supreme
Court finds room to agree or why
you can't yell fire in

53:50.794 --> 53:56.767
a crowded theater. And foreign
new candidates bring the 2016
total to 14, with more to come.

53:56.767 --> 54:00.604
We explore later tonight on
"Washington Week" -- Judy.

54:00.604 --> 54:05.275
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" Saturday: Are drug
companies paying to keep

54:05.275 --> 54:10.681
lower-cost generic drugs off the
market? We update the story.

54:10.681 --> 54:12.783
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:12.783 --> 54:13.784
Have a great weekend.
Thank you, and good night.
