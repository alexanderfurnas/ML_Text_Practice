CLOSER THAN EVER TO MAKING A

00:32.766 --> 00:33.867
DROUGHT HAS FARMERS DESPERATE

00:33.867 --> 00:35.502
FOR WATER.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.970
>> Reporter: MARY MORTGAGED HER

00:36.970 --> 00:39.473
HOME, PLUNKED DOWN ALMOST

00:39.473 --> 00:41.174
$200,000 TO DRILL A WELL.

00:41.174 --> 00:41.842
IT SAVED HER FARM.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.776
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:42.776 --> 00:44.344
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.113
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:46.113 --> 00:47.614
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:47.614 --> 00:51.618
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:51.618 --> 00:52.252
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:52.252 --> 00:52.653
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.054
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.389
WE BEGIN IN GREECE, WHERE THE

00:55.389 --> 00:57.090
RESULTS OF A NATIONWIDE VOTE

00:57.090 --> 01:01.028
TOMORROW COULD KEEP THE DEBT-

01:01.028 --> 01:01.728
RIDDEN ECONOMY AFLOAT OR CUT OFF

01:01.728 --> 01:02.596
DESPERATELY-NEEDED FINANCIAL

01:02.596 --> 01:03.297
SUPPORT FROM ITS EUROPEAN

01:03.297 --> 01:04.131
CREDITORS.

01:04.131 --> 01:04.998
VOTERS FROM BOTH CAMPS HAVE BEEN

01:04.998 --> 01:07.267
HOLDING MASSIVE RALLIES.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.268
IF GREEKS VOTE "NO" TO ADOPTING

01:08.268 --> 01:09.970
A SET OF SEVERE AUSTERITY

01:09.970 --> 01:11.238
MEASURES, THE COUNTRY WOULD LOSE

01:11.238 --> 01:11.672
ANY CHANCE OF GETTING FINANCIAL

01:11.672 --> 01:13.807
HELP.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.475
IF GREEKS VOTE "YES" TO THE

01:15.475 --> 01:16.076
CUTS, THE COUNTRY COULD GET SOME

01:16.076 --> 01:17.711
DEBT RELIEF.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.313
THE REFERENDUM COMES AFTER

01:19.313 --> 01:21.114
GREECE FAILED TO PAY A 1.6

01:21.114 --> 01:22.883
BILLION EURO DEBT PAYMENT,

01:22.883 --> 01:23.750
SHUTTERED ITS BANKS AND STARTED

01:23.750 --> 01:25.485
RATIONING CASH.

01:25.485 --> 01:26.720
TODAY, GREECE'S FINANCE MINISTER

01:26.720 --> 01:28.388
ACCUSED CREDITORS OF TRYING TO"

01:28.388 --> 01:30.424
TERRORIZE" CITIZENS BY

01:30.424 --> 01:31.458
"INSTILLING FEAR IN PEOPLE" SO

01:31.458 --> 01:32.292
THEY'LL APPROVE THE TOUGH

01:32.292 --> 01:33.560
AUSTERITY MEASURES.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.928
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH NEWSHOUR

01:34.928 --> 01:36.296
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT MALCOLM

01:36.296 --> 01:37.731
BRABANT ABOUT THE MOOD OF THE

01:37.731 --> 01:38.765
PEOPLE ON THE EVE OF THIS

01:38.765 --> 01:39.833
HISTORIC VOTE.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.000
YOU'VE BEEN

01:40.000 --> 01:41.768
REPORTING ON THIS FOR THE PAST

01:41.768 --> 01:43.036
SEVERAL WEEKS FOR US AND OTHER

01:43.036 --> 01:43.203
PLACES.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.672
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ON

01:45.672 --> 01:46.506
THE STREET.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.076
THE POLLS SAY THAT THIS VOTE IS

01:49.076 --> 01:49.576
INCREDIBLY CLOSE.

01:49.576 --> 01:50.844
WHAT IS THE FEELING THAT YOU GET

01:50.844 --> 01:52.512
ON THE STREET?

01:52.512 --> 01:54.147
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH

01:54.147 --> 01:55.515
WAY THIS VOTE IS GOING TO GO

01:55.515 --> 01:57.517
BECAUSE IT'S A HUGELY DIFFICULT

01:57.517 --> 01:58.852
AND COMPLEX VOTE FOR PEOPLE TO

01:58.852 --> 01:59.052
MAKE.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.522
THE QUESTION ON THE BALLOT PAPER

02:02.522 --> 02:04.524
IS, SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY

02:04.524 --> 02:05.525
BAFFLE ECONOMIC STUDENTS.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.095
FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE IT'S A VERY

02:08.095 --> 02:10.197
DIFFICULT CHOICE.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.665
BASICALLY IT DISTILLS DOWN TO

02:11.665 --> 02:13.333
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO VOTE

02:13.333 --> 02:16.303
MORE OF THE SAME OR INCREASED OS

02:16.303 --> 02:18.271
STATE WHICH MAY BE MORE SEVERE

02:18.271 --> 02:19.539
THAT IS THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.975
OR SOMETHING THAT IS A STEP INTO

02:21.975 --> 02:23.343
THE UNKNOWN BECAUSE NOBODY

02:23.343 --> 02:23.977
REALLY KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO

02:23.977 --> 02:27.014
HAPPEN IF THE COUNTRY VOTES NO.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.281
THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS BASICALLY

02:28.281 --> 02:30.217
SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:30.217 --> 02:31.852
HAVE A BETTER TERMS POSSIBLY

02:31.852 --> 02:33.987
WITH THE CREDITORS.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.323
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:36.323 --> 02:38.025
REALLY S UNDECIDED.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.327
SO THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT

02:40.327 --> 02:42.796
QUESTION IN GREECE'S MODERN

02:42.796 --> 02:42.963
HISTORY.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.231
>> Sreenivasan: IT'S BEEN A

02:44.231 --> 02:45.866
WEEK SINCE THE BANKS HAVE BEEN

02:45.866 --> 02:47.401
CLOSED, MONEY HAS BEEN RATIONED.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.203
ARE THE IMPACTS THAT YOU SEE...

02:50.203 --> 02:52.305
ARE THERE SHORTAGES OF GOODS IN

02:52.305 --> 02:53.573
STORES NOW DUE TO IMPORT

02:53.573 --> 02:54.241
RESTRICTIONS?

02:54.241 --> 02:55.075
>> NO.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.643
WE'RE NOT SEEING SHORTAGES YET

02:56.643 --> 02:57.577
BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

02:57.577 --> 02:58.845
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE

02:58.845 --> 02:59.613
FUTURE.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.416
THERE ARE CONCERNS, PEOPLE JUST

03:02.416 --> 03:03.417
WON'T GET THE GOODS THAT THEY

03:03.417 --> 03:03.817
WANT TO.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.719
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY

03:05.719 --> 03:06.319
NOW WANTS CASH.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.956
BECAUSE CASH IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.

03:09.956 --> 03:13.493
AND SO SUPPLIERS AREN'T GIVING

03:13.493 --> 03:14.861
MATERIALS TO SHOPS WITHOUT

03:14.861 --> 03:15.996
GETTING CASH.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.799
CUSTOMERS RELUCTANT TO PART WITH

03:18.799 --> 03:19.032
THEIR CASH.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.834
THE LIQUIDITY IS SHRINK CAN THAT

03:20.834 --> 03:22.035
MAKES THE DIFFICULT FOR THE

03:22.035 --> 03:24.704
SOCIETY TO SURVIVE.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.440
THE IRONIC THING WHAT THE

03:26.440 --> 03:27.007
CREDITORS WANTED TO HAVE IS A

03:27.007 --> 03:31.411
SORT OF A MODERN SOCIETY,

03:31.411 --> 03:32.512
FINANCIAL SOCIETY WITH CREDIT

03:32.512 --> 03:34.714
AND WITH MONEY SORT OF GOING

03:34.714 --> 03:36.349
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS

03:36.349 --> 03:36.616
ELECTRONICALLY.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.118
WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS IN THAT

03:38.118 --> 03:38.285
RESPECT.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.153
GOING BACK TO THE 1908s.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.022
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

03:42.022 --> 03:42.989
POSSIBILITIES ON MONDAY IN

03:42.989 --> 03:45.525
EITHER WAY THAT THE VOTE TURNS

03:45.525 --> 03:47.394
OUT, DO THE CENTRAL BANKERS WHEN

03:47.394 --> 03:49.629
THEY MEET COULD THEY APPROVE

03:49.629 --> 03:51.698
BAIL-OUT FUNDING IF THE YES SIDE

03:51.698 --> 03:53.166
WINS OR COULD THEY SAY, YOU'RE

03:53.166 --> 03:54.935
OUT OF THE EURO ZONE IF THE NO

03:54.935 --> 03:56.203
SIDE WINS?

03:56.203 --> 03:56.870
>> I DON'T THINK SO IT'S GOING

03:56.870 --> 03:58.271
TO HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.408
THAT THIS HAS BEEN A MUCH SLOWER

04:01.408 --> 04:03.276
SLIDE THAN PEOPLE HAD IMAGINED.

04:03.276 --> 04:04.377
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT

04:04.377 --> 04:06.680
AFTER THE DEFAULT THAT THERE

04:06.680 --> 04:08.415
WOULD HAVE BEEN ARMAGEDDON THAT

04:08.415 --> 04:09.182
HASN'T HAPPENED.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.150
THE STRIKE DOWNWARDS HAS BEEN

04:10.150 --> 04:11.985
FAIRLY GENTLE.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.787
BUILT THE PROBLEM IS, THAT THE

04:13.787 --> 04:15.122
MONEY IS RUNNING OUT OF THE

04:15.122 --> 04:16.256
BANKS HERE AND THE BIG QUESTION

04:16.256 --> 04:17.924
IS, IF THERE IS A NO VOTE WILT

04:17.924 --> 04:21.528
THE BANKS ACTUALLY DRY OUT

04:21.528 --> 04:23.130
BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL

04:23.130 --> 04:25.732
BANK MAY FEEL COMPELLED NOT TO

04:25.732 --> 04:26.199
GIVE THE BANKS HERE ANY MORE

04:26.199 --> 04:26.933
MONEY AT ALL.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.735
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT

04:28.735 --> 04:29.903
THE SOCIAL TENSION REGARDLESS OF

04:29.903 --> 04:32.272
WHICH WAY THE VOTE GOES?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.508
>> IT IS REALLY SORT OF QUITE

04:34.508 --> 04:36.676
INTENSE BECAUSE THE COUNTRY S

04:36.676 --> 04:37.477
COMPLETELY DIVIDED.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.411
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS

04:38.411 --> 04:41.181
BEING THE LEVELS OF HATRED THAT

04:41.181 --> 04:42.282
MIGHT EXIST AFTER THIS SOMETHING

04:42.282 --> 04:45.519
THAT DEEPLY THAT HAPPENED DURING

04:45.519 --> 04:47.387
THE CIVIL WAR WHICH STARTED 70

04:47.387 --> 04:47.888
YEARS AGO.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.024
THAT IS A COUNTRY WHICH ALWAYS

04:51.024 --> 04:53.927
HAD THIS TENDENCY TO TURN ON

04:53.927 --> 04:56.530
ITSELF AND SELF DESTRUCTED PAST.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.532
PEOPLE HERE HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT

04:58.532 --> 04:59.699
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.602
AND AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDED IN

05:02.602 --> 05:04.604
1950, IT TOOK ABOUT 30 YEARS FOR

05:04.604 --> 05:06.907
THE COUNTRY TO BE ALMOST UNIFIED

05:06.907 --> 05:09.309
SO THOSE ARE THE KIND 6 TENSION,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.144
IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.245
REALLY IMMENSE.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.213
ALTHOUGH IF YOU WERE TO LOOK

05:13.213 --> 05:13.980
AROUND THE CITY TONIGHT WOULD

05:13.980 --> 05:15.482
YOU SAY THAT IT WAS RELAXED.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.449
BUT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF

05:16.449 --> 05:17.851
TENSION UPPED THE SURFACE.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.553
>> Sreenivasan: MALCOLM

05:19.553 --> 05:21.087
BRABANT JOINING US FROM ATHENS,

05:21.087 --> 05:21.321
GREECE.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.456
THANKS SO MUCH.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.558
>> Sreenivasan: IN VIENNA,

05:24.558 --> 05:25.525
NEGOTIATORS ARE RACING TO MEET A

05:25.525 --> 05:27.260
JULY 7 DEADLINE FOR A DEAL ON

05:27.260 --> 05:28.695
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.363
LATE LAST NIGHT, IRAN'S FOREIGN

05:30.363 --> 05:31.765
MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT TEHRAN

05:31.765 --> 05:33.667
WAS READY TO STRIKE A DEAL AND

05:33.667 --> 05:35.268
THAT NEGOTIATORS HAD "NEVER BEEN

05:35.268 --> 05:36.937
CLOSER TO A LASTING OUTCOME."

05:36.937 --> 05:38.104
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

05:38.104 --> 05:39.372
KERRY AGREES THEY'RE MAKING

05:39.372 --> 05:40.707
PROGRESS BUT SAYS THERE'S STILL

05:40.707 --> 05:42.442
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.910
DIPLOMATS FROM THE U.S., U.K.,

05:43.910 --> 05:45.212
FRANCE, CHINA, RUSSIA AND

05:45.212 --> 05:46.980
GERMANY WANT IRAN TO SCALE BACK

05:46.980 --> 05:48.782
ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE

05:48.782 --> 05:50.383
IT CANNOT BUILD A NUCLEAR

05:50.383 --> 05:50.984
WEAPON.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.786
BUT IRAN WANTS LEADERS TO LIFT

05:52.786 --> 05:54.621
CRIPPLING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS

05:54.621 --> 05:55.822
BEFORE IT MAKES ANY CHANGES TO

05:55.822 --> 05:57.057
ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.092
ALLOWING ACCESS TO U.N. WEAPONS

05:59.092 --> 06:00.293
INSPECTORS HAS ALSO BECOME A

06:00.293 --> 06:01.628
MAJOR STICKING POINT.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.896
BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTER INDIRA

06:02.896 --> 06:04.231
LAKSHMANAN HAS BEEN COVERING THE

06:04.231 --> 06:05.799
STORY, AND SHE JOINS ME NOW FROM

06:05.799 --> 06:06.733
VIENNA.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.167
THEY SAY "CLOSE" IS ONLY GOOD

06:07.167 --> 06:08.501
IN HORSESHOES AND HAND GRENADES.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.070
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO REACHING A

06:10.070 --> 06:13.039
DEAL HERE?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.741
>> WELL, YES, THAT'S EXACTLY

06:14.741 --> 06:14.908
RIGHT.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.844
I MEAN YOU CAN BE CLOSE BUT NO

06:17.844 --> 06:19.713
CIGAR AS THE OLD SAY CAN GOES.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
THE AMERICAN DELEGATION HAS BEEN

06:21.615 --> 06:22.282
CLEAR TELLING THAWS WHILE THEY

06:22.282 --> 06:23.717
ARE CLOSER THAN THEY EVER HAVE

06:23.717 --> 06:25.685
BEEN BEFORE THAT THIS STILL

06:25.685 --> 06:28.922
COULD GO UP IN FLAMES IF SOME

06:28.922 --> 06:30.190
VERY IMPORTANT POLITICAL

06:30.190 --> 06:30.624
DECISIONS NOT TAKEN.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.925
OF COURSE WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT

06:31.925 --> 06:33.393
IS THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE TO

06:33.393 --> 06:36.196
MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT GIVING

06:36.196 --> 06:38.231
ACCESS AND SPECIFICALLY ACCESS

06:38.231 --> 06:40.333
FOR THE IAEA WHICH MEANS THE

06:40.333 --> 06:43.570
U.N. MONITORS TO INSPECT AND

06:43.570 --> 06:47.240
MEET WITH PEOPLE AND SCIENTIST

06:47.240 --> 06:49.442
LOOK AT SITES THERE ARE PAST

06:49.442 --> 06:49.843
MURK WORK.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.679
THAT IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY THE

06:52.679 --> 06:53.446
DETAINING NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT

06:53.446 --> 06:55.015
FOR THIS DEAL TO COME TOGETHER

06:55.015 --> 06:55.548
IN THE COMING DAYS.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.083
>> Sreenivasan: THERE WAS

06:57.083 --> 06:58.885
PROGRESS EARLIER THEY ANNOUNCED

06:58.885 --> 06:59.886
BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY

06:59.886 --> 07:01.655
WOULD HAVE A REPORT ON THIS,

07:01.655 --> 07:02.656
THAT IS SEEMED LIKE A STEP IN

07:02.656 --> 07:03.556
THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT IRAN

07:03.556 --> 07:05.492
COULD UNDERSTAND THAT, THE U.N.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.660
COULD LIKE IT, THE U.S. COULD,

07:06.660 --> 07:09.729
TOO.

07:09.729 --> 07:10.397
>> YEAH.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.098
THAT ACTUALLY JUST HAPPENED

07:12.098 --> 07:14.668
TODAY, HARI, I WAS HUGE NEWS

07:14.668 --> 07:18.138
THAT IS IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL

07:18.138 --> 07:20.240
JUST CAME BACK FROM TAKE RAN, HE

07:20.240 --> 07:21.975
CAME BEFORE REPORTERS TODAY SAID

07:21.975 --> 07:24.044
THAT IF TAKE RAN COOPERATES THAT

07:24.044 --> 07:26.346
THEY FEEL THAT THE U.N. COULD

07:26.346 --> 07:28.415
PUT TOGETHER ITS REPORT, TO

07:28.415 --> 07:31.251
DIRECT THE EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE

07:31.251 --> 07:32.052
MILITARY DIRECTIONS IN THE PAST

07:32.052 --> 07:32.919
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

07:32.919 --> 07:33.920
BUT THE KEY PART THAT HAVE

07:33.920 --> 07:35.422
SENTENCE IS, IF TAKE RAN

07:35.422 --> 07:36.990
COOPERATES.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.158
SO, WHAT OUR SOURCES TELL US

07:38.158 --> 07:40.126
THAT RIGHT NOW THE TWO SIDES ARE

07:40.126 --> 07:41.027
WORKING ON A LIFT.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.462
THEY'RE WORKING ON PUTTING

07:42.462 --> 07:44.364
TOGETHER A LIST BASED ON U.S.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.366
INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER WESTERN

07:46.366 --> 07:47.567
INTELLIGENCE, ISRAELI

07:47.567 --> 07:48.435
INTELLIGENCE, FIGURING OUT WHO

07:48.435 --> 07:50.270
ARE THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE AND THE

07:50.270 --> 07:51.071
IMPORTANT SITES TRYING TO MAKE

07:51.071 --> 07:53.006
SURE THAT IRAN AGREES THAT THOSE

07:53.006 --> 07:54.774
SITES CAN BE INVESTIGATED, THOSE

07:54.774 --> 07:56.009
PEOPLE CAN BE INTERVIEWED.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.744
WITH THESE SORT OF WHAT IS NOPE

07:57.744 --> 08:00.146
AS ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL PLUS,

08:00.146 --> 08:00.914
PLUS MORE ACCESS.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.182
THAT IS REALLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO

08:02.182 --> 08:03.383
GET TO THE BOTTOM.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.485
WE HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED THAT

08:05.485 --> 08:07.454
BUT SANCTIONS IS THE OTHER

08:07.454 --> 08:09.489
CRITICAL PIECE, TO GIVE THIS

08:09.489 --> 08:10.824
ACCESS THEY WANT CANGSS RELEASED

08:10.824 --> 08:12.092
ON THE OTHER END THAT IS THE

08:12.092 --> 08:13.293
OTHER STICKING POINT

08:13.293 --> 08:14.561
PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF TIME

08:14.561 --> 08:15.829
SCHEDULE HOW THAT IS GOING TO

08:15.829 --> 08:17.030
WORK THAT THEY STILL NEED TO

08:17.030 --> 08:18.798
WORK OUT WE'RE GOING TO BE

08:18.798 --> 08:19.999
WAITING FOR FOREIGN MINISTERS TO

08:19.999 --> 08:21.468
COME TOGETHER TOMORROW IN THE

08:21.468 --> 08:23.336
BUILDING RIGHT BEHIND ME, THE

08:23.336 --> 08:24.170
PALACE WHERE THESE NEGOTIATIONS

08:24.170 --> 08:26.106
ARE TAKING PLACE TO MAKE A FINAL

08:26.106 --> 08:26.306
DECISION.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.140
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

08:27.140 --> 08:28.808
TIMING, THIS IS WHAT MAKES

08:28.808 --> 08:30.009
NEGOTIATIONS STICKY, BOTH SIDES

08:30.009 --> 08:31.644
WANT THE OTHER SIDE TO DO THEIR

08:31.644 --> 08:35.448
PART FIRST.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.716
>> RIGHT.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.851
WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE

08:37.851 --> 08:39.552
LAST FEW DAYS THERE HAS BEEN

08:39.552 --> 08:41.321
THIS CRITICAL AGREEMENT THAT

08:41.321 --> 08:44.457
THERE IS GOING TO BE

08:44.457 --> 08:44.791
SIMULTANEOUSNESS, WHILE THE

08:44.791 --> 08:46.326
UNITED STATES AND EU PREPARING

08:46.326 --> 08:47.827
THE LEGAL STEPS, THE REGULATORY

08:47.827 --> 08:49.729
STEPS THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE TO

08:49.729 --> 08:51.598
GIVE SANCTIONS RELIEF ON OIL

08:51.598 --> 08:53.166
SANCTIONS, BANKING SANCTIONS,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.968
UNFREEZING ASSETS AND THE REST

08:54.968 --> 08:56.603
FOR ITS PATTY RAP WILL BE TAKING

08:56.603 --> 08:58.972
ALL OF THE STEPS THE OF THAT IT

08:58.972 --> 09:00.507
NEEDS TO PUSH MURK PROGRAM.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.343
SO, THE WORKING IDEA THAT ON THE

09:03.343 --> 09:05.912
DAY THAT THE UNITED NATIONS

09:05.912 --> 09:07.714
VERIFIES YES, IRAN HAS TAKEN

09:07.714 --> 09:09.582
THAT STEPS BY VERY SAME DAY THE

09:09.582 --> 09:10.650
SANCTIONS WILL BE LIFTED.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.385
IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPLICATED

09:12.385 --> 09:12.619
THING.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.920
I THINK SOMETHING WE COULD SEE

09:13.920 --> 09:14.821
PERHAPS BY THE END OF THE YEAR

09:14.821 --> 09:16.890
BUT AMERICANS HAVE TOLD ME THEY

09:16.890 --> 09:18.591
THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY EARLY

09:18.591 --> 09:20.360
NEXT YEAR, THIS REALLY DEPENDS

09:20.360 --> 09:21.861
OUT QUICKLY IRAN IS WILLING TO

09:21.861 --> 09:22.362
TAKE THOSE STEPS.

09:22.362 --> 09:26.533
THAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO CURB

09:26.533 --> 09:26.733
NUCLEAR ACTIVITY.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.234
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

09:28.234 --> 09:29.936
SOURCES THAT YOU'VE TONE THAT

09:29.936 --> 09:30.904
ABOUT CHANCES OF THIS GETTING

09:30.904 --> 09:34.274
THROUGH CONGRESS.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.809
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IF IT WAS HARD

09:35.809 --> 09:38.511
TO SEAL THIS DEAL HERE IN VIENNA

09:38.511 --> 09:40.146
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD TO

09:40.146 --> 09:42.182
SEAL THIS DEAL ON CAPITOL HILL

09:42.182 --> 09:44.784
TO SELL IT TO ALL OF THE

09:44.784 --> 09:45.985
CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE PREDISPOSED

09:45.985 --> 09:46.486
AGAINST IT.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.388
THE FACT IS, IT'S NOT PRESENTIVE

09:48.388 --> 09:49.522
OF WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

09:49.522 --> 09:51.424
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING

09:51.424 --> 09:53.293
MOST IS VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF

09:53.293 --> 09:55.662
THE NUCLEAR DEAL ON CAPITAL HILL

09:55.662 --> 09:57.931
THERE IS LOT OF SUSPENSION ABOUT

09:57.931 --> 09:58.131
THIS.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.433
ALSO AMONGST THINK TANKS AND

10:00.433 --> 10:01.768
PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS, PEOPLE ARE

10:01.768 --> 10:02.802
CONCERNED THINK THAT IRAN CANNOT

10:02.802 --> 10:06.506
BE TRUSTED IN ANY NUCLEAR DEAL

10:06.506 --> 10:08.475
PART IS BECAUSE NET NET HAS

10:08.475 --> 10:10.076
RAISED A LOT OF HIS EXPERIENCE.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.412
WE'RE GOING TO, IF THIS DEAL

10:12.412 --> 10:14.314
HAPPEN IS GOING TO HAVE 30 DAY

10:14.314 --> 10:15.548
PERIOD WHICH CONGRESS CAN REVIEW

10:15.548 --> 10:18.318
IT CAN EITHER SAY YEAH OR NAY

10:18.318 --> 10:21.421
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE 30

10:21.421 --> 10:23.490
INCREDIBLY TAN DEN SHIES DAYS TO

10:23.490 --> 10:24.958
BE WALKING.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.160
>> JOINING FROM OF FROES VIENNA,

DELANO'S MAIN STREET.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.165
>> WELL, I KNOW WE NEED RAIN.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.266
WE CAN'T MAKE IT RAIN OURSELVES,

14:27.266 --> 14:27.700
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY GIVE IT TO

14:27.700 --> 14:29.202
GOD.

14:29.202 --> 14:33.172
IT'S ALL YOU CAN DO RIGHT ABOUT

14:34.474 --> 14:35.408
DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW

14:35.408 --> 14:36.576
MUCH THE DROUGHT IS CHANGING THE

14:36.576 --> 14:37.944
VALLEY, LISTEN TO MATT AS HE

14:37.944 --> 14:38.778
DRIVES OUT WITH THE EVENING

14:38.778 --> 14:40.313
FEED.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.914
>> I FIRST CAME HERE ABOUT FIVE

14:41.914 --> 14:43.282
YEARS AGO, AND THE GRASS WAS AT

14:43.282 --> 14:45.151
LEAST SHOULDER HEIGHT.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.586
EVERY YEAR THAT WE'VE HAD A

14:46.586 --> 14:47.887
DROUGHT, THE FIELDS REMAIN BALD,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.922
JUST PURE DIRT.

14:49.922 --> 14:50.957
WE USED TO HAVE DANDELIONS OUT

14:50.957 --> 14:51.591
IN THE FIELD THAT WERE TALLER

14:51.591 --> 14:53.292
THAN ME.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.328
THAT, YOU CAN FEED A HERD OF

14:55.328 --> 14:57.196
COWS WITH; THIS, YOU CAN'T.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.765
>> Reporter: THE HERD USED TO

14:58.765 --> 15:00.199
NUMBER 200, BUT WHEN THE DROUGHT

15:00.199 --> 15:03.236
HIT, PASTURES BEGAN DYING.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.270
THE RANCH OWNER BEGAN BUYING HAY

15:04.270 --> 15:05.872
TO FEED THE HERD.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.240
AS THE DROUGHT CONTINUED, THE

15:07.240 --> 15:09.108
OWNER WAS FORCED TO BEGIN

15:09.108 --> 15:10.042
SELLING OFF THE HERD YOU SEE UP

15:10.042 --> 15:12.078
AHEAD.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.447
COW BY COW, THE HERD DWINDLED TO

15:14.447 --> 15:16.549
A 100 AND THEN TO LESS THAN 50.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.484
HE ALSO SOLD HIS ONLY BULL, AND

15:18.484 --> 15:19.118
WITH IT MUCH OF THE HERD'S

15:19.118 --> 15:21.087
FUTURE.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.755
BUT THE BIGGER STORY, THE REASON

15:22.755 --> 15:24.390
WE'VE COME TO DELANO IS WHAT'S

15:24.390 --> 15:26.225
HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE RANCH.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.027
THE CALIFORNIA DROUGHT IS

15:28.027 --> 15:29.862
ENTERING ITS FOURTH STRAIGHT

15:29.862 --> 15:31.063
YEAR, A DROUGHT SOME FEAR COULD

15:31.063 --> 15:32.999
BECOME THE MOST COSTLY IN THE

15:32.999 --> 15:34.801
HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN WEST.

15:34.801 --> 15:35.501
>> YOU GOT GOOD YEARS AND BAD

15:35.501 --> 15:37.770
YEARS.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.905
THIS IS WHAT I CALL WORST YEARS.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.107
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.441
>> Reporter: MATT'S BOSS, RANCH

15:42.441 --> 15:44.143
OWNER JESSE REVILLA, SAYS

15:44.143 --> 15:46.112
DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS, THE

15:46.112 --> 15:47.613
REMAINING HERD IS LOSING WEIGHT,

15:47.613 --> 15:48.648
BUT FEEDING THEM IS BREAKING

15:48.648 --> 15:49.582
HIM.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.118
HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP THAT UP?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.119
>> WELL, THAT MEANS I GOT TO GO

15:53.119 --> 15:54.987
SELL SOME MORE COWS.

15:54.987 --> 15:55.955
I GOT TO SELL MORE CATTLE SO I

15:55.955 --> 15:57.924
CAN BUY MORE HAY.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.592
>> Reporter: SO THE HERD KEEPS

15:59.592 --> 16:00.092
GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER?

16:00.092 --> 16:01.194

POORER.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.035

16:09.035 --> 16:10.937
LAST YEAR, THE HOTTEST EVER

16:10.937 --> 16:12.805
RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA, WATER

16:12.805 --> 16:14.440
LEVELS FELL SO LOW THAT

16:14.440 --> 16:16.576
AUTHORITIES CUT OFF WATER TO

16:16.576 --> 16:17.910
MOST FARMERS, MEANING FARMERS

16:17.910 --> 16:19.278
HAD TO USE WELL WATER OR LOSE

16:19.278 --> 16:20.813
EVERYTHING.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.814
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A WELL, WHAT

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO YOUR

16:22.648 --> 16:23.182
TREES?

16:23.182 --> 16:23.950

16:23.950 --> 16:25.051
BY NOW.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.953

16:28.688 --> 16:30.156
HUNDREDS OF FARMERS NOW DRILLING

16:30.156 --> 16:32.291
FOR WATER.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.993
MARY GROWS 84 ACRES OF ALMONDS.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.161

16:35.161 --> 16:37.964
WATER TO STAY ALIVE.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.166
SIX MONTHS BEFORE HER WATER

16:40.166 --> 16:42.835
ALLOTMENT WAS CUT OFF, MARY

16:42.835 --> 16:45.571
MORTGAGED HER HOME, PLUNKED DOWN

16:45.571 --> 16:47.907
ALMOST $200,000 TO DRILL A WELL.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.141
IT SAVED HER FARM.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.276
HOW HARD WAS THAT DECISION?

16:50.276 --> 16:52.411
>> IT WASN'T HARD BECAUSE WE HAD

16:52.411 --> 16:54.013
ALREADY INVESTED SO MUCH.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.715
WE CAN'T STOP NOW.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.983
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

16:56.983 --> 16:58.417
HAPPEN NEXT YEAR OR THE OTHER,

16:58.417 --> 16:59.518
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING

16:59.518 --> 17:03.055
FORWARD BECAUSE WE GOT

17:03.055 --> 17:03.856
EVERYTHING, OUR WHOLE LIFE

17:03.856 --> 17:05.992
INVESTED IN THIS 84 ACRES.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.593
>> Reporter: WHICH IS WHY

17:07.593 --> 17:09.362
FARMERS LIKE MARY WHO CAN AFFORD

17:09.362 --> 17:10.196
IT ARE DRILLING MORE WELLS THAN

17:10.196 --> 17:12.231
EVER.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.432
DRILLING CREWS ARE ARRIVING FROM

17:13.432 --> 17:14.901

17:17.003 --> 17:19.872
THE DEMAND.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.607
IF WE WANT DRILL A WELL IN OUR

17:21.607 --> 17:23.276

17:23.276 --> 17:24.543

17:24.543 --> 17:24.977
MONTHS TO A YEAR AND A HALF

17:24.977 --> 17:26.345
BEHIND.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.114
>> Reporter: BUT MORE WORRISOME

17:28.114 --> 17:29.982
IS THAT SO MUCH WATER IS BEING

17:29.982 --> 17:32.451
PUMPED FROM UNDERGROUND TO

17:32.451 --> 17:34.887
REPLACE WATER LOST IN THIS

17:34.887 --> 17:35.988
DROUGHT THAT FEW PEOPLE BELIEVE

17:35.988 --> 17:38.057
IT CAN BE SUSTAINED.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.425
WELLS ARE GOING DRY, AND

17:39.425 --> 17:39.926
DRILLERS ARE FORCED TO GO DEEPER

17:39.926 --> 17:42.728

1,600 FEET, 350 FEET DEEPER THAN

17:50.369 --> 17:51.203
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IS

17:51.203 --> 17:53.005
HIGH.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.007
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU FEEL LIKE

17:55.007 --> 17:57.743
WE CAN ONLY PUNCH SO MANY HOLES

17:57.743 --> 17:58.911
AND PULL OUT SO MUCH WATER

17:58.911 --> 17:59.245
BEFORE WE REALLY START SEEING

17:59.245 --> 18:02.381
HUGE PROBLEMS?

18:02.381 --> 18:03.749
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE'RE TO THAT

18:03.749 --> 18:05.718
STAGE RIGHT NOW, I THINK,

18:05.718 --> 18:07.053
BECAUSE THE DEEPER YOU GO ON

18:07.053 --> 18:08.287
SOME OF THIS, YOU'RE LOSING OUT

18:08.287 --> 18:09.455
ON WATER QUALITY, TOO.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.556
YOU'RE GOING TO GET DOWN SO DEEP

18:10.556 --> 18:11.424
AND THE WATER'S GOING TO START

18:11.424 --> 18:12.959
GETTING SALTY ON YOU.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.061

18:15.061 --> 18:16.996
WATER ON IN A YEAR.

18:16.996 --> 18:17.596

18:20.566 --> 18:22.368
COULD NOT AFFORD TO DRILL WELLS

18:22.368 --> 18:23.369
HELPLESSLY WATCHED THEIR

18:25.938 --> 18:28.274
THESE ORANGE TREES ARE DEAD, AND

18:28.274 --> 18:29.508
THERE ARE THOUSANDS JUST LIKE

18:29.508 --> 18:30.676
THEM NOT FAR FROM DELANO'S MAIN

18:30.676 --> 18:31.844

18:31.844 --> 18:33.079

18:33.079 --> 18:34.747
IN A LOT OF CASES, THE FARMERS

18:34.747 --> 18:37.783
HAVE THEIR HEART AND SOUL IN

18:37.783 --> 18:39.151
THIS LAND, AND IT'S LIKE LOSING

18:39.151 --> 18:41.520
A PART OF YOUR FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.655
AND ECONOMICALLY, IT'S

18:42.655 --> 18:44.657
DISASTROUS.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.525
>> Reporter: IN CALIFORNIA,

18:46.525 --> 18:48.961
WATER IS CONSIDERED A PROPERTY

18:48.961 --> 18:50.363
RIGHT, SO FARMERS ARE FREE TO

18:50.363 --> 18:51.364
DRILL AS MUCH AS THEY WANT; ALL

18:51.364 --> 18:55.735
THEY NEED IS A PERMIT.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.169
BUT NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH WATER

18:57.169 --> 19:00.272
FARMERS ARE PULLING FROM THE

19:00.272 --> 19:01.807
UNDERGROUND AQUIFER-- THAT'S THE

19:03.476 --> 19:05.811
OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS FROM

19:07.113 --> 19:10.249
HOW MUCH WATER IS LEFT.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.118
IF AN AQUIFER IS LIKE A SAVINGS

19:12.118 --> 19:15.388
ACCOUNT, THIS IS A RUN ON THE

THE GOVERNOR, JERRY BROWN,

19:25.398 --> 19:26.165
CALIFORNIA VOTERS LAST YEAR

19:26.165 --> 19:27.133
AGREED THEY HAD TO BE BETTER

19:27.133 --> 19:28.234
PREPARED FOR A DROUGHT, SO THEY

19:28.234 --> 19:29.568
PASSED A $7.5 BILLION BOND FOR

19:29.568 --> 19:30.603
BUILDING WATER STORAGE

FACILITIES AND WATER RECYCLING

19:31.871 --> 19:33.239
PROJECTS.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.174
BUT THE EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE

19:35.174 --> 19:36.375
WATER SUPPLY ALSO MEANS BIG CUTS

19:36.375 --> 19:39.078
IN CONSUMPTION.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.546
IN APRIL, GOVERNOR BROWN IMPOSED

19:40.546 --> 19:42.648
NEW RESTRICTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA

19:49.155 --> 19:51.223
FOR 80% OF WATER USE IN

19:51.223 --> 19:51.557
CALIFORNIA, WERE SPARED THOSE

19:51.557 --> 19:54.026

20:05.037 --> 20:05.738
TO DREDGE UP MORE WATER FROM THE

20:05.738 --> 20:08.107
GROUND.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.642
THIS ESCALATING THIRST FOR WATER

20:09.642 --> 20:10.743
HAS ALSO LED TO SOME SURPRISING

20:10.743 --> 20:14.046
PARTNERSHIPS.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.582
FOR EXAMPLE, 21 MILLION GALLONS

20:16.582 --> 20:19.051
OF WATER EVERY DAY FLOW INTO THE

20:19.051 --> 20:20.419
CAWELO RESERVOIR, WATER HELPING

20:26.725 --> 20:28.727
THE WATER COMES FROM, OF ALL

20:28.727 --> 20:29.395
PLACES, HERE.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.296
THIS IS CHEVRON'S KERN RIVER OIL

20:30.296 --> 20:31.363

20:31.363 --> 20:33.666
DELANO'S MAIN STREET.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.101
IT'S THE THIRD LARGEST OIL

20:35.101 --> 20:37.069
PRODUCING FIELD IN THE STATE,

20:37.069 --> 20:37.336
MORE THAN 70,000 BARRELS PER

20:37.336 --> 20:40.306
DAY.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.475
BUT IN THE PROCESS OF RETRIEVING

20:42.475 --> 20:44.076
THE OIL, CHEVRON PULLS UP EVEN

20:44.076 --> 20:46.579
MORE WATER, A LOT MORE.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.346
THE WATER IS USED FOR STEAM TO

20:47.346 --> 20:49.715
HELP RECOVER THE OIL

20:49.715 --> 20:52.184
UNDERGROUND, AND THEN SEPARATED

20:52.184 --> 20:53.686

20:53.686 --> 20:55.287
THROUGH PIPELINES TO THE

ONE BARREL OF OIL TO NINE

21:05.097 --> 21:07.466
BARRELS OF WATER.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.101

21:36.395 --> 21:37.396
THE THINGS THEY HOLD DEAR HERE

21:37.396 --> 21:38.564
IN THIS RICH VALLEY ARE SUDDENLY

21:38.564 --> 21:39.465
IN PLAY.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.733
>> IT'S GETTING HARDER AND

21:40.733 --> 21:41.967
HARDER TO BE A RANCHER.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.169
WE NEED THE RAIN.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.870
EVERYONE DOES.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.639
>> IF WE DON'T GET RAIN THIS

21:46.639 --> 21:48.274
YEAR, WE'RE IN FOR SOME REALLY

21:48.274 --> 21:49.975
BAD TIMES.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.243
>> I GUESS WE'RE STILL HERE

21:51.243 --> 21:52.511
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR LIFE AND

21:52.511 --> 21:53.546
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO

21:53.546 --> 21:54.980
KEEP FARMING AS LONG AS WE

21:54.980 --> 21:56.081
POSSIBLY CAN.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.352
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DATE WAS

22:00.352 --> 22:02.054
AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE ACTUALLY

22:02.054 --> 22:03.122
DECLARED?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.290
FOR EIGHT THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT

22:04.290 --> 22:05.591
KNOW ABOUT THE FOURTH OF JULY,

22:05.591 --> 22:08.360
VISIT www.pbs.org/newshour.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.969
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:16.969 --> 22:18.337
SATURDAY.

22:24.476 --> 22:25.211
>> Sreenivasan: AND ON THIS

22:25.211 --> 22:26.679
INDEPENDENCE DAY, A SHIP THAT

22:26.679 --> 22:27.513
CHANGED THE COURSE OF THE

22:27.513 --> 22:31.717
AMERICAN REVOLUTION SAILS AGAIN.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.118
A REPLICA OF THE FRENCH SHIP

22:33.118 --> 22:34.587
"THE HERMIONE," ALSO KNOWN AS

22:34.587 --> 22:36.088
THE FREEDOM FRIGATE, CRUISED

22:36.088 --> 22:37.423
INTO NEW YORK THIS WEEK.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.757
IN THE HEAT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY

22:38.757 --> 22:41.060
WAR, BEFORE DIPLOMATIC CABLES OR

22:41.060 --> 22:43.529
EMAILS, FRANCE USED THIS SHIP TO

22:43.529 --> 22:44.630
SEND A MESSAGE TO GEORGE

22:44.630 --> 22:46.732
WASHINGTON THAT HELP WAS ON THE

22:46.732 --> 22:47.566
WAY.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.867
THE MESSENGER WAS MARQUIS DE

22:48.867 --> 22:50.002
LAFAYETTE.

22:50.002 --> 22:50.836
>> THE WORD THAT LAFAYETTE IS

22:50.836 --> 22:52.238
BRINGING WITH HIM AS THAT

22:52.238 --> 22:54.673
AMBASSADOR BASICALLY IS THAT AN

22:54.673 --> 22:56.075
ARMY WILL BE ARRIVING, AN

22:56.075 --> 22:57.810
EXPEDITION OF 5,000 SOLDIERS

22:57.810 --> 22:59.812
AND, CRITICALLY, A NAVY, AS

22:59.812 --> 23:00.946
WELL.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.281
SO, SHIPS OF THE LINE.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.882
AMERICA HAD A NAVY-- AND STATE

23:03.882 --> 23:06.118
NAVIES, AT THAT-- BUT NONE OF

23:06.118 --> 23:08.254
OUR SHIPS WERE SIZABLE ENOUGH TO

23:08.254 --> 23:09.288
TAKE ON BRITAIN.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.089
>> Sreenivasan: ADAM HODGES-

23:10.089 --> 23:11.657
LECLAIR IS RE-ENACTING THE ROLE

23:11.657 --> 23:13.158
OF MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE, THE

23:13.158 --> 23:14.927
FAMED FRENCHMAN WHO LOBBIED KING

23:14.927 --> 23:17.463
LOUIS XVI TO SUPPORT AMERICA IN

23:17.463 --> 23:19.398
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.866
FRANCE PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED

23:20.866 --> 23:22.301
NAVAL POWER TO HELP TURN THE

23:22.301 --> 23:24.803
TIDE IN DEFEATING THE BRITISH.

23:24.803 --> 23:25.771
IT WAS THE FRENCH NAVY THAT

23:25.771 --> 23:26.805
HELPED ENSURE THE BRITISH

23:26.805 --> 23:28.440
SURRENDER AT YORKTOWN.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.575
>> WE DECLARED OUR INDEPENDENCE

23:29.575 --> 23:32.144
IN 1776, BUT FOUR YEARS LATER

23:32.144 --> 23:35.047
THE WAR WAS REALLY UNCERTAIN.

23:35.047 --> 23:35.948
THE FRENCH HAD COME AND

23:35.948 --> 23:37.182
SUPPORTED US, AND THEY WERE

23:37.182 --> 23:39.585
GIVING ARMS AND EQUIPMENT, BUT

23:39.585 --> 23:41.120
NAVAL SUPPORT WAS CRITICAL.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.388
SO, A SHIP LIKE THIS ARRIVING

23:42.388 --> 23:44.023
WITH A FLEET COMING AFTER IT

23:44.023 --> 23:45.124
CARRYING LAFAYETTE-- AGAIN,

23:45.124 --> 23:46.292
SYMBOLICALLY BRINGING THAT

23:46.292 --> 23:47.826
MESSAGE OF SUPPORT-- WAS A REAL

23:47.826 --> 23:48.894
GAME CHANGER.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.396
>> Sreenivasan: THIS $21 MILLION

23:50.396 --> 23:52.331
SHIP, WHICH SET SAIL FROM FRANCE

23:52.331 --> 23:53.966
IN APRIL, WILL MAKE A DOZEN

23:53.966 --> 23:55.701
STOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.803
AT EACH CITY, SIGHTSEERS CAN SEE

23:57.803 --> 23:59.805
THE SHIP'S 32 CANNONS, HEMP

23:59.805 --> 24:02.141
ROPES COATED IN TAR AND SHIP'S

24:02.141 --> 24:04.176
BELL, AND INTERACT WITH A CREW

24:04.176 --> 24:06.478
DRESSED IN PERIOD COSTUMES-- ALL

24:06.478 --> 24:08.247
TO FIND OUT WHAT SEAFARING LIFE

24:08.247 --> 24:10.482
IN THE 18th CENTURY WAS LIKE.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.117
THE "HERMIONE" LEFT NEW YORK

24:12.117 --> 24:13.218
THIS MORNING.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.320
ON ITS WAY OUT, IT PASSED BY

24:14.320 --> 24:15.821
ANOTHER FRENCH CONTRIBUTION TO

24:15.821 --> 24:18.791
THE U.S., THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.631
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY

24:25.631 --> 24:26.932
TONIGHT ISIS HAS REPORTEDLY

24:26.932 --> 24:28.467
RELEASED A VIDEO SHOWING

24:28.467 --> 24:31.203
TEENAGERS EXECUTING 25 SYRIAN

24:31.203 --> 24:32.871
GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF

24:32.871 --> 24:34.340
A CROWD AT AN ANCIENT

24:34.340 --> 24:36.308
AMPHITHEATER IN PALMERA AFTER

24:36.308 --> 24:38.010
THE CITY WAS CAPTURED IN MAY.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.745
TUNISIA HAS DECLARED A STATE OF

24:39.745 --> 24:40.979
EMERGENCY MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER

24:40.979 --> 24:43.582
A GUNMAN KILLED 38 TOURISTS.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.217
AUTHORITIES WERE CRITICIZED FOR

24:45.217 --> 24:46.785
NOT RESPONDING MORE QUICKLY.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.220
NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS TIGHTENED

24:48.220 --> 24:50.122
SECURITY, DEPLOYED 1400 ARMED

24:50.122 --> 24:51.724
OFFICERS TO PATROL HOTELS AND

24:51.724 --> 24:53.258
BEACHES, AND PROMISED TO CLOSE

24:53.258 --> 24:55.361
SOME 80 MOSQUES SUSPECTED OF

24:55.361 --> 24:57.029
SPREADING EXTREMISM.

24:57.029 --> 24:57.863
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.964
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.065
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
