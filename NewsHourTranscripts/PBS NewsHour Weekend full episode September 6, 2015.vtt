03:48.800 --> 03:50.633
TO HOLD TALKS WITH HER COALITION

03:50.633 --> 03:52.267
PARTNERS ON A CRISIS THAT HAS

03:52.267 --> 03:56.433
DIVIDED THE EU, THE EUROPEAN

03:56.433 --> 03:57.967
COMMISSION SHE HAS BEEN PUSH FOG

03:57.967 --> 03:59.233
ARCO AT THAT SYSTEM FOR DIVIDING

03:59.233 --> 04:01.000
THE PEOPLE REACHING EUROPE

BETWEEN MEMBER STATES.

04:02.200 --> 04:08.167
BUT THIS IS GOING TO -- .. IN

04:08.167 --> 04:10.200
THE MEANTIME, THOUSANDS MORE ARE

CONTINUING TO MAKE THE JOURNEY,

04:13.967 --> 04:16.333
RISKING LIFE AND LIMB IN SEARCH

04:16.333 --> 04:20.233
OF A BETTER LIFE.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.000
>>

04:21.000 --> 04:21.767
>> Stewart: THE BIGGEST CATALYST

04:21.767 --> 04:22.800
FOR THE MASS MIGRATION TO EUROPE

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
IS SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR, WHICH IS

04:23.800 --> 04:24.833
BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED 250,000

04:24.833 --> 04:26.000
PEOPLE AND DRIVEN AN ESTIMATED

04:26.000 --> 04:26.700
11 MILLION SYRIANS FROM THEIR

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
HOMES.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.133
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

04:29.133 --> 04:31.100
WARNED RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER

04:31.100 --> 04:32.967
THIS WEEKEND ABOUT REPORTS OF

04:32.967 --> 04:34.833
RUSSIA INCREASING SPECIFIC TYPES

04:34.833 --> 04:36.867
OF SUPPORT FOR SYRIAN PRESIDENT

04:36.867 --> 04:38.933
BASHAR AL-ASSAD'S REGIME.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.700
KERRY SAYS THE INCREASED SUPPORT

04:40.700 --> 04:42.100
COULD ESCALATE THE CONFLICT AND

04:42.100 --> 04:44.167
THE REFUGEE CRISIS.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.433
JOINING ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON

04:45.433 --> 04:47.300
TO DISCUSS THE WAR IN SYRIA IS

04:47.300 --> 04:48.567
ANTHONY CORDESMAN, WHO IS THE

04:48.567 --> 04:50.000
ARLEIGH A. BURKE CHAIR IN

04:50.000 --> 04:51.367
STRATEGY AT THE CENTER FOR

04:51.367 --> 04:52.667
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

04:52.667 --> 04:56.567
STUDIES.

04:56.567 --> 04:57.533
>> Stewart: SO SECRETARY OF

04:57.533 --> 04:59.100
STATE KERRY'S CONCERNS, AT THIS

04:59.100 --> 05:00.600
POINT IN THE CONFLICT, WHAT

05:00.600 --> 05:03.567
WOULD A RUSSIAN INFUSION OF

05:03.567 --> 05:06.900
SUPPORT FOR ASSAD'S ARMY AND

05:06.900 --> 05:08.200
REGIME MEAN?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.500
>> PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THERE IS

05:09.500 --> 05:11.700
EVIDENCE THAT HE MAY BE

05:11.700 --> 05:13.833
PROVIDING OR PUTIN MAY BE

05:13.833 --> 05:15.767
PROVIDING SOMETHING LIKE A

05:15.767 --> 05:18.167
THOUSAND PEOPLE'S WORTH OF

05:18.167 --> 05:19.567
PREFABRICATED HOUSING.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.600
THAT IS, HAS LED SOME ANALYSTS

05:21.600 --> 05:25.533
TO BELIEVE THAT IN RUSSIA MAY BE

05:25.533 --> 05:29.100
DEPLOYING AIR UNITS AND MODERN

05:29.100 --> 05:30.633
AIRCRAFT OR A NEW KIND OF

05:30.633 --> 05:31.467
ADVISORY TEAM.

05:31.467 --> 05:34.967
ANY BUILDUP WILL HELP ASSAD RIDE

05:34.967 --> 05:36.667
OUT OR SURVIVE AT LEAST FOR A

05:36.667 --> 05:39.100
WHILE THE OPPOSITION.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.000
ANY KIND OF ACTIVE AIR PRESENCE

05:42.000 --> 05:44.200
REPRESENTS SYRIA'S PROBLEMS FOR

05:44.200 --> 05:45.700
THE UNITED STATES, FOR TURKEY,

05:45.700 --> 05:47.767
FOR THE OTHER COALITION

05:47.767 --> 05:49.967
COUNTRIES FLYING AIR SORTIES

05:49.967 --> 05:51.167
BECAUSE OF THE RISK THAT THERE

05:51.167 --> 05:53.200
MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF INCIDENT

05:53.200 --> 05:56.433
BETWEEN THE RUSSIANS AND THE AIR

05:56.433 --> 05:58.133
FORCE'S OPERATING AGAINST THE

05:58.133 --> 05:59.467
ISLAMIC STATE.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.167
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, THAT

06:01.167 --> 06:03.433
KIND OF OPERATION WOULD PRESENT

06:03.433 --> 06:06.633
PROBLEMS FOR THE UNITED STATES

06:06.633 --> 06:08.333
BECAUSE OUR ARAB ALLIES,

06:08.333 --> 06:09.033
PARTICULARLY SAUDI ARABIA,

06:09.033 --> 06:11.633
KUWAIT AND THE UNITED ARAB

06:11.633 --> 06:13.167
EMIRATES ARE SUPPORTING SOME OF

06:13.167 --> 06:16.333
THE FORCES ON THE GROUND THAT

06:16.333 --> 06:18.800
ARE OPPOSING ASSAD DIRECTLY.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.900
>> Stewart: THIS CONFLICT

06:19.900 --> 06:22.900
BEGAN IN 2011, IT IS 2015.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.700
AT THIS POINT, WHAT STANDS OUT

06:24.700 --> 06:27.100
TO YOU AS A MAJOR ISSUES KEEPING

06:27.100 --> 06:28.400
US FROM A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION

06:28.400 --> 06:29.200
HERE?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.733
>> I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL

06:30.733 --> 06:33.467
REASONS, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT

06:33.467 --> 06:37.100
ONE IS NO ONE HAS EMERGED AS A

06:37.100 --> 06:38.733
CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.700
SYRIA IS NOW DIVIDED REALLY INTO

06:41.700 --> 06:42.333
FOUR PARTS.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.000
THERE IS A KURDISH AREA, THE

06:45.000 --> 06:46.633
KURDS HAVE NO GREAT INCENTIVE TO

06:46.633 --> 06:48.533
BE A PART OF SYRIA.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.733
THEY WERE TREATED AS

06:49.733 --> 06:51.600
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS BEFORE

06:51.600 --> 06:53.833
THIS BEGAN, AND MANY DIDN'T EVEN

06:53.833 --> 06:56.100
HAVE IDENTIFICATION PAPERS.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.333
YOU HAVE THE ISLAMIC STATE,

06:58.333 --> 07:00.933
WHICH OCCUPIES A SIGNIFICANT

07:00.933 --> 07:02.933
PART OF EASTERN SYRIA,

07:02.933 --> 07:04.667
PARTICULARLY ALONG THE RIVER

07:04.667 --> 07:05.500
AREA.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.233
IT HAS A, IT IS NOT A DENSELY

07:08.233 --> 07:10.400
POPULATED AREA BUT ONE THE

07:10.400 --> 07:11.600
ISLAMIC STATE CAN ACTUALLY

07:11.600 --> 07:12.033
CONTROL.

07:12.033 --> 07:15.567
AND THEN YOU VA MIX OF SOME 26

07:15.567 --> 07:17.000
TO 35 DIFFERENT OPPOSITION

07:17.000 --> 07:19.300
GROUPS WHO ARE DOING MOST OF THE

07:19.300 --> 07:20.700
FIGHTING AGAINST ASSAD.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.967
THEY ARE MORE IN THE CENTRAL

07:22.967 --> 07:25.000
HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS OF

07:25.000 --> 07:26.533
SYRIA, BUT THEY HAVE ALMOST

07:26.533 --> 07:29.267
NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE ASSAD

07:29.267 --> 07:31.100
REGIME, WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE

07:31.100 --> 07:35.700
OR WITH THE KURDS .. THERE ARE

07:35.700 --> 07:37.100
TROOPS OUTSIDE OF SYRIA THAT

07:37.100 --> 07:39.867
CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE

07:39.867 --> 07:40.933
OPPOSITION, THE FACT IS THAT

07:40.933 --> 07:44.600
MANY OF THEM WERE TIED TO MORE

07:44.600 --> 07:47.100
MODERATE, SECULAR MILITARY

07:47.100 --> 07:49.267
MOVEMENTS WHICH HAVE EFFECTIVELY

07:49.267 --> 07:50.500
BEEN DEFEATED AND VIRTUALLY

07:50.500 --> 07:51.200
DISAPPEARED.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.100
>> Stewart: THERE HAS BEEN

07:52.100 --> 07:53.733
QUITE A BIT OF CRITICISM ABOUT

07:53.733 --> 07:55.100
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES NOT

07:55.100 --> 07:57.567
STEPPING IN TO HELP EASE THE

07:57.567 --> 07:59.267
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, SAUDI

07:59.267 --> 08:01.100
ARABIA, QATAR, THE UNITED ARAB

08:01.100 --> 08:02.033
EMIRATES.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.600
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHY

08:03.600 --> 08:05.033
THESE COUNTRIES HAVE NOT STEPPED

08:05.033 --> 08:06.300
IN AND STEPPED UP?

08:06.300 --> 08:09.400
>> ALL OF THEM, FRANKLY, ARE

08:09.400 --> 08:12.000
DEEPLY CONCERNED @WHAT THESE

08:12.000 --> 08:13.833
REFUGEES MIGHT BE AND WHO THEY

08:13.833 --> 08:16.200
MIGHT HAVE ALIGNMENTS WITH.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.567
ALL OF THEM ARE DEALING WITH

08:18.567 --> 08:23.167
THEIR OWN PROBLEMS, IRAN, YEMEN,

08:23.167 --> 08:25.400
ISLAMIC STATE GROUPS, AL QAEDA

08:25.400 --> 08:29.200
IN THE ARABIAN PENS LA, ALL OF

08:29.200 --> 08:32.667
THEM TO BE, TEND TO BE CLOSED

08:32.667 --> 08:33.967
SOCIETIES WHICH SECURITY PUTS

08:33.967 --> 08:35.633
TIGHT LIMITS ON ANY FORM OF

08:35.633 --> 08:36.600
IMMIGRATION.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.333
>> Stewart: ANTHONY CORDESMAN,

08:37.333 --> 08:38.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING US

08:38.700 --> 08:39.700
UNDERSTAND IT A BIT MORE.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.767
>> THANK YOU.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.167
>> Stewart: AS KIDS ACROSS THE

08:50.167 --> 08:51.533
COUNTRY HEAD BACK TO SCHOOL, WE

08:51.533 --> 08:52.867
ARE GOING TO EXAMINE A FIRST-OF-

08:52.867 --> 08:53.700
ITS-KIND PROGRAM MEANT TO BOOST

08:53.700 --> 08:55.633
READING SKILLS.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.433
FLORIDA REQUIRES ITS LOWEST-

08:57.433 --> 08:59.100
PERFORMING SCHOOLS TO LENGTHEN

08:59.100 --> 09:00.367
THEIR SCHOOL DAY FOR ONE HOUR TO

09:00.367 --> 09:02.667
FOCUS ON READING.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.067
THE MANDATE APPLIES TO THE

09:04.067 --> 09:05.267
STATE'S 300 LOWEST-PERFORMING

09:05.267 --> 09:06.233
SCHOOLS, AS RANKED BY THEIR

09:06.233 --> 09:08.067
STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES.

09:08.067 --> 09:11.033
AS YOU'D EXPECT, A LIVELY DEBATE

09:11.033 --> 09:12.800
IS UNDERWAY ABOUT THE WISDOM AND

09:12.800 --> 09:14.733
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLAN.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.233
TONIGHT'S UPDATED SIGNATURE

09:16.233 --> 09:17.900
SEGMENT, WHICH WE ORIGINALLY

09:17.900 --> 09:18.733
BROADCAST LAST YEAR, REVISITS

09:18.733 --> 09:21.567
THIS APPROACH.

09:21.567 --> 09:22.833
JAYLON JENKINS JUST STARTED

09:22.833 --> 09:26.500
THIRD GRADE.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.333
AND EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL, HE

09:27.333 --> 09:29.733
DOES HOMEWORK WITH THE AUNT THAT

09:29.733 --> 09:30.667
IS RAISING HIM, ANTONIA

09:30.667 --> 09:31.167
WILLIAMS.

09:31.167 --> 09:32.067
>> REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT THE

09:32.067 --> 09:32.833
TENSES, FROM RIDE TO...

09:32.833 --> 09:35.033
>> R, O, D, E.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.900
>> I'M NOT A TYRANT.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.033
WHEN HE FIRST COMES HOME I

09:38.033 --> 09:38.967
NORMALLY HAVE... LET HIM HAVE A

09:38.967 --> 09:40.433
20-MINUTE BREAK.

09:40.433 --> 09:41.667
HE GETS A SNACK.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.600
YOU WANT APPLE?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.233
AND THEN WE START HIS HOMEWORK.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.567
I'LL GIVE HIM A BREAK IN BETWEEN

09:46.567 --> 09:47.667
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT TO RETAIN AND

09:47.667 --> 09:48.967
TO COMPREHEND, SO THIS IS OUR...

09:48.967 --> 09:50.633
THIS IS OUR DAILY SCHEDULE.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.067
>> Stewart: A SCHEDULE THAT

09:52.067 --> 09:53.867
ALREADY INCLUDES AN EXTRA HOUR

09:53.867 --> 09:55.667
OF READING EVERY DAY, FOR JAYLON

09:55.667 --> 09:57.533
AND FOR EVERY OTHER STUDENT AT

09:57.533 --> 09:59.133
HIS SCHOOL: PHILLIS WHEATLEY

09:59.133 --> 10:00.900
ELEMENTARY IN APOPKA, FLORIDA,

10:00.900 --> 10:02.100
JUST NORTHWEST OF ORLANDO IN

10:02.100 --> 10:03.700
ORANGE COUNTY.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.433
ANTONIA, WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN

10:05.433 --> 10:06.667
YOU FIRST HEARD THAT JAYLON'S

10:06.667 --> 10:08.033
SCHOOL WAS GOING TO REQUIRE ONE

10:08.033 --> 10:10.900
EXTRA HOUR OF READING?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.033
>> I WAS LIKE, "YES."

10:12.033 --> 10:13.433
>> Stewart: YEAH?

10:13.433 --> 10:15.600
>> I WAS, LIKE, "YES."

10:15.600 --> 10:17.000
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE WOULD A CHILD

10:17.000 --> 10:17.867
BE DOING THAT HOUR AFTER SCHOOL,

10:17.867 --> 10:19.233
YOU KNOW?

10:19.233 --> 10:20.833
YES, IT WOULD BE A LONGER DAY

10:20.833 --> 10:22.267
AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIM

10:22.267 --> 10:23.700
BEING FOCUSED AND STAYING ON

10:23.700 --> 10:25.467
TASK FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.267
BUT HE'S IN A STRUCTURED

10:26.267 --> 10:27.600
ENVIRONMENT.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.800
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE

10:28.800 --> 10:29.500
ON THE PLAYGROUND FOR AN EXTRA

10:29.500 --> 10:30.333
HOUR.

10:30.333 --> 10:30.933
THEY'RE READING.

10:30.933 --> 10:31.667
>> Stewart: HAS HE ASKED YOU WHY

10:31.667 --> 10:32.633
HE STAYS AN EXTRA HOUR?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.533
>> I DON'T EVEN THINK HE

10:33.533 --> 10:35.100
REALIZES IT.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.500
>> Stewart: THE EXTRA HOUR OF

10:36.500 --> 10:37.700
READING AT WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY

10:37.700 --> 10:39.733
IS NOT VOLUNTARY.

10:39.733 --> 10:41.533
A 2012 LAW REQUIRED THE 100

10:41.533 --> 10:43.467
LOWEST-PERFORMING ELEMENTARY

10:43.467 --> 10:44.900
SCHOOLS IN FLORIDA TO ADD AN

10:44.900 --> 10:46.667
HOUR OF READING INSTRUCTION.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.300
THE RANKINGS WERE DETERMINED BY

10:48.300 --> 10:49.600
THE STATE'S STANDARDIZED READING

10:49.600 --> 10:51.200
TEST RESULTS.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.033
THE EXPANSION IS ESTIMATED TO

10:53.033 --> 10:54.933
COST MORE THAN $4 MILLION

10:54.933 --> 10:57.200
ANNUALLY FOR WHEATLEY AND 19

10:57.200 --> 10:59.000
OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN ORANGE

10:59.000 --> 10:59.933
COUNTY, FLORIDA, THE TENTH

10:59.933 --> 11:00.900
LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE

11:00.900 --> 11:02.500
COUNTRY.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.567
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

11:04.567 --> 11:05.600
>> Stewart: WHEN WE VISITED

11:05.600 --> 11:06.967
PHILLIS WHEATLEY LAST YEAR, SEAN

11:06.967 --> 11:07.633
BROWN WAS THE SCHOOL'S

11:07.633 --> 11:09.067
PRINCIPAL.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.000
>> ONCE WE HIT THAT LAST HOUR OF

11:11.000 --> 11:13.033
THE DAY, IT'S STRICTLY READING.

11:13.033 --> 11:14.333
>> Stewart: FROM FOURTH GRADERS

11:14.333 --> 11:15.233
WORKING ON READING COMPREHENSION

11:15.233 --> 11:16.267
QUESTIONS...

11:16.267 --> 11:17.300
>> WE COULD ELIMINATE

11:17.300 --> 11:19.133
UNDERGROUND...

11:19.133 --> 11:20.333
>> Stewart: ...TO FIRST GRADERS

11:20.333 --> 11:23.633
JUST LEARNING THE BASICS...

11:23.633 --> 11:26.267
>> THEY GET DARKER AND DARKER...

11:26.267 --> 11:27.133
>> Stewart: STUDENTS, TAUGHT BY

11:27.133 --> 11:28.767
TEACHERS FROM THE SCHOOL...

11:28.767 --> 11:29.433
>> HARE...

11:29.433 --> 11:31.133
>> HARE...

11:31.133 --> 11:32.033
>> Stewart: READ, READ AND READ

11:32.033 --> 11:34.433
SOME MORE.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.433
>> WE WANT TO HONE IN ON THE

11:36.433 --> 11:37.667
READING SKILLS AND THEN JUST

11:37.667 --> 11:38.600
PUSH THE STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY

11:38.600 --> 11:40.033
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.533
>> Stewart: A HIGH-POVERTY

11:41.533 --> 11:43.067
SCHOOL WHERE ALL STUDENTS GET

11:43.067 --> 11:44.667
FREE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH,

11:44.667 --> 11:46.067
PHILLIS WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY IS

11:46.067 --> 11:47.600
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A HIGH

11:47.600 --> 11:49.100
CRIME RATE AND IS THE TYPE OF

11:49.100 --> 11:50.733
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THINK

11:50.733 --> 11:52.000
COULD PARTICULARLY BENEFIT FROM

11:52.000 --> 11:53.067
THE EXTRA READING TIME.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.100
DO YOU THINK YOUR STUDENTS NEED

11:54.100 --> 11:55.033
THIS EXTRA HOUR?

11:55.033 --> 11:56.133
>> YES, I DO.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.133
>> Stewart: WHY IS THAT?

11:57.133 --> 11:57.933
IS IT... IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE

11:57.933 --> 11:59.100
SO FAR BEHIND?

11:59.100 --> 12:00.333
IS IT JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME

12:00.333 --> 12:01.133
DURING THE DAY TO TEACH THESE

12:01.133 --> 12:02.033
KIDS?

12:02.033 --> 12:03.933
>> THERE'S SEVERAL REASONS.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.033
I KNOW THAT WITH POVERTY AND

12:07.033 --> 12:08.133
ADDING THINGS OF THAT NATURE, I

12:08.133 --> 12:09.033
KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS,

12:09.033 --> 12:10.267
THEY'RE SO MUCH FURTHER BEHIND A

12:10.267 --> 12:11.567
STUDENT THAT HAS TWO PARENTS OR

12:11.567 --> 12:12.333
A STUDENT THAT HAS A HIGH

12:12.333 --> 12:14.633
WORKING-CLASS FAMILY.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.233
SO THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT

12:16.233 --> 12:18.500
WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN

12:18.500 --> 12:20.233
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE LIVING IN

12:20.233 --> 12:21.200
POVERTY AND STUDENTS THAT ARE

12:21.200 --> 12:23.500
NOT LIVING IN POVERTY.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
>> Stewart: AFTER INSTITUTING

12:25.500 --> 12:27.400
THE HOUR OF EXTRA READING EVERY

12:27.400 --> 12:28.767
DAY IN 2012, WHEATLEY SAW THE

12:28.767 --> 12:30.467
NUMBER OF CHILDREN READING A

12:30.467 --> 12:31.867
GRADE LEVEL GO FROM 26 PERCENT

12:31.867 --> 12:34.067
TO 41 PERCENT.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.900
SUCH A BIG IMPROVEMENT THAT

12:35.900 --> 12:39.300
WHEATLEY WAS FREED FROM THE

12:39.300 --> 12:40.567
READING MANDATE THE FOLLOWING

12:40.567 --> 12:48.333
YEAR.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.433
UP TO 38 PERCENT THE FOLLOWING

12:49.433 --> 12:50.133
YEAR.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.167
STATEWIDE, IN THE FIRST YEAR,

12:52.167 --> 12:53.967
76 PERCENT OF SCHOOLS WITH EXTRA

12:53.967 --> 12:55.567
READING TIME SAW AN IMPROVEMENT

12:55.567 --> 12:58.433
IN KIDS READING AT GRADE LEVEL.

12:58.433 --> 12:59.967
69 PERCENT OF THE LOW PERFORMING

12:59.967 --> 13:01.267
SCHOOLS ALSO SAW IT INCREASE IN

13:01.267 --> 13:02.100
THE SECOND YEAR.

13:02.100 --> 13:02.500
>> THE

13:02.500 --> 13:04.233
>> THE RESULTS HAVE TURNED OUT

13:04.233 --> 13:05.400
TO BE DRAMATIC.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.767
>> Stewart: REPUBLICAN STATE

13:06.767 --> 13:08.033
SENATOR DAVID SIMMONS IS THE

13:08.033 --> 13:08.867
FORCE BEHIND THE STATE LAW

13:08.867 --> 13:10.500
ADDING THE EXTRA HOUR.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.367
THE SON OF TWO PUBLIC SCHOOL

13:12.367 --> 13:14.067
TEACHERS, HE SAYS HE FIRST HEARD

13:14.067 --> 13:15.367
ABOUT ADDING EXTRA TIME FROM A

13:15.367 --> 13:16.333
PRINCIPAL AT A STRUGGLING

13:16.333 --> 13:18.500
ORLANDO SCHOOL.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.967
>> AND IN TALKING TO HIM, HE

13:19.967 --> 13:21.500
SAID, "IF I JUST HAD MORE TIME

13:21.500 --> 13:23.700
WITH THESE CHILDREN, I COULD

13:23.700 --> 13:26.500
MAKE A BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE WITH

13:26.500 --> 13:27.800
THEM."

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
AND HE SAID, "IT'S NOT THAT THEY

13:28.800 --> 13:29.600
CAN'T LEARN.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.533
IT'S THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME

13:30.533 --> 13:31.433
TO LEARN."

13:31.433 --> 13:32.700
>> Stewart: LAST YEAR SENATOR

13:32.700 --> 13:33.967
SIMMONS PUSHED TO EXPAND THE

13:33.967 --> 13:35.433
NUMBER OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

13:35.433 --> 13:37.033
REQUIRED TO HAVE EXTRA READING

13:37.033 --> 13:39.067
TIME FROM THE 100 LOWEST-

13:39.067 --> 13:40.500
PERFORMING TO THE 300 LOWEST-

13:40.500 --> 13:41.433
PERFORMING, INCLUDING PHILLIS

13:41.433 --> 13:42.967
WHEATLEY.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.033
BY EXPANDING THE LIST, SIMMONS

13:45.033 --> 13:46.533
BELIEVES SCHOOLS THAT IMPROVE

13:46.533 --> 13:47.700
THEIR TEST SCORES ONE YEAR WON'T

13:47.700 --> 13:48.767
LOSE THE EXTRA READING TIME THE

13:48.767 --> 13:50.867
NEXT.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.967
THIS YEAR THE SAME 300 SCHOOLS

13:52.967 --> 13:54.100
WILL PROVIDE THAT EXTRA HOUR OF

13:54.100 --> 13:55.333
READING TIME.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.733
WHEN YOU FIRST PRESENTED THE

13:56.733 --> 13:58.167
IDEA OF THIS ADDITIONAL HOUR OF

13:58.167 --> 13:59.233
READING TO YOUR COLLEAGUES, WHAT

13:59.233 --> 14:00.267
KIND OF QUESTIONS DID THEY HAVE

14:00.267 --> 14:01.600
FOR YOU?

14:01.600 --> 14:02.900
>> IS IT GONNA WORK?

14:02.900 --> 14:03.833
>> Stewart: MAKE THE CASE FOR

14:03.833 --> 14:04.333
ME.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.167
>> OKAY.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.700
CERTAINLY.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.900
OTHER NATIONS, INDUSTRIALIZED

14:09.900 --> 14:13.200
NATIONS, SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO

14:13.200 --> 14:14.500
SCHOOL, ALL OF THEIR CHILDREN,

14:14.500 --> 14:15.633
SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN WE DO

14:15.633 --> 14:16.533
HERE ON AVERAGE IN THE UNITED

14:16.533 --> 14:18.500
STATES.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.200
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO

14:21.200 --> 14:23.333
CRAM A HUGE AMOUNT OF

14:23.333 --> 14:24.833
INFORMATION INTO THE MINDS OF

14:24.833 --> 14:25.700
THESE CHILDREN IN A LIMITED

14:25.700 --> 14:28.233
AMOUNT OF TIME.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.533
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PUT 25

14:29.533 --> 14:30.567
POUNDS OF SUGAR IN A 10 POUND

14:30.567 --> 14:32.500
SACK.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.033
>> SENATOR SIMMONS IS LOOKING AT

14:34.033 --> 14:36.300
A PIECE OF FOOL'S GOLD, AND HE

14:36.300 --> 14:38.333
BELIEVES IT'S REAL GENUINE GOLD.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.633
>> Stewart: RICK ROACH SERVED ON

14:39.633 --> 14:40.800
THE ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD

14:40.800 --> 14:42.167
FOR 16 YEARS.

14:42.167 --> 14:43.533
THE RETIRED TEACHER AND GUIDANCE

14:43.533 --> 14:45.133
COUNSELOR IS NOT CONVINCED

14:45.133 --> 14:46.467
MANDATED EXTRA READING TIME IS

14:46.467 --> 14:48.700
THE SOLUTION THAT IT SEEMS.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.200
>> I DON'T THINK IT HAS TRUE

14:50.200 --> 14:52.233
EDUCATIONAL VALUE.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.767
AND I THINK IT COULD BE MORE

14:53.767 --> 14:55.300
HELPFUL IF YOU JUST TAKE YOUR

14:55.300 --> 14:57.567
EYES OFF OF A TEST SCORE.

14:57.567 --> 14:59.633
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

14:59.633 --> 15:01.900
THAT CHILD COMES OUT OF THERE A

15:01.900 --> 15:03.367
BETTER READER OR HAS DEVELOPED A

15:03.367 --> 15:04.867
LOVE OF READING.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.900
IT SIMPLY MEANS THEY'VE JAMMED

15:06.900 --> 15:08.233
UP A RAW SCORE ON A SINGLE

15:08.233 --> 15:10.733
MEASURE TEST.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.167
>> Stewart: AND THERE'S THE

15:12.167 --> 15:13.633
QUESTION: WHO GETS TO DECIDE THE

15:13.633 --> 15:15.233
BEST WAY TO HELP KIDS LEARN?

15:15.233 --> 15:16.933
WHAT WAS THE DEBATE LIKE OR THE

15:16.933 --> 15:19.300
DISCUSSION LIKE WHEN IT FIRST

15:19.300 --> 15:21.400
CAME UP-- "SHOULD WE HAVE KIDS

15:21.400 --> 15:22.100
READ FOR AN EXTRA HOUR AFTER

15:22.100 --> 15:24.033
SCHOOL?"

15:24.033 --> 15:25.533
>> PLEASE... I HAVE TO LAUGH AT

15:25.533 --> 15:27.433
THAT ONE.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.433
THERE WAS NO DEBATE ON THAT.

15:29.433 --> 15:33.467
THERE WAS SIMPLY... THE COMMAND

15:33.467 --> 15:36.667
CAME DOWN FROM THE HILL, "THOU

15:36.667 --> 15:37.600
SHALT PUT AN EXTRA HOUR INTO THE

15:37.600 --> 15:38.433
SCHOOL."

15:38.433 --> 15:39.500
THERE WAS NO DEBATE, THE BOARD

15:39.500 --> 15:40.867
DIDN'T DISCUSS THAT.

15:40.867 --> 15:41.967
LOCAL... THERE WAS NO LOCAL

15:41.967 --> 15:44.500
FEEDBACK INTO THAT.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.933
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT

15:45.933 --> 15:47.567
MANY PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE LAWS

15:47.567 --> 15:48.200
NEVER TAUGHT ONE DAY IN A

15:48.200 --> 15:49.767
CLASSROOM.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.667
>> Stewart: THERE ARE OTHER

15:51.667 --> 15:53.233
CONCERNS AS WELL: DISTRICT

15:53.233 --> 15:54.733
OFFICIALS FIND OUT WHICH SCHOOLS

15:54.733 --> 15:56.267
ARE REQUIRED TO ADD THE EXTRA

15:56.267 --> 15:57.100
READING HOUR JUST WEEKS BEFORE

15:57.100 --> 15:58.967
SCHOOL STARTS.

15:58.967 --> 16:00.633
BUS SCHEDULES HAVE TO CHANGE AND

16:00.633 --> 16:02.500
TEACHING STAFF SECURED.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.133
SOME PARENTS VOICED CONCERN OVER

16:04.133 --> 16:05.900
THE EXHAUSTION LEVEL OF KIDS

16:05.900 --> 16:07.600
WHOSE DAYS ARE PUSHED AN HOUR

16:07.600 --> 16:08.300
LATER, AND THE REDUCTION OF

16:08.300 --> 16:10.067
FAMILY TIME.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.767
AND WHILE KIDS WHO SCORED THE

16:11.767 --> 16:13.067
HIGHEST LEVEL ON THE READING

16:13.067 --> 16:14.567
SECTION OF THE STATE'S

16:14.567 --> 16:16.367
STANDARDIZED TEST CAN OPT OUT,

16:16.367 --> 16:17.867
FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYONE IS

16:17.867 --> 16:20.267
REQUIRED TO STAY THE EXTRA HOUR.

16:20.267 --> 16:22.367
ROACH SAYS THE DATA THAT

16:22.367 --> 16:24.567
SUPPORTERS CITE ONLY TELLS PART

16:24.567 --> 16:25.933
OF THE STORY, AND THAT SIMILAR

16:25.933 --> 16:27.433
STUDENTS WITHOUT THE EXTRA HOUR

16:27.433 --> 16:28.600
OF READING HAVE SHOWN

16:28.600 --> 16:29.567
IMPROVEMENT IN PROFICIENCY IN

16:29.567 --> 16:30.933
THE PAST FEW YEARS.

16:30.933 --> 16:32.500
IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

16:32.500 --> 16:33.567
AND IT HELPS ANYBODY, ISN'T IT

16:33.567 --> 16:35.633
WORTH CONTINUING AND TRYING?

16:35.633 --> 16:37.567
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK FEW PEOPLE

16:37.567 --> 16:39.833
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE FACT

16:39.833 --> 16:43.333
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE KIDS

16:43.333 --> 16:44.333
WHO MAY BE LOW READERS EXTRA

16:44.333 --> 16:46.433
TIME TO READ.

16:46.433 --> 16:47.733
BUT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE TO

16:47.733 --> 16:49.433
THAT.

16:49.433 --> 16:53.000
YOU MAY IN FACT DRIVE UP A

16:53.000 --> 16:54.867
READING SCORE, BUT YOU ALSO LOSE

16:54.867 --> 16:56.433
OTHER-OTHER FEATURES AS WELL.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.333
IF THEY'D GAVE US SOME

16:58.333 --> 17:00.933
OPTIONS... YOU COULD'VE EXTENDED

17:00.933 --> 17:02.667
THE YEAR BY 20 DAYS AND KEPT THE

17:02.667 --> 17:04.667
SAME NUMBER OF HOURS IF YOU LET

17:04.667 --> 17:05.700
LOCAL CONTROL COME INTO PLAY FOR

17:05.700 --> 17:07.567
THE SAME MONEY.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.167
>> Stewart: THE CRITICISM I'VE

17:09.167 --> 17:11.033
HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

17:11.033 --> 17:12.833
FOLKS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN

17:12.833 --> 17:14.100
EDUCATION THAT THEY WORK ON THE

17:14.100 --> 17:15.633
LOCAL LEVEL, THEY'RE IN THE

17:15.633 --> 17:17.133
SCHOOLS, AND THE IDEA THAT THEY

17:17.133 --> 17:18.400
HAVE TO TAKE THIS MONEY, COME UP

17:18.400 --> 17:20.033
WITH IT AND PUT IT JUST ON

17:20.033 --> 17:21.800
READING, EVERYBODY SUPPORTS

17:21.800 --> 17:22.733
READING BUT PERHAPS THAT'S NOT

17:22.733 --> 17:24.767
WHAT THEIR SCHOOL NEEDS.

17:24.767 --> 17:29.267
>> IF THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR

17:29.267 --> 17:31.233
STUDENTS HAVE ON OUR TESTS, YOU

17:31.233 --> 17:33.967
KNOW, STANDARDIZED TESTS, SHOWN

17:33.967 --> 17:37.833
THAT THEY CANNOT READ AT GRADE

17:37.833 --> 17:38.700
LEVEL, THEN THEY NEED READING

17:38.700 --> 17:40.567
INSTRUCTION.

17:40.567 --> 17:42.333
THAT'S A SIMPLE FACT OF LIFE.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.167
>> THUMBS UP IF YOU REMEMBER AND

17:43.167 --> 17:44.667
YOU UNDERSTAND.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.767
>> Stewart: AND THERE'S STILL

17:46.767 --> 17:48.900
THE ISSUE OF FUNDING-- WHO PAYS

17:48.900 --> 17:50.500
FOR IT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.767
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THIS

17:52.767 --> 17:53.533
PROGRAM TO BE GUARANTEED

17:53.533 --> 17:55.467
FUNDING?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.867
RIGHT NOW IT'S YEAR TO YEAR TO

17:57.867 --> 17:58.767
YEAR IF THE DISTRICT CAN COME UP

17:58.767 --> 18:01.000
WITH THE MONEY.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.600
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY

18:03.600 --> 18:05.500
COMMITMENT, NOW THAT WE ARE

18:05.500 --> 18:08.700
SEEING THE PERFORMANCE, THAT WE

18:08.700 --> 18:10.333
WILL IN FACT DEDICATE THE

18:10.333 --> 18:11.133
FUNDING FOR THIS IN ORDER TO GET

18:11.133 --> 18:13.100
THIS ACCOMPLISHED.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.500
>> Stewart: BUT THIS YEAR STATE

18:15.500 --> 18:16.233
LEGISLATORS DID NOT EARMARK NEW

18:16.233 --> 18:17.100
MONEY FOR EXTRA SCHOOL READING

18:17.100 --> 18:18.100
TIME.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.567
SENATOR SIMMONS HAD ALSO

18:19.567 --> 18:20.900
PROPOSED EXPANDING THE MANDATE

18:20.900 --> 18:22.367
TO INCLUDE SUMMER READING

18:22.367 --> 18:23.733
INSTRUCTION AND NOTIFYING

18:23.733 --> 18:25.500
SCHOOLS NO LATER THAN JULY IF

18:25.500 --> 18:26.933
THEY MUST ADD THE EXTRA HOUR OF

18:26.933 --> 18:28.567
READING IN THE FALL.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.167
BUT THE AMENDMENT WAS NOT

18:30.167 --> 18:32.100
SUCCESSFUL.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.833
AMIDST THE DEBATE, PHILLIS

18:33.833 --> 18:35.333
WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY IS COMMITTED

18:35.333 --> 18:36.967
TO KEEPING THE EXTRA HOUR, AND

18:36.967 --> 18:38.433
HAS SOUGHT A FEDERAL GRANT TO

18:38.433 --> 18:40.067
MAKE SURE WHEATLEY CAN PAY FOR

18:40.067 --> 18:41.700
THE LONGER SCHOOL DAY WHETHER IT

18:41.700 --> 18:43.433
IS MANDATED TO OR NOT.

18:43.433 --> 18:45.067
AND IT ISN'T LOST ON ANYONE THAT

18:45.067 --> 18:46.700
THE SCHOOL IS NAMED AFTER

18:46.700 --> 18:48.500
PHILLIS WHEATLEY, A FORMER SLAVE

18:48.500 --> 18:50.433
WHO BECAME A WRITER, THE FIRST

18:50.433 --> 18:51.700
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN POET TO

18:51.700 --> 18:56.867
BE PUBLISHED.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.000
>> Stewart: WATCH OUR REPORT

18:58.000 --> 18:59.267
ABOUT A WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL

18:59.267 --> 19:00.167
DISTRICT THAT HAS STUDENTS IN

19:00.167 --> 19:01.033
CLASS YEAR-ROUND.

19:01.033 --> 19:05.833
VISIT pbs.org/newshour.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.233
>> Stewart: FROM MEASURING THE

19:07.233 --> 19:09.000
READING SKILLS OF ELEMENTARY

19:09.000 --> 19:10.200
SCHOOL STUDENTS, WE TURN TO

19:10.200 --> 19:11.000
TESTING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

19:11.000 --> 19:12.233
EYEING COLLEGE.

19:12.233 --> 19:17.433
THIS YEAR'S SCORES FOR THE

19:17.433 --> 19:18.733
S.A.T., THE STANDARDIZED TEST

19:18.733 --> 19:19.667
TAKEN BY A MAJORITY OF

19:19.667 --> 19:20.533
PROSPECTIVE COLLEGE FRESHMEN,

19:20.533 --> 19:21.500
WERE RELEASED THIS WEEK, AND

19:21.500 --> 19:22.500
THEY ARE THE LOWEST SINCE THE

19:22.500 --> 19:23.633
TEST WAS REVAMPED A DECADE AGO.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.333
THIS YEAR, THE AVERAGE TOTAL

19:25.333 --> 19:26.967
SCORE WAS 1490 OUT OF A POSSIBLE

19:26.967 --> 19:27.900
2400, DOWN FROM 1497 LAST YEAR

19:27.900 --> 19:29.000
AND 1498 THE YEAR BEFORE.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.633
THE AVERAGE MATH SCORE WAS 511

19:30.633 --> 19:31.733
OUT OF A POSSIBLE 800, THE

19:31.733 --> 19:33.700
LOWEST SINCE 1999.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.967
THE AVERAGE READING SCORE WAS

19:35.967 --> 19:39.433
495, THE LOWEST SINCE 1972.

19:39.433 --> 19:40.800
WHAT DO THESE NUMBERS MEAN?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.433
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS THAT

19:42.433 --> 19:43.433
IS "BLOOMBERG NEWS" REPORTER

19:43.433 --> 19:47.333
JANET LORIN.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.333
>> ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

19:48.333 --> 19:49.433
ABOUT THE TEST IN THE PAST YEAR

19:49.433 --> 19:51.367
OR TWO THAT WOULD POINT TO THIS

19:51.367 --> 19:52.100
DECLINE?

19:52.100 --> 19:53.433
>> WE KNOW MORE PEOPLE ARE

19:53.433 --> 19:54.200
TAKING THE TEST.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.567
THIS YEAR WE HAD RECORD NUMBER

19:55.567 --> 19:57.267
OF TEST TAKERS AND PART OF THE

19:57.267 --> 19:58.800
REASON WAS BECAUSE THE COLLEGE

19:58.800 --> 20:02.000
BOARD WAS ABLE TO GET MORE

20:02.000 --> 20:03.867
STATES TO PAY TO TAKE -- FOR

20:03.867 --> 20:04.833
EVERY STUDENT TO TAKE THE TEST.

20:04.833 --> 20:05.467
>> Stewart: OKAY.

20:05.467 --> 20:06.933
>> SO WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE TAKING

20:06.933 --> 20:08.800
IT, THE SOCIOECONOMIC DIVERSITY

20:08.800 --> 20:10.800
IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND

20:10.800 --> 20:11.833
THAT COULD BE CERTAINLY ONE

20:11.833 --> 20:13.100
REASON FOR IT.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.867
NEXT YEAR WE ARE GOING TO SEE

20:14.867 --> 20:16.067
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH

20:16.067 --> 20:18.100
THE SATS STARTING IN MARCH, IT

20:18.100 --> 20:19.767
IS GOING TO BE A COMPLETELY NEW

20:19.767 --> 20:20.633
TEST.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.267
IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK A

20:22.267 --> 20:24.533
LOT MORE HIKE THE ACT, IT IS,

20:24.533 --> 20:26.333
ITS COMPETITOR, YOU WON'T BE

20:26.333 --> 20:29.133
PENALIZED FOR WRONG ANSWERS.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.100
THOSE ESOTERIC WORDS THAT

20:31.100 --> 20:32.433
EVERYBODY STUDIED FOR WILL BE

20:32.433 --> 20:35.167
GONE AND TESTING MORE,

20:35.167 --> 20:36.667
SUPPOSEDLY, WHAT YOU KNOW IN

20:36.667 --> 20:37.967
SCHOOL, AND THERE WILL BE AN

20:37.967 --> 20:39.633
OPTIONAL WRITING TEST.

20:39.633 --> 20:40.600
>> Stewart: LET'S TALK ABOUT

20:40.600 --> 20:42.033
THAT POPULATION A LITTLE BIT.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.967
SO THE POPULATION EXPANDED AND

20:43.967 --> 20:46.267
YOU HAD MORE STUDENTS WHO WERE

20:46.267 --> 20:46.967
PERHAPS UNDERSERVED?

20:46.967 --> 20:47.767
>> YES.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.133
>> Stewart: TAKING THE TEST.

20:49.133 --> 20:49.967
A. YES.

20:49.967 --> 20:51.200
WHEN THE STATE IS PAYING FOR

20:51.200 --> 20:52.900
EVERY STUDENT TO TAKE THE TEST,

20:52.900 --> 20:54.233
YOU HAVE A RANGE OF STUDENTS

20:54.233 --> 20:55.733
TAKING IT, RATHER THAN, YOU

20:55.733 --> 20:58.133
KNOW, TYPICALLY MORE WEALTHY

20:58.133 --> 20:59.300
STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING IT AND

20:59.300 --> 21:00.700
ALSO HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF TEST

21:00.700 --> 21:01.533
PREP.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.133
ONE THING WE HEAR A LOT OF IS

21:03.133 --> 21:04.900
THAT HIGH TEST SCORES CORRELATE

21:04.900 --> 21:06.600
WITH INCOME, SO IT SHOULDN'T BE

21:06.600 --> 21:07.933
SURPRISING THAT WEALTHIER KIDS

21:07.933 --> 21:09.033
DO BETTER ON THIS TEST.

21:09.033 --> 21:11.267
IN FACT, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

21:11.267 --> 21:12.867
YEARS WE RECEIVED QUITE A NUMBER

21:12.867 --> 21:14.200
OF VERY SELECTIVE COLLEGES SAY

21:14.200 --> 21:15.600
WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE THIS AS

21:15.600 --> 21:17.767
A HERB FOR ADMISSIONS.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.167
SCHOOLS WITH SUCH BRAND NAMES

21:19.167 --> 21:21.100
LIKE WESLEY AND CONNECTICUT AND

21:21.100 --> 21:22.033
BRANDEIS.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.700
>> Stewart: SO HOW IS THE SAT

21:23.700 --> 21:25.667
GOING TO STAY RELEVANT IF YOU

21:25.667 --> 21:27.267
HAVE COMPETITIVE COLLEGES

21:27.267 --> 21:28.533
SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:28.533 --> 21:29.467
IT IS OPTIONAL?

21:29.467 --> 21:31.100
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.133
FOR SOME SCHOOLS THAT ATTRACT,

21:33.133 --> 21:35.200
YOU KNOW, 30,000 APPLICATIONS,

21:35.200 --> 21:38.567
THEY STILL WANT SOME, SOME

21:38.567 --> 21:40.433
MEASURE IN ADDITION TO YOUR

21:40.433 --> 21:41.400
GRADE POINT AVERAGE AND OTHER

21:41.400 --> 21:42.100
THINGS.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.067
YOU KNOW, IT IS A WAY TO

21:43.067 --> 21:44.833
BENCHMARK STUDENTS AND WHEN

21:44.833 --> 21:46.700
THEY ARE GETTING THOUSANDS, IT

21:46.700 --> 21:48.833
IS JUST PRACTICAL TO KEEP THAT

21:48.833 --> 21:49.433
REQUIREMENT IN THERE.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.867
>> Stewart: SO THIS WRITING

21:50.867 --> 21:52.300
PORTION OF THE TEST HAS BEEN IN

21:52.300 --> 21:53.567
FOR ABOUT THE PAST DECADE, DID

21:53.567 --> 21:55.300
IT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON THE

21:55.300 --> 21:56.467
LOWER END OF THE TEST SCORES?

21:56.467 --> 21:58.600
>> WELL, THE WRITING TEST YOU

21:58.600 --> 22:03.733
CAN SEE FROM THE CHARTS HAS GONE

22:03.733 --> 22:05.767
DOWN, AND -- SOME PEOPLE HAD

22:05.767 --> 22:07.200
CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE THE

22:07.200 --> 22:08.233
RESULTS COULD BE GAMED.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.533
IT IS WRITING, YOU KNOW, NOT

22:10.533 --> 22:11.800
NECESSARILY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT

22:11.800 --> 22:13.500
WOULD BE FACT BASED, BUT IT

22:13.500 --> 22:15.133
WOULD BE SORT OF LIKE AN ESSAY

22:15.133 --> 22:17.500
AND A CRITICISM WAS YOU COULD

22:17.500 --> 22:19.100
ACTUALLY MEMORIZE A COUPLE OF

22:19.100 --> 22:20.933
POINTS TO INCLUDE AND IT DIDN'T

22:20.933 --> 22:23.933
ACTUALLY MATTER IF IT WAS

22:23.933 --> 22:27.233
FACTUAL AND, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T

22:27.233 --> 22:28.100
NECESSARILY SCORED ABOUT AN

22:28.100 --> 22:29.033
EXCELLENT PIECE OF WRITING.

22:29.033 --> 22:30.600
IT WAS DID YOU USE SOME BIG

22:30.600 --> 22:31.667
WORDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.100
>> Stewart: SO FOLKS ON THE

22:33.100 --> 22:35.033
COLLEGE BOARD AND SAT, WHAT DO

22:35.033 --> 22:36.500
THEY THINK ABOUT THESE SCORES?

22:36.500 --> 22:37.667
HOW ARE THEY DECIDING TO ADDRESS

22:37.667 --> 22:38.167
THIS ISSUE?

22:38.167 --> 22:40.300
>> WELL, THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, OF

22:40.300 --> 22:41.833
COURSE IT IS NOT GOOD, THAT THE

22:41.833 --> 22:42.867
SCORES ARE DOWN BUT PERHAPS

22:42.867 --> 22:44.133
THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY ARE

22:44.133 --> 22:46.500
CHANGING THE TEST TO MEASURE,

22:46.500 --> 22:47.733
YOU KNOW, LEARNING IN A BETTER

22:47.733 --> 22:48.700
WAY.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.133
>> Stewart: JANET LORIN FROM

22:50.133 --> 22:50.967

22:51.567 --> 22:55.900
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.667
>>

22:57.667 --> 22:58.700
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:58.700 --> 23:01.733
SUNDAY.

23:01.733 --> 23:02.867
>> Stewart: THE INTERNATIONAL

23:02.867 --> 23:03.833
AGREEMENT THAT AIMS TO LIMIT

23:03.833 --> 23:04.867
IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

23:04.867 --> 23:05.633
HAS GAINED ONE MORE PROMINENT

23:05.633 --> 23:07.000
SUPPORTER.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.767
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN

23:08.767 --> 23:10.833
POWELL TOLD NBC'S "MEET THE

23:10.833 --> 23:12.700
PRESS" TODAY IT'S A "GOOD DEAL"

23:12.700 --> 23:14.100
THAT WILL REDUCE IRAN'S

23:14.100 --> 23:15.067
STOCKPILE OF ENRICHED URANIUM

23:15.067 --> 23:15.900
AND SHUT DOWN ITS PLUTONIUM

23:15.900 --> 23:18.633
REACTOR.

23:18.633 --> 23:20.833
>> THE REAL ISSUE, I THINK, THAT

23:20.833 --> 23:22.100
CAME DOWN TO THE OPPOSITION IS

23:22.100 --> 23:23.800
"HOW DO YOU VERIFY IT?"

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
AND I'M REMINDED OF WHAT MY

23:25.800 --> 23:27.467
FORMER BOSS, RONALD REAGAN, USED

23:27.467 --> 23:28.967
TO SAY WHEN HE TALKED TO THE

23:28.967 --> 23:31.000
SOVIETS, "TRUST BUT VERIFY."

23:31.000 --> 23:32.567
WITH RESPECT TO THE IRANIANS

23:32.567 --> 23:33.467
IT'S DON'T TRUST, NEVER TRUST,

23:33.467 --> 23:35.233
AND ALWAYS VERIFY.

23:35.233 --> 23:37.133
AND I THINK A VIGOROUS

23:37.133 --> 23:38.733
VERIFICATION REGIME HAS BEEN PUT

23:38.733 --> 23:39.833
IN PLACE WITH THE I.A.E.A. AND

23:39.833 --> 23:40.433

23:40.433 --> 23:41.467
ORGANIZATIONS.

23:41.467 --> 23:42.800
>> Stewart: PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS

23:42.800 --> 23:44.267
ALREADY SECURED ENOUGH SENATE

23:44.267 --> 23:45.833

23:45.833 --> 23:46.800
OF ANY LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

23:46.800 --> 23:49.167
BLOCK THE DEAL.

24:02.367 --> 24:03.367
AFTER IGNORING A FEDERAL JUDGE'S

24:03.367 --> 24:05.000

24:05.000 --> 24:06.867
DAVIS HAS CITED HER CHRISTIAN

BELIEFS AS THE REASON SHE

OPPOSES GAY MARRIAGE.
