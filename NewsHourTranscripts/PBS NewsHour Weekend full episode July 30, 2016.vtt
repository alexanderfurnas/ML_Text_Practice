08:00.947 --> 08:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THAT EXACT PHRASE BY SOME

08:02.682 --> 08:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMAZING COINCIDENCE POPPED UP.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY STRUCTURED EVERY NIGHT

08:06.419 --> 08:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE A POINT, WHETHER IT WAS

08:07.520 --> 08:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT HILLARY, THE

08:08.621 --> 08:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNACCEPTABILITY OF DONALD TRUMP.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN FINALLY AND PERHAPS

08:12.325 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST REMARKABLY, TAKING A PAGE

08:13.626 --> 08:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM REAGAN'S BOOK, THE FLAGS,

08:16.029 --> 08:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, U.S.A.!

08:17.797 --> 08:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S.A.!

08:19.165 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU HAD TRANSPORTED ME 30

08:20.333 --> 08:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS INTO THE FUTURE FROM WHEN

08:21.301 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I FIRST STARTED COVERING IT, I

08:22.469 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD HAVE SAID, "OH, THAT'S A

08:23.269 --> 08:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION."

08:24.237 --> 08:24.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S TALK

08:24.938 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE MESSAGES.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE A

08:29.175 --> 08:30.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUGH TIME CONVINCING PEOPLE TO

08:30.577 --> 08:32.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THEM SO THEY REALLY GO OUT

08:32.479 --> 08:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THEIR WAY TO SAY, "WELL, I'M

08:33.580 --> 08:34.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER

08:34.381 --> 08:35.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON."

08:35.515 --> 08:37.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT IS DEFINITELY THE MAJOR

08:37.183 --> 08:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEME WITH BOTH CAMPAIGNS.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YOU DON'T LIKE ME, CHECK OUT

08:39.386 --> 08:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER PERSON."

08:40.453 --> 08:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE REPUBLICAN CASE, THE

08:42.489 --> 08:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNING REPUBLICANS, LIKE

08:44.824 --> 08:45.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MITCH McCONNELL, THE SENATE

08:45.759 --> 08:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY LEADER; PAUL RYAN, THE

08:47.360 --> 08:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKER, WERE AT PAINS TO SAY,

08:49.729 --> 08:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"OKAY, HE'S NOT REALLY ONE OF

08:51.131 --> 08:52.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE AN AGENDA AND HE'LL GO

08:54.601 --> 08:55.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG WITH IT."

08:55.635 --> 08:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THAT'S WHISTLING IN THE

08:56.669 --> 08:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARK WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT FIND

08:58.304 --> 08:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE WAS,

09:01.775 --> 09:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APART FROM THIS IS NOT LEFT AND

09:04.210 --> 09:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT, THIS IS A REASONABLE

09:07.313 --> 09:08.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON VERSUS AN UNREASONABLE

09:08.782 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE AND ALSO TRYING TO SAY ABOUT

09:10.917 --> 09:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY, OKAY, SHE'S NOT THE

09:12.218 --> 09:13.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARMEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THOUGHT HER ACCEPTANCE

09:14.754 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH, BOTH FOR GOOD AND ILL, I

09:17.023 --> 09:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T DO POETRY.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAN'T REVEAL MYSELF.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I TRY TO REACH FOR FLOWERY

09:21.027 --> 09:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RHETORIC IT TURNS OUT TO BE

09:22.896 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROTARY CLUB LUNCHEON STUFF, BUT

09:24.397 --> 09:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I TALK PLAINLY AND SIMPLY,

09:26.633 --> 09:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE OR

09:27.801 --> 09:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S WRONG WITH TRUMP, THAT'S

09:29.669 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HER MESSAGE, I THINK, JUST

09:32.305 --> 09:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASURED BY POTENTIAL

09:33.640 --> 09:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECTIVENESS, WAS GREATER.

09:35.208 --> 09:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW,

09:35.842 --> 09:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE I THINK

09:37.210 --> 09:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS SHONDA RHIMES MADE THIS

09:38.411 --> 09:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
12-MINUTE BIOPIC VIDEO OF HER,

09:40.680 --> 09:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE SHE

09:42.048 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMED CALM AND RELAXED AND

09:43.516 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMAL SITTING AT A KITCHEN

09:44.451 --> 09:46.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TABLE BUT BY THE TIME SHE GOT IN

09:46.386 --> 09:47.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRONT OF THE TELEPROMPTERS, IT

09:47.687 --> 09:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS BACK TO SOMEONE ELSE.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW

09:53.793 --> 09:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT MICROPHONES THAT CARRY

09:56.563 --> 09:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUND.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON, AS SHE DID

09:58.631 --> 09:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE THE POINT ABOUT DONALD

09:59.766 --> 10:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE

10:00.867 --> 10:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN

10:01.968 --> 10:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERALS.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, DONALD, YOU DON'T.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE

10:05.538 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN ATTEMPTING TO RATCHET UP

10:08.174 --> 10:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RHETORIC.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT'S A POINT I'M

10:10.376 --> 10:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE HER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

10:11.911 --> 10:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELLING HER ABOUT THIS FOREVER.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT MAY BE ONE OF THE THINGS

10:15.048 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH.

10:16.082 --> 10:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, IN

10:16.783 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE END, IN THIS CYCLE

10:18.284 --> 10:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY, DO THESE EVENTS

10:19.919 --> 10:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTER?

10:20.787 --> 10:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE THINK ABOUT THE

10:21.888 --> 10:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEATER AND THE STAGECRAFT AND

10:23.523 --> 10:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ORCHESTRATION-- DID WE BUILD

10:24.958 --> 10:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP TO A CRESCENDO?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST PEOPLE AT HOME MIGHT NOT

10:28.061 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN WATCH THESE.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND THE EVIDENCE OF THAT IS

10:30.730 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FOR ALL OF THE STUMBLES OF

10:31.798 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION,

10:33.566 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP GOT A REASONABLE

10:35.268 --> 10:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOUNCE OUT OF IT, YOU KNOW.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE GOT-- DEPENDING ON WHAT POLL,

10:38.705 --> 10:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR, FIVE, SIX POINGTS.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE POINT YOU MAKE IS MORE

10:41.841 --> 10:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT THAT THIS MAY BE A

10:43.810 --> 10:44.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR WHEN THE LAWS OF POLITICAL

10:44.978 --> 10:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRAVITY ARE IN TEMPORARY

10:46.112 --> 10:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPENSION.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT HOW DONALD TRUMP

10:48.448 --> 10:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT TO THE NOMINATION, HOW MANY

10:50.316 --> 10:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINTS ALONG THE WAY DID PEOPLE

10:51.551 --> 10:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, "WELL, HE CAN'T SURVIVE

10:52.852 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT."

10:54.387 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT OUGHT TO BE A GUIDEPOST

10:55.655 --> 10:58.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE FACT THAT WE SIMPLY ARE

10:58.525 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT SURE WHAT WE ARE WATCHING

11:00.159 --> 11:01.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WE COME OUT OF THE

11:02.061 --> 11:03.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENTIONS, JUST AS YOU SAY, I

11:03.463 --> 11:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW WHAT THE CONVENTIONAL

11:04.397 --> 11:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WISDOM WILL BE, BUT WE HAVE 100

11:06.933 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION

11:08.001 --> 11:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAY, I WOULDN'T BET A PLUG

NICKEL ON KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS.

11:12.205 --> 11:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, I

11:12.906 --> 11:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WON'T TAKE THAT BET.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAND THAT'S BEING SWALLOWED BY

12:03.623 --> 12:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEA.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PAST 60 YEARS, 98% OF

12:07.026 --> 12:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISLAND HAS DISAPPEARED.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IN

12:10.930 --> 12:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1963, ABOUT 11 MILES LONG AND

12:13.766 --> 12:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIVE MILES WIDE.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TODAY, ABOUT TWO MILES LONG AND

12:18.204 --> 12:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A QUARTER OF A MILE WIDE.

NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE THAT HAS

12:22.575 --> 12:23.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED THIS ISLAND HOME SINCE

12:23.776 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE 1800s.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:26.446 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES DURING OUR VISIT FOR PBS

12:28.047 --> 12:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWSHOUR FOUR YEARS AGO.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ALL THAT WATER WAS LAND.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY, IT WAS BASICALLY ALL

12:34.120 --> 12:35.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAND, EXCEPT FOR A FEW PONDS

12:35.822 --> 12:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE AND THERE.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO, DO YOU

12:37.357 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER THIS WHEN YOU WERE

12:38.157 --> 12:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING UP?

12:38.558 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

12:39.258 --> 12:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW'S IT

12:39.926 --> 12:40.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT?

12:40.627 --> 12:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DIFFERENT?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE HAD TREES THERE.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE ACTUALLY TREES UP IN

12:43.563 --> 12:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS AREA.

12:44.163 --> 12:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHERE WE'RE

12:44.897 --> 12:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDING?

12:45.531 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHERE WE'RE STANDING, YES.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THERE ARE

12:47.066 --> 12:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MULTIPLE CAUSES FOR THE

12:47.834 --> 12:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUING LAND LOSS, INCLUDING

12:49.135 --> 12:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECADES OF OIL AND GAS CANALS

12:50.503 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEEDING UP EROSION AND THE

12:52.338 --> 12:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINKING OF THE LAND BY THREE

12:53.973 --> 12:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEET IN THE PAST CENTURY, ALONG

12:56.075 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH EIGHT INCHES OF SEA LEVEL

12:57.944 --> 12:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISE.

12:58.845 --> 12:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE EFFECT?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE 60 OR SO PEOPLE STILL LIVING

13:02.115 --> 13:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE MUST MOVE BECAUSE THE

13:03.950 --> 13:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAND IS BECOMING

13:04.951 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNINHABITABLE.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GULF OF MEXICO IS RAVAGING

13:08.054 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FRESHWATER WETLANDS.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FOREST WHERE RESIDENTS ONCE

13:10.923 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUNTED AND PLANTED GARDENS NOW

13:13.026 --> 13:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ROWS OF DEAD TREES,

13:14.994 --> 13:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POISONED BY ENCROACHING

13:16.262 --> 13:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALTWATER.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN WE MET TRIBE MEMBER CHRIS

13:18.798 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUNET IN 2012, HE WANTED TO

13:20.900 --> 13:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAY ON THE ISLAND.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS LAND MAY NOT BE MUCH,

13:23.970 --> 13:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS LAND IS OURS, AND WE

13:27.874 --> 13:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE STILL HERE.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: BUT NOW, HE'S

13:30.243 --> 13:32.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED TO GO, EVEN THOUGH HE'S

13:32.045 --> 13:34.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVED HERE ALL OF HIS 50 YEARS.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I GOT AROUND TO THINKING,

13:35.548 --> 13:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKAY, ME, AT MY AGE, I COULD

13:38.117 --> 13:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY FINISH OFF MY LIFE OVER

13:40.253 --> 13:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE ON THIS ISLAND.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNGER

13:42.789 --> 13:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATION THAT'S ABOUT TEN, 11,

13:45.191 --> 13:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
12, 13, AND ALL OF THIS HERE?

13:47.627 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I AM FOR THE RELOCATION, MOVING

13:52.198 --> 13:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A COMMUNITY.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT MAKES IT A WHOLE LOT EASIER

13:54.901 --> 13:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WHERE YOU'RE JUST NOT

13:57.470 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGINNING ON YOUR OWN, BUT THAT

13:59.105 --> 14:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MOVING, YOU

14:01.441 --> 14:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, WITH FAMILY.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE TRIBE'S

14:03.443 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST CHOICE IS TO RELOCATE TO

14:04.744 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS 500-ACRE PARCEL OF LAND IN

>> THE PIECE OF LAND THAT WE'RE

14:11.551 --> 14:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT CAME OUT TO BE THE

14:13.319 --> 14:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST OF ALL THAT WE LOOKED AT.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THERE'S NO MARSH,

14:17.890 --> 14:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S TREES, AND IT'S HIGH

14:20.727 --> 14:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUND.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
