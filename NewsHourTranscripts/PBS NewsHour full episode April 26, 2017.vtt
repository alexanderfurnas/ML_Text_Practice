JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.539 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.242 --> 00:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
We're trying to drive the
economic benefit

00:11.044 --> 00:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here to the taxpayers in the
middle.

00:14.614 --> 00:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White House
Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney joins me to
explain the administration's

00:19.919 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tax reform proposal and
President Trump's
plan to get a spending bill
passed.

00:25.992 --> 00:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, a look at the first
100 days of
the Trump presidency, the
progress and setbacks

00:31.731 --> 00:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the domestic front for the
new administration.

00:34.567 --> 00:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a wall keeping people and
wildlife out
-- how a political divide could
endanger animals

00:42.609 --> 00:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living along the U.S.-Mexico
border.

00:44.411 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS,
Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum: Long-term, this could be
a division

00:47.380 --> 00:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of genetical populations, where
a group of
animals from one side cannot
reproduce with

00:52.519 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another group of animals,
breaking the connectivity,
creating some genetical
problems.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.393 --> 01:04.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.464 --> 01:16.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration is
out with the broad strokes of
what it says

01:16.042 --> 01:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be the largest tax reform
in U.S. history.

01:19.779 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plan's main features,
released today,
include cutting corporate tax
rates to 15

01:25.485 --> 01:27.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent from 35 percent.

01:27.487 --> 01:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would also consolidate
existing income
tax brackets into just three,
ranging from

01:33.226 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10 percent to 35 percent.

01:35.161 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it would double the standard
deduction,
while repealing the estate tax.

01:39.899 --> 01:44.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a White House briefing,
Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin promised the plan
will not

01:44.871 --> 01:46.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make the deficit worse.

01:46.739 --> 01:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. Treasury
Secretary: This
will pay for itself with growth
and with reduced

01:50.944 --> 01:56.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reduction of different
deductions, and closing
loopholes.

01:56.382 --> 02:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be working very closely,
as I said,
with the House and Senate to
turn this into

02:01.421 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bill that can be passed and
the president
can sign, and there's lots and
lots of details

02:07.627 --> 02:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going into how that will pay for
itself.

02:09.729 --> 02:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
leaders said the
plan offers critical guideposts
for a tax

02:14.300 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overhaul, but Democrats called
it a massive
tax break for the wealthy.

02:19.906 --> 02:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On another issue, Secretary
Mnuchin said today
that President Trump -- quote --
"has no intention"

02:25.512 --> 02:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of making his own tax returns
public.

02:29.082 --> 02:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress moved closer today to
trying to prevent
a government shutdown on
Saturday.

02:33.786 --> 02:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats said one stumbling
block apparently
fell away when the White House
agreed to continue

02:38.658 --> 02:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subsidies for millions of poor
people under
Obamacare.

02:42.896 --> 02:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, conservative House
Republicans
announced that they will back a
newly revised

02:47.734 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan to repeal and replace
Obamacare.

02:51.304 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not yet clear if moderates
will go along.

02:55.141 --> 02:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word that President
Trump has settled
on a course of action against
North Korea.

02:59.846 --> 03:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A top national security official
says it begins
with diplomacy, but includes a
range of options.

03:06.486 --> 03:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That word came as all 100
senators took a
bus caravan to the White House
for a classified

03:13.159 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefing.

03:14.627 --> 03:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware
was among
those who spoke afterwards.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.299 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS COONS (D), Delaware: I was
encouraged
that they chose to brief the
entire Senate.

03:22.001 --> 03:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the -- it was a
sobering briefing,
in which it was clear just how
much thought

03:27.040 --> 03:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and planning is going into
preparing military
options, if called for, and a
diplomatic strategy

03:32.979 --> 03:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that strikes me as clear-eyed
and well -- well-proportioned
to the threat.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: House members had
their briefing
later at the Capitol.

03:44.023 --> 03:49.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And North Korea issued a new
warning that
it will -- quote -- "go to the
end," apparently

03:49.362 --> 03:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaning a nuclear strike, if
there is an all-out
war with the U.S.

03:54.400 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China today unveiled its first
domestically
built aircraft carrier, the
latest step in

04:00.039 --> 04:02.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a major naval expansion.

04:02.308 --> 04:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vessel slowly slipped into
the water in
the port city of Dalian to much
fanfare.

04:06.980 --> 04:13.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is expected to become
operational by 2020,
after undergoing sea trials.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump today decried a
new legal
blow to his immigration policy.

04:18.024 --> 04:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, a federal district
judge in San
Francisco blocked his order to
withhold funding

04:23.963 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from so-called sanctuary cities,
which seek
to protect many of those who are
undocumented.

04:30.036 --> 04:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president tweeted that the
decision was
-- quote -- "ridiculous" and he
vowed to appeal.

04:34.641 --> 04:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lumped that in with criticism
of the 9th
Judicial Circuit, where
appellate courts also

04:40.613 --> 04:42.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocked his travel ban.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Later, he echoed that complaint:

04:44.417 --> 04:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I'm never surprised by the 9th
Circuit.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:49.522 --> 04:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As I said, we will
see them
in the Supreme Court.

04:54.160 --> 04:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump also
told The Washington
Examiner newspaper that he has
considered

04:59.098 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proposals to split up the 9th
Circuit.

05:02.535 --> 05:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Department of
Homeland Security
formally opened a new office to
help victims

05:07.707 --> 05:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of crimes by undocumented
immigrants.

05:10.943 --> 05:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary John Kelly said that
it will help
shine a light on victims as part
of the president's

05:15.915 --> 05:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
push on illegal immigration.

05:18.384 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Multiple studies show that
native-born Americans
are more likely to commit crimes
than are

05:24.023 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration is
going to review
so-called national monument
designations for

05:30.630 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions of acres of federal
land.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They go back to President
Clinton's time in
office.

05:35.635 --> 05:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump ordered the review at
the U.S. Interior
Department today.

05:39.138 --> 05:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is aimed at what he called a
-- quote -- "massive
federal land grab" that bars
drilling, mining

05:45.611 --> 05:47.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and other uses.

05:47.613 --> 05:51.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Environmental and Native
American tribal groups
denounced the action.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Wall Street gave a little
ground today.

05:53.886 --> 05:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 21 points
to close at 20975.

05:58.624 --> 06:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell a quarter of a
point, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped one point.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I sit down
with White House Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney

06:09.335 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about the president's
budget and tax
priorities; approaching
President Trump's

06:14.140 --> 06:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office, a look
at what he
has accomplished here at home;
and much more.

06:24.183 --> 06:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office, a look
at what he
has accomplished here at home;
and much more.

06:30.590 --> 06:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this day when the White House
is unveiling
the outline of a tax system
overhaul, and

06:35.762 --> 06:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiating down to the wire
over a federal
spending plan to fund the
government through

06:40.867 --> 06:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
September, I sat down with Mick
Mulvaney,
the head of the Office of
Management and Budget.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him at his office
this afternoon,
before there were reports of a
deal on health

06:51.978 --> 06:54.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care subsidies.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Mick Mulvaney, thank
you very much
for talking with us.

06:56.682 --> 06:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
Judy, thank you for having me.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to
start by asking
you about taxes.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the big announcement
coming from the
administration today.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

07:05.124 --> 07:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The proposal,
among other things,
calls for increases in the
standard deductions,

07:09.328 --> 07:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals and families.

07:10.329 --> 07:11.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Yes.

07:11.497 --> 07:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Big cuts in
corporate business
taxes.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the administration
trying to accomplish
with this proposal?

07:17.937 --> 07:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Getting economic
growth back
where it's supposed to be.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we have forgotten
for the last
decade is that America used to
be a fast-growing

07:26.679 --> 07:28.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look over the course of
our 200-plus
years, we're supposed to grow at
about 3 percent,

07:31.784 --> 07:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on average, and that's where we
have been
since World War II, at the very
least, even

07:35.588 --> 07:37.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
further back than that.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for the last decade, we
have been growing
at less than 2 percent.

07:39.325 --> 07:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't sound like much,
but if you think
about it in terms of the power
of compound

07:44.564 --> 07:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest, when you take an
economy our size
that only grows 2 percent a year
for a decade,

07:49.569 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of 3 percent a year, the
difference
between those things are
tremendous.

07:53.506 --> 07:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Folks who are 30 years old have
never had
a job during a time when the
economy was growing

07:59.445 --> 08:00.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at 3 percent.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's entirely different.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was a young person, if
you got fired,
you could find another job.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you wanted to quit, you could
go start
your own company.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't had that for 10 years
now.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're trying to get back to
that.

08:09.722 --> 08:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is what is driving not
only everything
we do at the White House, but
specifically

08:13.826 --> 08:15.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this tax plan.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of the
analysts who
have looked at say, when you put
together

08:18.464 --> 08:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the proposed business tax cuts,
some of the
individual cuts, and when you
look at the

08:23.536 --> 08:29.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposal to do away with some of
the taxes
that are now in the Affordable
Care Act, in

08:29.475 --> 08:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essence, it's the top 1 percent
of Americans,
1 percent of American,
high-income level,

08:35.815 --> 08:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are going to benefit the
most from this.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you answer that?

08:39.452 --> 08:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: I'm not sure how
could they
could come to that conclusion.

08:42.288 --> 08:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would be curious to know what
assumptions
they're making regarding the
value of deductions.

08:46.425 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, we get rid of all
the deductions
on the personal side, except, I
think, let's

08:51.230 --> 08:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see, charity and some of the
home interest
deduction.

08:54.767 --> 08:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm not sure how you could
make that conclusion,
unless you're making some wild
assumptions

08:59.705 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the nature of those
deductions.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you see
the benefits
falling, what income?

09:03.976 --> 09:05.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Middle class.

09:05.611 --> 09:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle class and business, writ
large, both
large business and small
business.

09:09.849 --> 09:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it should be one of the
largest reductions
on small business, what we call
S Corporations,

09:15.855 --> 09:17.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the history of S
Corporations.

09:17.757 --> 09:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're trying to drive the
economic benefit
here to the taxpayers in the
middle, the folks

09:24.797 --> 09:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are in the middle class, who
are paying
the taxes, and the places where
they work.

09:28.034 --> 09:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know the tax
cuts for these
so-called pass-through
businesses, owner-owned

09:33.539 --> 09:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
businesses, are going to be
among the beneficiaries.

09:36.342 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know President Trump, it's
the kind of
business he has.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much does he stand to
benefit?

09:42.014 --> 09:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I ask people of because
people are saying,
we don't know what his tax
income situation

09:47.286 --> 09:48.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has said he's not going to
release that.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the public know that he
doesn't stand
to benefit significantly?

09:53.826 --> 09:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Well, I actually
don't care
about whether or not someone
else benefits.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I care about whether I benefit,
I being just
anybody.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

10:02.134 --> 10:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As long as I'm better off, why
should I care
if somebody is as well?

10:04.537 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I look at through is the
lens of the
business I used to run.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I owned a restaurant.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a fast, fresh Mexican
restaurant.

10:10.576 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I rolled burritos the
day that I
announced I was running for
Congress.

10:14.413 --> 10:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this would be a huge benefit
to us, to
the point where S Corporations
right now pay

10:18.985 --> 10:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax at the pass-through rate,
which is typically
the highest individual rate of
the owners

10:24.190 --> 10:25.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the business.

10:26.025 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You take that number to 15
percent, it allows
me to keep a lot more money in
my business.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I would have done, had
I still been
in that line of work, is start
preparing to

10:33.899 --> 10:35.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
open another restaurant.

10:35.701 --> 10:39.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I also want to
ask you about
the revenue loss that comes from
all these

10:39.038 --> 10:40.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax cuts.

10:40.806 --> 10:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration at one point
was talking
about a border tax, some kind of
adjustable

10:45.478 --> 10:46.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax at the border.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That doesn't appear to be part
of the proposal
right now.

10:50.850 --> 11:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you address significant
drop in revenue,
at a time when the country is --
has deficits

11:00.292 --> 11:01.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are historic?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

11:02.361 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can talk about deficits
more.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I want to.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's talk about -- you
asked a couple
different things, which is the
border tax.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind that this is the
first round
of discussions.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a pre-cooked bill.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not prepackaged.

11:14.740 --> 11:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of our principles,
so just because
it's not in this first round of
principles

11:19.679 --> 11:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't mean it won't be in a
final version
of the bill.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is interested in
trying to figure
out a way to tax imports,
especially from

11:26.719 --> 11:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries that tax our exports.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding the revenue loss, keep
in mind that
the corporate income tax only
generates, I

11:33.192 --> 11:36.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, about only $300 billion a
year.

11:36.696 --> 11:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can do a fairly good bit
within the
corporate tax, and not cost a
lot of revenue.

11:43.069 --> 11:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally -- and you have
heard Secretary
Mnuchin talk about this today --
we're hoping

11:47.273 --> 11:51.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for really, really good growth
from these
numbers, from this tax reform.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you know,
when big
tax cuts instituted during the
presidency

11:54.780 --> 11:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Ronald Reagan, that growth
didn't materialize.

11:57.583 --> 12:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ended up having to raise
taxes again
by the end of his
administration.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Actually, that's
not true.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did get really good growth
from the Reagan
years.

12:06.926 --> 12:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You saw GDP grow at very high
rates as we
came out of the recession,
something that

12:11.263 --> 12:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't happen at the end of the
recession
in 2007-2008.

12:16.001 --> 12:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama chose to deal
with his recession
by increasing regulations and
getting government

12:21.373 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more involved in the economy.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Reagan decided to do
the exact opposite.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Reagan got a
tremendous result in
terms of economic growth.

12:27.847 --> 12:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama gave us eight
years without
3 percent growth.

12:31.684 --> 12:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do think history shows us,
if we do
the tax reform right, that we
can put people

12:36.889 --> 12:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to work and grow the
economy.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
move on to
the budget.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

12:41.227 --> 12:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You finish up the
fiscal year
later on.

12:45.498 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we don't know if
there's an agreement
on a spending -- on a spending
plan for the

12:50.936 --> 12:51.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rest of this year.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does that stand right now?

12:53.839 --> 12:56.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: That is a really,
really good
question, and I don't know
either, which bothers

12:56.509 --> 12:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me a little bit, because I'm the
budget director.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we had thought we had a deal
on Monday.

13:02.515 --> 13:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats had objected to
our inclusion
of the bricks-and-mortar portion
of the border

13:07.720 --> 13:08.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wall.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said that that was a poison
pill.

13:11.257 --> 13:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to sort of drive home their
point, they
said, well, now we want these
cost-sharing

13:18.130 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payments, cost -- the CSR
payments, cost-sharing
reduction payments to the
insurance industry

13:23.335 --> 13:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as part of the Obamacare.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: And they said --
they put that
on after they found out our
request for the

13:28.174 --> 13:29.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wall.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we took the wall request
away on Monday.

13:30.676 --> 13:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're still waiting for the
Democrats
to let us know where they stand.

13:33.746 --> 13:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we thought we had a deal on
Monday, almost
48 hours ago now, and we have no
idea where

13:39.151 --> 13:40.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democrats are.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know if they're doing
internal polling
that maybe says they're going to
benefit from

13:44.356 --> 13:46.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a shutdown.

13:46.225 --> 13:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're really -- we're not
concerned yet, but
I'm a little surprised that we
haven't buttoned

13:49.328 --> 13:51.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this up.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the
administration, are
you, the president, prepared to
go ahead with

13:54.667 --> 14:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a spending arrangement that
doesn't include
these payments to -- subsidy
payments to insurance

14:02.741 --> 14:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies that help low-income
Americans?

14:04.443 --> 14:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Well, that's the
whole idea,
is that the bipartisan bill that
is being

14:08.280 --> 14:13.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- that I think has been
negotiated now for
three months, two months, on the
Hill never

14:13.118 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
included those payments until
about two weeks
ago.

14:15.721 --> 14:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just assumed when we gave
up on our
immediate demands for the
bricks-and-mortar

14:20.860 --> 14:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wall that the Democrats would do
the same
thing.

14:22.928 --> 14:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some reason, they're not
being straightforward
yet about what they want to do
on those payments.

14:27.266 --> 14:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House,
you mentioned
the wall, the fact that the
president initially

14:30.903 --> 14:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said this was something he felt
very strongly
about.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had to be -- there had to be
money in there
to pay for a bricks-and-mortar
wall.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What signal that does it send,
though, that
he -- that was a centerpiece of
his campaign.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Yes.

14:43.315 --> 14:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day after we sign the bill
that keeps
the government open for the last
five months

14:47.953 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the fiscal year -- our fiscal
year ends
the end of September -- the
discussions begin

14:52.658 --> 14:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediately for the larger
budget for the
full 2018 fiscal year.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, that's the budget we
happen to be
working on today as well.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're doing '17 and '18 at the
same time.

15:02.768 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those conversations will have
actually already
started in terms of what wall
funding will

15:07.673 --> 15:08.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in 2018.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think it's fair to
say he's dropped
anything.

15:11.076 --> 15:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We simply said, look, this is
the last five
months of the fiscal year.

15:16.482 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's very little we can get
built in five
months anyway, so let's focus
instead on things

15:20.252 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we agree on.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats say they support
border security.

15:23.622 --> 15:29.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2006, for example,
then-Senator Obama voted
for a lot of the stuff we're
asking for right

15:29.128 --> 15:30.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's not a
lessening of
his -- that this is a priority
for him?

15:33.532 --> 15:36.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: It's simply a
recognition of
the fact that we only have five
months left

15:36.669 --> 15:38.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the year anyway.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the only discussion we're
having right
now, and that there are other
things we can

15:40.706 --> 15:41.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree on.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, let's agree on them.

15:43.075 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's fund the government and
let's start
talking about 2018.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're coming up on the 100-day
mark.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: I'm familiar with
it.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I have heard a little bit
about it.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For President
Trump.

15:52.084 --> 15:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, there are critics,
even friends
of the administration out there,
who are saying,

15:57.122 --> 16:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has been a rocky beginning
for this administration,
that you haven't been able to
get as much

16:02.161 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done as you wanted.

16:04.296 --> 16:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pulling back -- Obamacare hasn't
been repealed
and replaced, the border wall
that we have

16:08.701 --> 16:10.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just been discussing.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you see these first 100
days?

16:11.971 --> 16:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: A lot of the
stuff that was
entirely in our control, I think
we have actually

16:16.575 --> 16:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exceed our own expectations.

16:18.010 --> 16:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can talk about the number of
bills that
the president has signed.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's been at least
13, more than
any president since World War
II, the number

16:26.652 --> 16:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of executives orders that we
have issued.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, it's not just number of
these things,
but what they have done.

16:31.957 --> 16:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By passing this legislation, we
have undone
a lot of the regulatory regime
that the previous

16:36.562 --> 16:37.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
administration put in.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have undone a lot of damage
they did with
our executive orders.

16:40.566 --> 16:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have actually been able
to reduce role
of government in your life a
great deal in

16:46.538 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the first 100 days.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We take that as a huge success.

16:49.541 --> 16:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think President Trump is the
first president
since the 1880s to have a
Supreme Court justice

16:55.114 --> 16:56.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first 100 days.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we have not gotten health
care done.

16:58.384 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we're just starting tax
reform today.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But keep in mind those are
things we had to
work with Congress, and Congress
turned out

17:04.423 --> 17:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a lot more broken than we
thought it
was.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of the reasons we
think the Democrats
have not responded on our
funding proposals

17:11.663 --> 17:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this year is that they don't
want to give
it to us within the first 100
days.

17:15.834 --> 17:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's how poisonous the
atmosphere is
that we're working in, that they
sort of agreed

17:20.372 --> 17:22.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in principle.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to say yes, but they
won't say yes
until after the 100 days to deny
that to the

17:25.110 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just absurd.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the folks back home pay the
price for
that, which is unfortunate.

17:29.214 --> 17:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney,
thank you very much.

17:36.722 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Thanks, Judy.

17:41.593 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a very
different view of
the president's tax plans.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes it from
here.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In addition to
cutting the
corporate rate and reducing the
number of

17:52.604 --> 17:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax brackets, the president's
blueprint calls
for eliminating the Alternative
Minimum Tax,

17:57.776 --> 18:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or AMT, as well as the estate
tax.

18:00.446 --> 18:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would also eliminate any
taxes on the first
$24,000 of a couple's earnings.

18:05.984 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would cut all itemized
deductions,
except for two big ones,
mortgage interest

18:10.422 --> 18:11.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and charitable giving.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by Jared
Bernstein.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's an economist who served in
the Obama
administration.

18:16.462 --> 18:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a fellow at the Center
on Budget
and Policy Priorities.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN, Former Chief
Economist to
Vice President Joe Biden: Thank
you.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: First reaction
to the president's
tax proposal?

18:24.870 --> 18:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: There are a lot
of problems
with this proposal.

18:27.406 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can think of three or four
right off the
top of my head, first of all on
the revenues.

18:32.144 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a tax plan, even though
we don't know
all the details yet, what we do
know suggests

18:37.616 --> 18:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very clearly that this is going
to lead to
a loss of north of at least $3
trillion to

18:45.524 --> 18:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the treasury, and it could be as
much as $6
trillion.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's over 10 years.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
potentially big deficit
hits.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Big deficit.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Big deficit debt hits.

18:53.832 --> 18:59.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are argument that the
growth effects
of these tax cuts will offset
those revenue

18:59.938 --> 19:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
losses, those arguments are
completely unfounded.

19:03.275 --> 19:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's just not a shred of
evidence, not
a shred, that tax cuts pay for
themselves

19:08.981 --> 19:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the totality, which is what
they're suggesting.

19:11.316 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not to say that tax cuts
can't have
some growth effects, but they
tend to be really

19:16.221 --> 19:17.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quite small.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's the first point.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The growth point was number two.

19:22.327 --> 19:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The third point -- and I really
think Director
Mulvaney got this pretty
backwards -- was,

19:28.066 --> 19:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this tax cut plan exacerbates
after-tax inequality.

19:33.305 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means most its benefits
accrue to those
at the very top of the scale.

19:37.042 --> 19:40.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can go through some of the
details, some
of the pieces that you announced
that generate

19:40.479 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that effect, but it mostly has
to do with
this very sharp cut in the
corporate rate

19:45.150 --> 19:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this pass-through rate that
you heard
him talk about.

19:47.786 --> 19:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally -- and this relates
to this pass-through
problem -- this tax plan oppose
up a huge

19:53.091 --> 19:54.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loophole.

19:54.893 --> 20:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every high-end earner has an
incentive now
to become an independent
business, an S Corp,

20:02.634 --> 20:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an LLC, to take advantage of a
pass-through
rate is now going to be 15, 20
percentage

20:09.374 --> 20:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points below what they would
otherwise pay.

20:11.843 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary
Mnuchin in his
briefing today -- and you heard
Mick Mulvaney

20:15.647 --> 20:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make the same argument -- they
argue that
these taxes are geared largely
to middle-income

20:21.220 --> 20:22.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
earn earners.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't see any evidence that
there's targeted
tax breaks for them in this?

20:26.124 --> 20:33.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Just a
slightest bit, which
is this increase in the standard
deduction.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's going to help some
folks at the
bottom.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But that's tiny.

20:37.336 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vast majority of the revenue
losses that
I was describing, the trillions
that are not

20:42.774 --> 20:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be flowing to the
treasury if this
tax cut ever becomes law, very
much swamp

20:49.314 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything to the middle class.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me give you an example.

20:52.284 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sounds to me very similar
to a House
plan that was written by Paul
Ryan quite recently.

20:58.056 --> 21:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with that plan, the top 1
percent, their
after-tax income went up 11
percent.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's about $240,000.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

21:06.698 --> 21:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The middle class, their income
went up 0.1
percent, which we can just call
zero.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's 60 bucks.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's the kind of imbalance
we're looking
at here.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I mean when I
say this really
exacerbates a problem we already
have, which

21:20.012 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is one of high levels of
inequality.

21:22.247 --> 21:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You heard Judy
and Mick
Mulvaney talk about these
pass-through companies

21:25.917 --> 21:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the huge tax cut that
they're going to
be getting.

21:28.253 --> 21:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you explain what those
companies are and
what that tax cut would mean?

21:31.523 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: These are the
small businesses,
but they're not the moms and
pops.

21:34.059 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was another misleading part
of that.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, they
argue that this
is -- that that is largely a tax
cut for small

21:38.697 --> 21:40.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, that's --
well, it is
a tax cut for some small
business, but which

21:42.934 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
small businesses are we talking
about?

21:44.736 --> 21:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moms and pops, you think
about the corner
store, they're already paying a
low rate on

21:49.207 --> 21:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their pass-through income,
something close
to the 15 percent that we're
talking about.

21:54.246 --> 22:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ones who get the huge break
here are high-end
small businesses, you know, law
firms and

22:00.752 --> 22:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private equity funds and hedge
funds.

22:03.221 --> 22:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, the point here is
that, if you're
being paid a high salary, you
now -- which

22:08.827 --> 22:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to pay on your personal
income side,
which, under their plan, would
be 35 percent,

22:13.432 --> 22:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you now have a very big, very
tempting incentive
to go to your boss and say,
starting tomorrow,

22:20.639 --> 22:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're no longer paying me a
paycheck.

22:22.307 --> 22:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Jared Bernstein LLC, and I'm
going to
tap that 30 -- that 15 percent
loophole.

22:27.946 --> 22:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You're a
veteran of a lot
of tax battles in the Congress
and the Senate

22:31.883 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the administration.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't this just the opening
salvo of the Trump
administration?

22:36.955 --> 22:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is their beginning of their
negotiating
position?

22:38.957 --> 22:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: It is an
opening salvo.

22:40.559 --> 22:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's an important
point and we shouldn't
forget that.

22:43.261 --> 22:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is that the -- this
opening salvo
goes completely in the wrong
direction.

22:48.500 --> 22:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are a society, an economy, a
government
that is going to need more
revenues in the

22:53.972 --> 22:55.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
future, not less.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Think about demographics alone.

22:57.175 --> 23:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The share of elderly people in
our country
is going to go from 15 to about
21 percent

23:03.215 --> 23:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the next couple of decades.

23:04.483 --> 23:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, that's baked in the cake.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's going to happen.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That creates certain budgetary
pressures.

23:09.020 --> 23:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the idea that we're even
starting with
an opening salvo that's going to
keep, you

23:14.126 --> 23:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, $3 trillion, $4 trillion,
$5 trillion
over 10 years of going into the
coffers at

23:19.564 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the treasury is starting from
precisely the
wrong place.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jared
Bernstein, thanks
very much for your analysis.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: My pleasure.

23:27.572 --> 23:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:37.949 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
hell on earth,
a new striking documentary on
Syria and its

23:43.588 --> 23:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil war; walled-off, the
proposed U.S.-Mexico
border wall putting endangered
species at

23:50.996 --> 23:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk; and remembering Jonathan
Demme, the
director who brought us "Silence
of the Lambs."

23:58.103 --> 24:02.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As President Trump
nears his 100th
day in office, White House
correspondent John

24:02.841 --> 24:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yang begins our look at his
accomplishments
and setbacks, with a focus on
the home front.

24:08.947 --> 24:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For President Trump,
today's tax
announcement amounted to a
campaign promise

24:15.687 --> 24:17.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kept.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It's a great plan.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to put people back
to work.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It comes as he nears
his 100th
day in office.

24:23.929 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump dismisses that
milestone as
not very meaningful and a
ridiculous standard,

24:28.967 --> 24:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even as administration officials
aggressively
push his accomplishments online
and on-camera.

24:33.672 --> 24:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
When you think about what he's
started, it's

24:37.309 --> 24:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a huge, hugely successful
first 100 days.

24:40.378 --> 24:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump came to the
White House
intent on shaking things up,
changing how

24:44.850 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Washington works.

24:46.184 --> 24:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He and his advisers have focused
on asserting
executive action.

24:49.488 --> 24:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is on track to sign the most
executive
orders in his first 100 days
since World War

24:55.060 --> 24:56.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
II.

24:56.962 --> 25:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But like other presidents bent
on changing
Washington, he's run into
obstacles in Congress

25:01.366 --> 25:02.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in the courts.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There have been clear victories.

25:05.770 --> 25:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration officials tout
the confirmation
of Supreme Court Justice Neil
Gorsuch, though

25:09.975 --> 25:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans had to change Senate
rules to
do it.

25:12.744 --> 25:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I got it done
in the first
100 days.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's even nice.

25:17.382 --> 25:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he moved quickly
to revive
construction of the Keystone
pipeline with

25:21.453 --> 25:23.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive action.

25:23.488 --> 25:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The courts have stymied other
executive actions,
like his immigrant travel ban,
and, just yesterday,

25:28.693 --> 25:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his effort to strip federal
funding from so-called
sanctuary cities.

25:33.298 --> 25:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While stinging from those court
actions, administration
officials say the president's
tough talk has

25:38.603 --> 25:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to a sharp drop in illegal
crossings over
the southern border since
January, reversing

25:44.042 --> 25:46.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nearly 20-year trend.

25:46.711 --> 25:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has also reversed
himself on some
campaign promises, such as not
declaring China

25:51.483 --> 25:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a currency manipulator, as he
had pledged
to do in campaign rallies across
America.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What should have
done years
ago.

25:58.590 --> 26:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now the White
House is working
to turn around the most
embarrassing setback

26:03.028 --> 26:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his first 100 days, the
initial failure
to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care

26:08.900 --> 26:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act, or Obamacare, a signature
pledge of his
campaign.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We were very
close.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a very, very tight
margin.

26:16.007 --> 26:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That episode shook
some administration
officials' confidence in House
Speaker Paul

26:21.212 --> 26:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ryan's ability to deliver votes.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
came really close today, but we
came up short.

26:26.651 --> 26:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On tax reform and on
other major
legislative initiatives in the
near future,

26:31.890 --> 26:36.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
such as the promised
infrastructure rebuilding,
there are indications the White
House intends

26:36.394 --> 26:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to chart its own course as they
search for
the victories the president
wants to turn

26:40.832 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his vision of making America
great again into
a reality.

26:45.203 --> 26:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

26:48.940 --> 26:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
President Trump's
first 100 days, and how he
compares to his

26:54.012 --> 26:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predecessors, I am joined by
Barbara Perry,
director of presidential studies
at the University

26:59.417 --> 27:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Virginia's Miller Center, and
presidential
historian and "NewsHour" regular
Michael Beschloss.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael, I'm going to start with
you.

27:09.594 --> 27:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, remind us quickly, where
did this 100-day
standard come from?

27:13.198 --> 27:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
It came from Franklin Roosevelt.

27:15.266 --> 27:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had 100 days that started a
couple days
after -- a few days after he was
inaugurated.

27:20.505 --> 27:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was trying to deal with
the Great Depression
and had this amazing success
with Congress,

27:25.844 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting all this legislation,
fixing the banks,
trying to relieve the poor,
Tennessee Valley

27:31.449 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authority, Public Works, a kind
of legislative
record that we probably will not
see again.

27:38.523 --> 27:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every president since then
has hated it,
because they're measured against
this almost-unreal

27:43.762 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standard.

27:45.530 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Barbara
Perry, here we
are, almost 100 days in for
President Trump.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does he compare to his
predecessors at
this point?

27:50.835 --> 27:52.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARBARA PERRY, Director,
University of Virginia
Miller Center: Depends on what
you want to

27:52.537 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compare him on.

27:54.439 --> 27:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you want to look at,
let's say, executive
orders, certainly, in terms of
the numbers,

27:59.911 --> 28:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would be right up there in
the categories
of most presidents.

28:03.815 --> 28:10.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as Michael said, in
reference to legislation,
I think FDR passed 76 laws in
the first 100

28:10.955 --> 28:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days through a very amenable
Congress.

28:13.958 --> 28:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, Trump is not going to
come anywhere
near that record, and probably
no other president

28:19.531 --> 28:21.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will either.

28:21.466 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say, certainly on
executive orders,
on the Supreme Court appointment
of Neil Gorsuch,

28:25.937 --> 28:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he gets A's in terms of getting
what he wanted
based on some of the promises
that he made

28:32.010 --> 28:33.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the campaign.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, how do
you see him
compared to others?

28:35.180 --> 28:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think I
would say it
a little differently, because
Trump made such

28:38.316 --> 28:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a point before the campaign just
before the
election, saying, elect me.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a referendum on my
100-day action
plan.

28:45.957 --> 28:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will get all these things
through Congress
with a Republican Congress,
which he has had.

28:51.629 --> 28:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in retrospect, as you do
say, this has
been 100 days with almost
nothing of great

28:58.536 --> 29:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
importance, despite the fact
that he had promised
health care reform and big tax
reform, which

29:03.942 --> 29:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's getting to this week and a
number of
other things, border wall.

29:08.246 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're looking at the 100
days largely
as a legislative standard -- and
that is what

29:13.084 --> 29:18.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is usually is in history --
Trump is really
pretty low down on the list.

29:18.056 --> 29:23.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Barbara,
Michael referenced
where this 100-day standard
comes from, but

29:23.128 --> 29:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how often do presidents get a
lot done early
on in their administration?

29:27.098 --> 29:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: It depends on the
president,
of course.

29:29.601 --> 29:34.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at someone like
Lyndon Johnson,
who had, of course, two first
days -- first

29:34.739 --> 29:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 days, one after the Kennedy
assassination,
and then being elected in his
own right, but

29:39.577 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly after the 1964
election, in 1965,
as he moved forward with the
Great Society,

29:45.650 --> 29:51.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicare and Medicaid, and the
Voting Rights
Act of 1965, so we will point to
a president

29:51.990 --> 29:53.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

29:53.358 --> 29:57.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, no one will ever again
standard of
FDR in legislation.

29:57.295 --> 30:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also look out where they come
out in the
first 100 days on approval
ratings, which

30:02.901 --> 30:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a fascinating parlor game to
play.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know this president coming
in, of course,
came in with the lowest entering
approval

30:09.207 --> 30:11.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rating of any president.

30:11.142 --> 30:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it also doesn't matter
necessarily if
you make a mistake, because the
person with

30:14.679 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the highest rating after 100
days is John
F. Kennedy, after the Bay of
Pigs.

30:18.983 --> 30:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way he handled that
issue by going
before the American people and
saying, I'm

30:23.822 --> 30:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsible for this, I'm the
responsible
officer of the government,
caused his approval

30:28.092 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ratings to spike even further.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he comes in with an 83
percent rating.

30:32.730 --> 30:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know Trump's approval ratings
is down in
the low 40s at this point.

30:36.201 --> 30:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dig a little
deeper there,
Michael, in terms of how Donald
Trump has

30:40.238 --> 30:43.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
done compared to other
presidents.

30:43.041 --> 30:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You started to talk about this a
moment ago
with the setting of the
standard.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But how does he stack up?

30:48.713 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, you
know, a lot of
this, you know, what presidents
do, above

30:51.549 --> 30:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and beyond their congressional
record, is,
do they expand the base that
they had on Election

30:56.421 --> 30:57.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day?

30:57.789 --> 31:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, you know, got,
what, 47 percent
of the popular vote.

31:01.059 --> 31:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he is down to about 40,
which would suggest
that, if anything, he's
alienated some of

31:06.097 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the people who voted for him.

31:08.299 --> 31:12.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, with presidents you see
-- and this
is true of almost every
president back to

31:12.237 --> 31:14.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FDR -- the opposite.

31:14.105 --> 31:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get elected, they say, I
need people
who didn't vote for me, who are
skeptical

31:17.809 --> 31:18.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of me.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to reach out to them.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm the president of all the
people.

31:22.247 --> 31:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see the numbers go up
because people
appreciate the fact that they
are reaching

31:26.150 --> 31:27.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

31:27.952 --> 31:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the one thing Donald
Trump -- and
this has been his own choice --
has not done.

31:30.655 --> 31:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's essentially said, I'm happy
with my base.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will play to them.

31:35.627 --> 31:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not going to make a big
effort to reach
out to Democrats and
independents in Congress

31:41.165 --> 31:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or out among the American
people.

31:43.034 --> 31:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the numbers show
that he's paid
for that.

31:45.637 --> 31:52.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other feature
of this presidency
has been his unusual attacks, if
you will,

31:52.176 --> 31:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barbara, on the judiciary.

31:53.978 --> 31:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time and again, he has singled
out the courts,
judges, justices when he didn't
like what

31:59.117 --> 32:00.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they ruled.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: He has, which is
a little odd,
in the sense that his sister is
a federal

32:04.088 --> 32:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judge, and a circuit judge at
that.

32:06.925 --> 32:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is following in the
footsteps of some
other presidents, and we can
point directly

32:11.396 --> 32:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to FDR, for example, who took on
the judiciary
headlong, not necessarily even
in the first

32:17.669 --> 32:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term, but certainly once he was
reelected
by a landslide in '36, and
famously, or infamously,

32:22.073 --> 32:23.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tried to pack the court.

32:23.975 --> 32:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I always go back to a speech
that he gave
in which he said, the two
branches of government,

32:27.845 --> 32:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president and Congress, are
pulling a wagon.

32:29.814 --> 32:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two horses pulling in
the same direction,
and the court, particularly the
Supreme Court,

32:33.451 --> 32:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which kept striking down his
many pieces of
New Deal legislation, is pulling
in the opposite

32:38.022 --> 32:39.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a metaphor that the
American people
could understand.

32:41.192 --> 32:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they never supported in the
main or for
the majority his court-packing
plan.

32:45.663 --> 32:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's not so
unusual, Michael.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is -- there has been a
frequency we
haven't seen.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think
that's right.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Reagan talked about
unelected judges.

32:55.907 --> 33:00.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Trump's case, you have
had -- and this
is historically unusual -- two
big executive

33:00.812 --> 33:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orders within these first 100
days, including
most recently sanctuary cities,
and earlier

33:06.584 --> 33:08.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the travel ban.

33:08.319 --> 33:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each time, he would say, almost
in anger,
this was something that an
unelected judge

33:13.725 --> 33:16.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did, or something that a
so-called judge did.

33:16.728 --> 33:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sort of the opposite of
conservatism,
because one of the things that
is most fundamental

33:20.965 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in being a conservative is
having respect
for the democratic institutions
that we think

33:27.538 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are important.

33:29.407 --> 33:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk,
finally, Barbara,
about what the first 100 days
tells us about

33:32.477 --> 33:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rest of a presidency.

33:34.479 --> 33:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what extent can we look at
Donald Trump's
first few months in office and
say this forecasts

33:40.118 --> 33:41.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether he's going to be
successful or not?

33:41.919 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: Well, I'm from
Louisville,
Kentucky, originally, and we're
about to do

33:45.089 --> 33:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kentucky Derby, so I say a
horse can stumble
out of the gate or it can be
running last

33:49.861 --> 33:50.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first third...

33:50.862 --> 33:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Absolutely.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: ... and still
come on to win.

33:53.664 --> 33:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to the point about low
approval ratings
and Michael's point about not
necessarily

33:58.503 --> 34:02.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accomplishing all of the list of
things he
said he would do in the 100 days
doesn't mean

34:02.440 --> 34:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he won't be reelected or
that he will
have a failed presidency.

34:05.510 --> 34:10.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you think of someone like
Bill Clinton,
who had a rather chaotic start
in a host of

34:10.681 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways in those first 100 days,
and even up
to the Oklahoma City bombing in
1995, and

34:16.554 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were saying, oh, it's the
shrinking
presidency and the shrinking
Bill Clinton

34:19.657 --> 34:21.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as president, and yet he came on
strong.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we know that he was
reelected in '96.

34:24.128 --> 34:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not a Ouija board.

34:25.997 --> 34:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a professor, I would say
to the students
in the first third of the
semester, if they

34:30.068 --> 34:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scored lower than they wanted on
the first
test, I would say, you have more
tests to

34:33.871 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do, you have a term paper,
participate in
class.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Trump still has many more
things on which
to be graded.

34:39.877 --> 34:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this first...

34:41.179 --> 34:42.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:42.180 --> 34:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I totally
agree with that.

34:44.082 --> 34:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that it's a standard
that historically
doesn't tell us a lot, because
think of all

34:48.453 --> 34:51.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these presidents and what turns
out to be
important about their
administration, these

34:51.956 --> 34:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moments like Kennedy and the
missile crisis,
or Johnson and the Vietnam
escalation, or

34:56.994 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
George W. Bush and 9/11.

34:58.496 --> 35:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of those things happened in
the first
-- during the first 100 days.

35:02.567 --> 35:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we were having a great
conversation
like this 100 days into each of
those presidencies,

35:08.506 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we wouldn't have been able to
predict what
historians now think was really
turning out

35:13.277 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be pivotal.

35:14.645 --> 35:16.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, Barbara
Perry, thank you both.

35:16.414 --> 35:17.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Thank you,
Judy.

35:17.415 --> 35:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: Thank you, Judy.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow, we
will take
a look at the Trump
administration's successes

35:22.086 --> 35:32.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and setbacks overseas within its
first 100
days.

35:32.130 --> 35:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and setbacks overseas within its
first 100
days.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a look at a new film about
the brutal
Syrian civil war.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story.

35:44.876 --> 35:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The French
government said
today its analysis of samples
from a chemical

35:49.914 --> 35:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack in Syria earlier this
month prove that
the government of Bashar
al-Assad was responsible.

35:55.353 --> 35:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That attack was one more flash
point in a
war that has now entered its
seventh year,

35:59.724 --> 36:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it is the subject of a
searing new documentary
called "Hell on Earth: The Fall
of Syria and

36:04.729 --> 36:06.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Rise of ISIS."

36:06.531 --> 36:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It debuts at the Tribeca Film
Festival this
week here in New York, and will
air later

36:10.034 --> 36:11.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this summer on National
Geographic.

36:11.903 --> 36:17.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is co-directed by the
journalist and author
Sebastian Junger, who also
narrates the film.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

36:18.876 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER, Director,
"Hell on Earth:
The Fall of Syria and the Rise
of ISIS": Thank

36:19.143 --> 36:20.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

36:20.077 --> 36:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why make this
right now?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: We started
about two years
ago.

36:22.980 --> 36:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wanted to explain why the
Syrian civil
war happened, how it evolved,
and particularly

36:28.686 --> 36:30.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why ISIS came out of it.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ISIS is a kind of rare
phenomenon.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we wanted to explain that to
the American
people.

36:35.359 --> 36:39.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But there's a
family that
you intersperse throughout this
documentary.

36:39.096 --> 36:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are making their way out of
Syria, or
attempting to as they go along.

36:43.501 --> 36:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a real telling clip
early on in
the film where there's a father
just trying

36:47.238 --> 36:48.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to comfort his kids.

36:48.339 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Don't
be afraid,
dear.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't be afraid.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(CRYING)

36:54.712 --> 37:02.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Honestly, I'm about
to explode.

37:02.887 --> 37:07.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I can't express what is
happening inside of
me.

37:07.992 --> 37:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to smile against my will,
so the kids
don't get scared.

37:12.897 --> 37:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is
juxtaposed with
a phrase that you have from
Syrian President

37:18.236 --> 37:21.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar al-Assad saying, we don't
indiscriminately
bomb anyone.

37:21.505 --> 37:25.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here we have a family who
clearly could
be the target of this.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

37:27.511 --> 37:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that clip shows a
nighttime bombing
by the Syrian government, by the
Syrian air

37:33.784 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

37:34.785 --> 37:35.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Assad is just lying.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plenty of politicians do, and
he's one of
them.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
interesting things,
there's also a little map that
you have throughout

37:40.992 --> 37:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this film about how massive this
tiny country,
this tiny war has gotten,
meaning how many

37:47.198 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other global partners or parties
are involved
in this.

37:50.801 --> 37:52.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just the reason.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have proxies in
Russia and the
United States involved, but you
also have

37:55.373 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so many countries around it that
are involved
now.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, wars a little like
tumors.

38:01.178 --> 38:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, they sort of like
drawn draw in
more and more blood supply, and
they grow.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so there's arms going in.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's oil coming out.

38:08.319 --> 38:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's antiquities coming out.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's people coming out.

38:11.155 --> 38:12.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's jihadis going in.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's the whole ecosystem.

38:14.392 --> 38:19.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And even on the sort of
diplomatic level,
on the sort of national level,
there are a

38:19.764 --> 38:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good dozen countries that are
directly involved
in the mechanics of that war,
and some very,

38:26.070 --> 38:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very powerful players in the
world.

38:27.805 --> 38:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's like a bar fight that,
you know,
the longer it goes on, the more
people are

38:32.576 --> 38:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved, until everyone is
fighting, and
one of the rationales for
stepping in early

38:36.013 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trying to stop these civil
wars before
they get this kind of critical
mass.

38:40.284 --> 38:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
stepping in
early or later, one of the
things that you

38:44.188 --> 38:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point out is that there's a
legacy that goes
all the way back, perhaps, to
the de-Baathification

38:48.426 --> 38:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iraq and how that contributed
to what is
happening in Syria.

38:51.696 --> 38:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also you take a fairly
pointed look at
President Obama and the red line
and the United

38:58.336 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States' inability to do anything
after that
red line was crossed.

39:01.372 --> 39:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Oh, there are
huge missteps
by the United States, the
invasion of Iraq

39:07.445 --> 39:09.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arguably being one of them.

39:09.647 --> 39:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After we invaded Iraq, the
de-Baathification
put on the street tens of
thousands of Baath

39:17.121 --> 39:22.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party members who weren't
necessarily loyalists,
but they were sort of expelled
from government,

39:22.460 --> 39:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expelled from the military,
expelled from
their jobs.

39:26.130 --> 39:30.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we helped install a
Shia government
in Baghdad that really starting
preying on

39:30.501 --> 39:33.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these people, killing them.

39:33.571 --> 39:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so of course those people
saw ISIS as
-- ISIS presented themselves as
their protectors.

39:42.146 --> 39:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, of course,
that -- you know,
that worked quite well for ISIS.

39:47.017 --> 39:51.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And had that not happened --
and, you know,
this analysis comes from
American generals.

39:51.322 --> 39:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't some sort of far-out
left-wing
analysis.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are American generals
looking back at
the war in Iraq and thinking, my
God, was

39:57.261 --> 39:59.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that a mistake.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the ripple
effects now
it has even going all the way up
into Europe

40:02.299 --> 40:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and even political repercussions
of the migrant
influx into Europe.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

40:08.672 --> 40:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the modern world, and maybe
even the ancient
world, you really can't say that
someone else's

40:12.543 --> 40:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problems aren't your problems.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will eventually reach you.

40:16.013 --> 40:17.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My first war was Bosnia.

40:17.782 --> 40:21.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a war that a lot of
people sort of
ignored, but it started just
pumping millions

40:21.986 --> 40:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of refugees out of Eastern
Europe into neighboring
countries, and along with that
came a lot

40:27.191 --> 40:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of problems, including organized
crime into
allied countries, countries that
we're allied

40:33.264 --> 40:34.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

40:34.632 --> 40:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, eventually, President
Clinton stepped
in and put a stop to it.

40:37.968 --> 40:39.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there are real consequences.

40:39.904 --> 40:46.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Syria, it's a sort of
cauldron of an
awful lot of things that will
affect us, refugees,

40:46.110 --> 40:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism, and a huge nexus of
sort of illegal
activity, arms sales, drugs,
antiquities.

40:54.685 --> 41:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And wars are not something you
want happening
in the world, and they will
affect everybody,

41:00.291 --> 41:01.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including people in the United
States.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think people don't quite
understand that.

41:03.627 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sebastian
Junger, thanks
for joining us.

41:11.068 --> 41:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

41:14.805 --> 41:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has long said
he wants to build a hardened
wall across the

41:20.377 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S.-Mexico border to reduce the
flow of drugs
and illegal immigration.

41:25.449 --> 41:31.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what would a continuous wall
from California
to Texas mean for wildlife in
the area?

41:31.789 --> 41:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham is back again
with a report
from Arizona.

41:34.258 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is part of our weekly series
examining
the leading edge of science.

41:39.196 --> 41:44.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tens of
thousands of migrants
risk their lives each year
crossing this dangerous,

41:44.168 --> 41:46.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remote desert between the U.S.
and Mexico.

41:46.871 --> 41:51.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have found creative ways to
get over
or around the steel fences built
to keep them

41:51.809 --> 41:53.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

41:53.511 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of the wild plants and
animals here
in the Sonoran Desert can't do
that.

41:57.548 --> 42:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These miles of fencing divide
their natural
habitat and threaten their
survival.

42:02.553 --> 42:08.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 50 species near the
border are already
endangered, like the Sonoran
pronghorn, the

42:08.359 --> 42:10.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gray wolf and the ocelot.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS,
Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum: Nature has no borders.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nature knows no political
boundaries.

42:15.199 --> 42:20.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sergio
Avila-Villegas is
a wildlife biologist with the
Arizona-Sonora

42:20.037 --> 42:22.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Desert Museum in Tucson.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's spent the last 16 years
studying this
area.

42:25.943 --> 42:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took us to the Coronado
National Memorial
in the Huachuca Mountains on the
Arizona-Mexico

42:31.048 --> 42:32.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

42:32.816 --> 42:35.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the border fence -- you
can see it
there in the distance -- means
animals have

42:35.719 --> 42:40.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to range farther afield to find
food, water
and mates.

42:40.491 --> 42:45.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this one, what seems to
my eye a very
thin fence that runs across the
border, but

42:45.229 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're saying this really does
have a major
impact on the species that live
here?

42:49.366 --> 42:53.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: From a
sparrow perspective,
from a grasshopper perspective,
and from even

42:53.871 --> 43:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plant perspective, this is a
very difficult
thing to overcome, and this
blocks reproduction

43:00.344 --> 43:02.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of plants and animals.

43:02.146 --> 43:06.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one study
from 2011,
biologists found border fences
increased the

43:06.850 --> 43:12.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk of population decline and
extinction,
especially for endangered
species.

43:12.523 --> 43:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another study from the same year
found border
security infrastructure could
interfere with

43:16.927 --> 43:18.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
black bear breeding.

43:18.896 --> 43:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the border fence between
the U.S. and
Mexico went up about 10 years
ago, conservationists

43:23.634 --> 43:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried to stop it, but ultimately
lost that
fight.

43:27.104 --> 43:31.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighty percent of Arizona's
border with Mexico
has some kind of barrier.

43:31.609 --> 43:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gaps do occasionally exist where
wildlife
can pass, but finding those
places isn't easy.

43:36.513 --> 43:39.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I would build a great wall.

43:39.083 --> 43:43.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now that
President Trump
plans to build what may be a
continuous wall

43:43.087 --> 43:49.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from California to Texas,
Avila-Villegas and
other scientists worry this will
only accelerate

43:49.193 --> 43:51.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the extinction of some animals.

43:51.228 --> 43:55.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS:
Long-term, this could
be a division of genetical
populations, where

43:55.332 --> 44:00.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a group of animals from one side
cannot reproduce
with another group of animals,
breaking the

44:00.704 --> 44:02.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
connectivity, creating some
genetical problems.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The survival of the species is
at risk.

44:05.376 --> 44:09.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Species like
this jaguar,
which was spotted several times
in Arizona

44:09.647 --> 44:11.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last few years.

44:11.515 --> 44:16.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, these jaguars
roamed from the
Southwest United States down
through the Amazon

44:16.620 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Basin, all the way to Argentina.

44:19.423 --> 44:24.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists estimate this big cat
now occupies
less than half of its original
range because

44:24.294 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of habitat loss and poaching.

44:26.530 --> 44:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There may be fewer than 50,000
breeding adults
left.

44:29.400 --> 44:33.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: If
there's an impermeable
barrier, we are losing the
opportunity to

44:33.771 --> 44:39.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the third largest cat in
the world to
recover its populations in the
United States.

44:39.476 --> 44:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jaguars deserve an opportunity
to live in
this place too.

44:41.845 --> 44:46.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Coronado
National Memorial
is considered a critical habitat
zone, meaning

44:46.850 --> 44:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would normally be protected
by the Endangered
Species Act.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Congress wanted the fence
built quickly.

44:52.756 --> 44:58.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2005, it allowed the
Department of Homeland
Security to bypass all
environmental laws

44:58.562 --> 45:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during construction, including
the requirement
to study what this fence would
do to wildlife.

45:04.868 --> 45:09.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Congressman Rob Bishop,
Republican from Utah,
thinks those exemptions aren't
enough.

45:09.373 --> 45:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's introduced legislation that
would extend
those legal waivers to Border
Patrol agents,

45:13.677 --> 45:15.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who do have to obey
environmental laws.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

45:17.548 --> 45:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB BISHOP (R), Utah: So,
everything from
California to Texas is almost
all federal

45:21.151 --> 45:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
property, and over half of that
is in a wilderness
designation, which has specific
requirements

45:26.356 --> 45:28.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for what can and cannot be done.

45:28.192 --> 45:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where the Border Patrol
is prohibited
from doing their job, and that's
the mistake,

45:32.496 --> 45:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because that becomes the avenue
for most of
the illegal entrants into this
country.

45:37.968 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it has a direct
correlation to
the amount of federal land and
the amount

45:41.238 --> 45:45.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of restrictions the Border
Patrol has on how
they can do their jobs on that
corridor.

45:45.476 --> 45:49.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Border Patrol
can't build
bases, towers, or roads without
permission

45:49.947 --> 45:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from other federal agencies,
like the Fish
and Wildlife Service.

45:53.450 --> 45:58.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also not allowed to
drive over protected
lands, a rule smugglers don't
have to follow.

45:58.055 --> 46:01.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL, Environmental
Attorney: We have
one of the largest wilderness
areas in a national

46:01.425 --> 46:06.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wildlife refuge in Southern
Arizona, and Border
Patrol has been driving over it
for close

46:06.697 --> 46:08.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to a decade.

46:08.565 --> 46:11.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cyndi Tuell is
an environmental
lawyer and border lands
conservation advocate

46:11.935 --> 46:16.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who says she's seen Border
Patrol in places
they're not supposed to be.

46:16.039 --> 46:21.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL: The main focus of
my work as
a conservation attorney is to
try to get Border

46:21.545 --> 46:24.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patrol, Department of Homeland
Security to
follow the law.

46:24.414 --> 46:28.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they're one of the largest
law enforcement
agencies in the country, they
very much need

46:28.619 --> 46:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be complying with the law
themselves.

46:30.487 --> 46:34.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She spends
part of her time
travelling the backcountry,
looking for signs

46:34.091 --> 46:36.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Border Patrol's impact on
public lands.

46:36.527 --> 46:42.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says their vehicles can
crush vegetation
and erode soil, and that habitat
is destroyed

46:42.065 --> 46:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when they build bases and
surveillance towers.

46:44.401 --> 46:48.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL: Every time I'm out
here, though,
I interact with a Border Patrol
agent, or

46:48.972 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I see the signs of
militarization.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I see tanks.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see heavily armed men.

46:55.946 --> 47:01.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see vehicle tracks two or
three miles into
a wilderness area that I know
shouldn't be

47:01.385 --> 47:03.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

47:03.153 --> 47:04.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE, Former
Commissioner, U.S.
Customs and Border Protection:
Customs and

47:04.855 --> 47:08.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Border Protection has to be able
to be on
the borders, whether it's in
environmentally

47:08.492 --> 47:10.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sensitive land or not.

47:10.427 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gil
Kerlikowske served as
the commissioner for customs and
border protection

47:14.531 --> 47:18.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from 2014 until the new
administration took
over.

47:18.202 --> 47:20.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now a fellow at Harvard
University.

47:20.070 --> 47:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE: I think it's
very difficult
for those agents and their
vehicles and other

47:24.808 --> 47:30.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
types of equipment to be in an
area and not
to leave some type of footprint.

47:30.214 --> 47:36.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would mention that, as
often as hard
as they work to try and reduce
their environmental

47:36.653 --> 47:41.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact, I think there's always
going to be,
as a result of that human
intervention, some

47:41.458 --> 47:44.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
type of an effect on the
environment.

47:44.928 --> 47:49.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: The
infrastructure
seems to be a
one-solution-fits-all for many

47:49.066 --> 47:53.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different problems, and I don't
think it's
addressing the root causes.

47:53.470 --> 47:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really think that the
environment is
paying the ultimate price for
this.

47:57.007 --> 48:02.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Have you and
the conservation
community made those concerns
known to the

48:02.412 --> 48:04.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Border Patrol and the Customs
and Border Protection?

48:04.181 --> 48:08.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: A lot of
our concerns
have been voiced through the
conservation

48:08.051 --> 48:11.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and science community to the
Department of
Homeland Security.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't go anywhere.

48:13.457 --> 48:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Border Patrol and the
Department of Homeland
Security have no mandate to
listen to these

48:20.063 --> 48:21.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concerns.

48:21.832 --> 48:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We asked the
Department
of Homeland Security if they
have required

48:23.634 --> 48:28.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any passageways for wildlife in
the solicitations
they have put out to contractors
who want

48:28.505 --> 48:30.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to build the new wall.

48:30.507 --> 48:34.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have told us that the
current plans -- quote
-- "will not result in
significant environmental

48:34.912 --> 48:36.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
impacts.

48:36.480 --> 48:41.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, for this particular
project,
DHS is not planning for
mitigation."

48:41.385 --> 48:46.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump ordered 5,000
more agents
be hired and deployed along the
border, and

48:46.690 --> 48:49.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plans for his wall are now being
drafted.

48:49.293 --> 48:54.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The few wildlife corridors that
do remain
could soon be closed for good.

48:54.765 --> 49:04.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Sonoran Desert in
Arizona, I'm William
Brangham for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:04.775 --> 49:16.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight, Hari Sreenivasan
is back with an appreciation of
an Oscar-winning

49:16.553 --> 49:17.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

49:17.554 --> 49:19.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS, Actor: Quid pro
quo.

49:19.323 --> 49:23.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell you things, you tell me
things, not
about this case, though, about
yourself.

49:23.493 --> 49:28.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After years
making B-movies,
Jonathan Demme's first major
commercial success

49:28.799 --> 49:34.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was 1991's "Silence of the
Lambs," and, for
many, would remain his
best-known film.

49:34.604 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dark thriller, based on a
book, followed
Jodie Foster as an FBI field
agent on the

49:39.509 --> 49:44.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hunt for a serial killer, using
the counsel
of a psychopath named Hannibal
Lecter, played

49:44.614 --> 49:45.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by Anthony Hopkins.

49:45.882 --> 49:48.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS: What is your
worst memory
of childhood?

49:48.518 --> 49:51.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JODIE FOSTER, Actress: The death
of my father.

49:51.755 --> 49:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS: Tell me about
it, and don't
lie, or I will know.

49:56.760 --> 50:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JODIE FOSTER: He was a town
marshal, and one
night, he surprised two burglars
coming out

50:04.701 --> 50:06.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the back of a drugstore.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They shot him.

50:08.372 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It earned
Demme the Academy
Award for best director.

50:12.175 --> 50:14.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEVIN COSTNER, Actor: To
Jonathan Demme for
"Silence of the Lambs."

50:14.911 --> 50:16.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:16.513 --> 50:18.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it remains
the only
horror film to ever win for best
picture.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN DEMME, Director: Hi,
mom.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thanks for transferring your
love of movies
to me.

50:22.819 --> 50:26.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks, dad, for making me
think I could
actually be part of this
industry.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And thank you.

50:29.359 --> 50:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mike Sargent
is a film critic
for Pacifica Radio.

50:32.162 --> 50:35.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
At the time, a thriller and
horror were kind

50:35.532 --> 50:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of seen to be the same thing.

50:37.267 --> 50:41.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a movie about a serial
killer is not the
kind of movie that really gets
acclaim.

50:41.638 --> 50:47.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he took something that
could've been considered
pulpy, and really turned it into
high art.

50:47.644 --> 50:49.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He really elevated the form.

50:49.146 --> 50:51.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Demme did
more than
crime thrillers.

50:52.015 --> 51:05.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over his career, he made indie
films, dramas,
documentaries, comedies and
concert movies,

51:05.095 --> 51:18.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too, including 1984's "Stop
Making Sense,"
a stylized look at the band the
Talking Heads.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENZEL WASHINGTON, Actor: So,
you were concealing
your illness.

51:20.911 --> 51:25.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In 1993, Demme
directed
"Philadelphia," one of the first
major Hollywood

51:25.449 --> 51:28.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
films to confront the HIV/AIDS
crisis.

51:28.385 --> 51:32.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It starred Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks,
who won an Oscar for his
portrayal of a gay

51:32.722 --> 51:34.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lawyer infected with HIV.

51:34.658 --> 51:38.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENZEL WASHINGTON: Didn't you
have an obligation
to tell your employer you had
this dreaded,

51:38.195 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deadly, infectious disease?

51:39.329 --> 51:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM HANKS, Actor: That's not the
point.

51:43.133 --> 51:48.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the day they hired me to
the day I was
fired, I served my clients
consistently, thoroughly,

51:48.738 --> 51:49.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with absolute excellence.

51:50.006 --> 51:51.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they hadn't fired me, that's
what I would
be doing today.

51:51.842 --> 51:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years
later, Demme
directed the adaptation of Toni
Morrison's

51:55.612 --> 51:57.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
novel "Beloved," starring Oprah
Winfrey.

51:57.914 --> 52:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OPRAH WINFREY, Actress: Could
stay the night,
if you had a mind to.

52:00.617 --> 52:02.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANNY GLOVER, Actor: You don't
sound too steady
in the offer.

52:02.919 --> 52:04.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OPRAH WINFREY: Oh, it's truly
meant.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just I hope you will pardon
my house.

52:05.655 --> 52:06.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANNY GLOVER: "My house."

52:06.656 --> 52:11.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I like the sound of that.

52:11.495 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: He was definitely
someone who
I think was sensitive to issues
of race and

52:21.204 --> 52:22.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sexuality and things like that.

52:22.873 --> 52:24.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM HANKS: What I loved the most
about the
law?

52:24.975 --> 52:26.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DENZEL WASHINGTON: Yes.

52:26.743 --> 52:36.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HANKS: Is that every now and
again, not
often, but occasionally, you get
to be a part

52:36.820 --> 52:40.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of justice being done.

52:40.323 --> 52:45.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: I think he stacks
up there in
