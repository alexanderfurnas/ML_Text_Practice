JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.933 --> 00:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
health care legislation in
critical condition again.

00:11.733 --> 00:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican senators struggle
to muster enough votes to pass
even a slimmed-down reform bill.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the White House is busy with
its own battles, as backlash
heats up over the president's

00:24.233 --> 00:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call to ban transgender people
from serving in the military
and the public fallout with

00:28.833 --> 00:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his own attorney general.

00:30.333 --> 00:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then: stuck between
a rock and a visa.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the nation's top vacation
spots struggles to get seasonal
employees as immigration rules

00:40.266 --> 00:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
become more restrictive.

00:42.766 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY, Owner, Lobster
Pot: It's impossible to
run a business when you
don't know if you're

00:45.800 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting 43 of your 96 people.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The rest of them
are all Americans.

00:51.366 --> 00:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This year, we were
open six weeks late.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Next year, we may
not open at all.

00:56.433 --> 01:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:04.133 --> 01:07.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.033 --> 01:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
efforts to pass health
care reform ran into
even more roadblocks

01:16.500 --> 01:19.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this evening.

01:19.033 --> 01:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A group of key senators
balked at voting for
what some have called the
last resort, a version

01:23.233 --> 01:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
labeled skinny repeal.

01:25.266 --> 01:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This came as plans were
laid for debate and maybe
a final vote later tonight.

01:29.933 --> 01:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:33.666 --> 01:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A long day
of debate setting up a longer
night of votes, with Republicans

01:42.066 --> 01:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stressing the
failures of Obamacare.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAMAR ALEXANDER (R),
Tennessee: Conditions
have changed in Tennessee.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our insurance market is --
quote -- "very near collapse."

01:53.400 --> 01:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that up to 350,000
individuals in our state,
songwriters, workers, farmers,

01:58.866 --> 02:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who buy their insurance on
individual market are sitting
there worrying in July and in

02:04.800 --> 02:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
August whether they
will have any option to
buy insurance in 2018.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Democrats
insisting that Republicans'
plans could mean no choices,

02:15.966 --> 02:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
especially for the poor.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:18.566 --> 02:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Where there is a serious
disagreement is, we say that the

02:21.433 --> 02:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children of this country who
have serious illnesses have
the freedom to stay alive,

02:27.633 --> 02:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even if their parents do
not have a lot of money.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The debate
all leading lead up to a
whirlwind called vote-a-rama.

02:37.466 --> 02:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senators will take up amendment
after amendment with little
debate and five-minute votes.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All or nearly all
are expected to fail.

02:44.533 --> 02:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, at the end of the
legislative marathon,
comes the key moment.

02:49.433 --> 02:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans plan to propose the
one idea they think could pass
now: a stripped-down, minimal

02:55.766 --> 02:58.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
repeal.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would abolish Obamacare's
individual and employer
mandates, as well as
one tax on medical

03:02.400 --> 03:04.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
devices.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would leave Medicaid and much
of the rest of the Affordable
Care Act essentially unchanged.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some on Capitol Hill call
it the skinny repeal,
but the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office

03:15.533 --> 03:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
found it would mean 15
million fewer Americans
with health insurance.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is another issue:
The CBO also found the idea
would save $78 billion.

03:26.366 --> 03:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to comply with special rules
that Republicans are using,
this plan would need to save at

03:30.100 --> 03:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
least $133 billion, the score
for the original House bill.

03:38.433 --> 03:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the votes stack up, so has
more White House pushback at
Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski,

03:44.600 --> 03:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who voted against
starting debate.

03:47.233 --> 03:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First reported by Alaska
Dispatch News, Murkowski,
along with fellow Alaskan
Senator Dan Sullivan,

03:53.233 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
received grave phone calls
from President Trump's
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

03:56.666 --> 04:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He warned that the no vote
put Alaska's future with the
administration in jeopardy.

04:03.566 --> 04:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The paper speculated
jeopardy meant problems for
Alaska's energy concerns.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Murkowski is
standing her ground.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA MURKOWSKI (R), Alaska:
I'm a pretty strong and
independent individual.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime, as
to the endgame, Republicans
admit, if they pass a bill, it

04:21.266 --> 04:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be a placeholder to
negotiate with the House.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:24.666 --> 04:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAMAR ALEXANDER: It is not
a solution to Affordable
Care Act problems.

04:27.266 --> 04:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is its a solution
to how we get to a place
where we can write a
solution to the Affordable

04:33.766 --> 04:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Care Act problems.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime,
Democrats predict a last-minute
bill would backfire.

04:38.066 --> 04:40.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:40.066 --> 04:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington:
If they jam it through, they
will be held accountable

04:42.933 --> 04:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the millions of people
who lose care and the millions
and millions more who will see

04:48.666 --> 04:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their premiums go up.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Everyone
on both sides is looking
at a long night.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY (R), Louisiana:
You can sleep out in the
hall in between votes.

04:59.233 --> 05:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, late
today, what we were suggesting
as we introduced your piece

05:06.466 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is you had a group of
Republicans coming out
and saying they're not
even prepared to vote

05:13.400 --> 05:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this so-called skinny
repeal, which many had thought
was going to be the last resort.

05:18.966 --> 05:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a late
and rather potentially pivotal
twist led by Senator Lindsey

05:23.033 --> 05:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Graham of South Carolina.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, John McCain was
standing there, as well as
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

05:28.366 --> 05:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All three of those senators
said they will not vote for
that so-called skinny repeal

05:32.733 --> 05:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or that smaller repeal bill
unless they are guaranteed
that that is not the end, that

05:40.200 --> 05:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are guaranteed that
the chance to debate a
larger bill what's called
conference committee

05:42.966 --> 05:43.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the House.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's critical.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that we won't see the
health care end -- the health
care debate end this weekend,

05:48.800 --> 05:50.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as some people were
starting to talk about.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, how did
they get to the point where
right here at the -- beyond the

05:55.433 --> 06:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
11th hour, you still
have Republican senators
saying they're not
comfortable with the options

06:01.500 --> 06:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're being offered?

06:04.066 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
there is a graduate-level
class and probably
several in the works that

06:07.066 --> 06:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will look at that
exact question, Judy.

06:09.166 --> 06:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, from my viewpoint, one of
the issues here was that they
didn't go through the usual

06:13.100 --> 06:14.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

06:14.266 --> 06:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't go
through committees.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't have
public discussion.

06:16.733 --> 06:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They did not have
drafts of this bill.

06:18.766 --> 06:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, Judy, as I talk
to you right now, there is
still no draft of what could

06:21.800 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be the final proposal
before senators.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to Ron Johnson, who
said he wants to improve this
bill, along with those other

06:28.266 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators, to give more money
to states in block grants.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, when will your
amendment be drafted?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "We can't draft
it now because we don't
know what we're amending."

06:36.733 --> 06:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the process itself
has led to these large questions
here near the very end.

06:43.666 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When are the
arguments, Lisa, that are mainly
being used by the Republican

06:46.366 --> 06:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leadership, and for that
matter by the White House?

06:49.233 --> 06:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they have any presence
as this moves closer to an
attempt to pass something?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vice
President Pence has certainly
been an important factor.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was here today speaking
to small business owners.

07:00.166 --> 07:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have not seen him on
the Senate side today,
but I understand he
has been making phone

07:04.066 --> 07:05.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calls.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think the basic gist of
this, Judy, is rather simple.

07:08.433 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican leaders in the
Senate seem to be saying,
vote for this or nothing.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is your one shot.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, they were
saying, we will add to it,
we will improve it later.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But late today, they seemed
to be saying, we actually
could pass this with the House

07:20.066 --> 07:21.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this weekend.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's another important
development to watch, Judy.

07:23.700 --> 07:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House has now signaled to
its members that they should
be ready to stay this weekend,

07:27.900 --> 07:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are preparing a rule
that would allow them to pass
anything, including a health

07:31.500 --> 07:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care bill, same day.

07:33.533 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if the Senate passes
something, the House could
pass it very quickly.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just like on the Senate,
it's not clear that the House
Republican Conference supports

07:41.400 --> 07:43.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any one vehicle.

07:43.566 --> 07:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very complicated, and right
now, it seems the last hour has
not worked to the leadership's

07:48.266 --> 07:50.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advantage.

07:50.266 --> 07:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we sit
here or stand here, or you stand
there, Lisa, as the evening

07:53.733 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets under way, you're saying
this is truly up in the air?

07:57.466 --> 07:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

07:58.466 --> 07:59.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It is.

07:59.666 --> 08:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it will
be a long night.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that vote-a-rama that
we explained, right now, the
timing of that is on hold.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know this, Judy.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of people
have ordered pizza.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have brought my toothbrush.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My husband doesn't know that
yet, but I think we just don't
know what's going to happen,

08:11.833 --> 08:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it will be an
important next 24 hours.

08:13.766 --> 08:15.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:15.166 --> 08:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Toothbrush
better than pizza.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa, thank you.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And good luck
staying up all night.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
have heard, we keep talking
about so-called skinny repeal.

08:23.266 --> 08:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at exactly
what that means.

08:24.866 --> 08:26.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, for that, we
bring in Sarah Kliff.

08:26.666 --> 08:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She is a senior policy
correspondent for
the Web site Vox.

08:30.366 --> 08:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has written
extensively on health care.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the program.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF, Vox: Thank you.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah, so we
are throwing around this term.

08:38.300 --> 08:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we heard from Lisa, there
are senators who are saying
even this may not be acceptable

08:42.666 --> 08:45.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for purposes of
conversation, it is
going to be one of the
measures, we think, on the

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it mean?

08:51.100 --> 08:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: So, it basically
means repealing the individual
mandate, this requirement to

08:53.166 --> 08:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
purchase health coverage.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen other parts come
in, come out, the medical
device tax, defunding Planned

08:57.866 --> 09:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parenthood, but, at the
core, it's the repeal
of the requirement to
purchase health coverage.

09:01.566 --> 09:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's
rolling back some of Obamacare,
some of the Affordable Care

09:06.233 --> 09:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Act, but not as much as
full-blown repeal would be?

09:09.666 --> 09:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: It's certainly
not as much, so compared to
the other bills, the one that

09:12.800 --> 09:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passed through the House, for
example, the American Health
Care Act, which would get

09:15.700 --> 09:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rid of much more in the health
care law, the essential health
benefits, for example, this

09:20.133 --> 09:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is smaller, but it would
affect a lot of people.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and that's
what I want to ask you about,
because you wrote a piece

09:25.066 --> 09:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for Vox today which was
titled "Skinny Repeal
Isn't Skinny at All."

09:29.200 --> 09:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes, this is
a bill would cause about 15
million people to lose coverage.

09:33.400 --> 09:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I kind of say skinny repeal
is a misnomer, that this would
really change the individual

09:38.866 --> 09:40.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

09:40.866 --> 09:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Medicaid expansion, that
would mostly function the same,
but for people who purchase

09:43.233 --> 09:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage in the individual
market, they could expect
premium increases of 20 percent.

09:47.866 --> 09:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of people would
drop out of the market.

09:49.833 --> 09:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think most
Americans would see that
as a skinny, small change.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
things you were writing about
is the integral role that the

09:57.433 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individual mandate
plays in all this.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Remind us why that
matters so much.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: That's a
requirement that nearly
all of us in the United
States have to purchase

10:04.900 --> 10:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health insurance.

10:06.933 --> 10:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the draft version of the
Affordable Care Act, they
knew that was unpopular.

10:09.566 --> 10:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They included it because
they needed a way to
get healthy people into
the insurance market.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't have mandate,
the fear is that only the sick
people who really need coverage

10:17.333 --> 10:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sign up, premiums get really
high, you could enter a death
spiral, where premiums just

10:21.566 --> 10:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go higher and higher.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even Republican senators
agree on this point, that
the mandate, it is what makes

10:27.000 --> 10:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the market work.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It gets the healthy
people to sign up.

10:30.233 --> 10:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that explains
the number you gave at the
beginning of our conversation,

10:35.366 --> 10:37.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 15 million.

10:37.466 --> 10:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The larger repeal would
have meant 24, 25 million
people losing coverage.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're saying even
this is 15, 16 million.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes, the big
difference is Medicaid.

10:47.066 --> 10:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those other bills,
they would have ended
Medicaid expansion,
would have had much, much

10:50.033 --> 10:52.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
more significant
Medicaid losses.

10:52.633 --> 10:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are actually some
Medicaid losses associated with
individual mandate repeals.

10:57.266 --> 11:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO thinks that, if
there isn't a mandate,
if people don't hear this
message health insurance

11:01.600 --> 11:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is mandatory in the United
States, they might not
sign up for Medicaid.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the real challenge here
is in the individual markets.

11:07.333 --> 11:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it does
sound like, with this, as we
said, late-day news conference,

11:12.066 --> 11:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lindsey Graham, other
Republicans coming out and
saying, we're not prepared

11:16.133 --> 11:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to support this unless we know
the House is going to work
with us on this, indicates that

11:20.366 --> 11:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're getting some
of this message.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes,
they understand.

11:23.700 --> 11:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey Graham was saying, you
know, in his press conference,
we don't think this is good

11:27.100 --> 11:29.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't think it's good to
take the individual mandate
out of the marketplace.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they recognize
these consequences.

11:33.466 --> 11:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Kliff
with Vox watching it all very
closely, thank you so much.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Thank you.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will
be turning to Republican
Senator James Lankford
for his insights right

11:45.266 --> 11:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

11:47.433 --> 11:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
The U.S. military's top
commander said there
will not be any changes

11:51.666 --> 11:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regarding transgender
troops for now.

11:54.700 --> 11:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump tweeted
yesterday that he's reinstating
the ban on transgender service

11:59.633 --> 12:01.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

12:01.666 --> 12:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, in an internal memo,
Marine General and Joint Chiefs
Chairman Joe Dunford said

12:05.466 --> 12:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that pending actual direction
-- quote -- "We will continue
to treat all our personnel with

12:11.366 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respect."

12:13.333 --> 12:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Army's chief of staff,
General Mark Milley, echoed
that in a Washington appearance.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MILLEY, U.S. Army Chief
of Staff: We grow up and learn
to obey the chain of command.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my chain of command is the
secretary of the Army and the
secretary of defense, right,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the president.

12:26.933 --> 12:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we will work through the
implementation guidance when
we get it, and then we will

12:32.733 --> 12:34.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
move from there.

12:34.700 --> 12:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis has been on
vacation, and has made no public

12:38.366 --> 12:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comment on reinstating the ban.

12:40.866 --> 12:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. House of
Representatives has
approved $1.6 billion for
President Trump's proposed

12:46.533 --> 12:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wall on the Mexican border.

12:48.266 --> 12:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the amount he
formally asked for in May.

12:51.333 --> 12:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vote today attached the
money to a much larger bill
that includes a major increase

12:55.733 --> 12:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in defense spending.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That now goes to the Senate.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A top Senate Republican had
sharp words for the president
today over Attorney General

13:03.800 --> 13:05.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeff Sessions.

13:05.933 --> 13:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump has repeatedly
attacked Sessions for
recusing himself in the
Russia investigation.

13:12.566 --> 13:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Senator Lindsey
Graham, who we have been
hearing about, warned that
there will be -- quote

13:14.200 --> 13:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - "holy hell" to pay
if Sessions is fired.

13:18.033 --> 13:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He also warned against
getting rid of special
counsel Bob Mueller.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Any effort to go after
Mueller could be the beginning

13:25.600 --> 13:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the end of the Trump
presidency, unless Mueller
did something wrong.

13:29.966 --> 13:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Right now, I have no
reason to believe that
Mueller is compromised.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you got reason to believe
he is compromised and shouldn't
be serving as special counsel,

13:39.400 --> 13:41.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let me know.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaker of the
House Paul Ryan also said that
Mueller should stay where he

13:44.533 --> 13:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is and continue doing his job.

13:47.533 --> 13:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Attorney General Sessions was
traveling in El Salvador today.

13:50.833 --> 13:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said again he will serve
as long as the president wants
him to, but he acknowledged

13:55.133 --> 13:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it hasn't been -- quote
-- "the best week."

13:57.966 --> 14:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. State Department is
condemning Iran's claim that
it launched an advanced rocket

14:02.233 --> 14:03.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into space.

14:03.933 --> 14:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The announcement today
said it happened at a
site east of Tehran.

14:07.633 --> 14:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State TV said the rocket
could carry a satellite
weighing about 550 pounds.

14:11.500 --> 14:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. says it could lead
to long-range missiles, and
violates the spirit of the Iran

14:17.833 --> 14:19.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear accord.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clashes erupted today between
Palestinians and Israeli
police near a Jerusalem mosque.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands rushed to pray there
after Israel finished removing
security devices that had

14:31.266 --> 14:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
triggered a boycott.

14:33.366 --> 14:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians threw stones and
Israeli police fired back with
tear gas and stun grenades.

14:38.866 --> 14:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Red Crescent said
that 37 people were hurt.

14:41.633 --> 14:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Each side blamed the
other for the trouble.

Back in this country,
investigators are asking
why a ride at the Ohio
State Fair broke apart

14:50.366 --> 14:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wednesday evening and
killed a teenager.

14:53.033 --> 14:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Two others were critically hurt.

14:55.133 --> 15:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This cell phone video, slowed
down, captured part of the
Fire Ball ride giving way, just

15:01.300 --> 15:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before it hurled
people to the ground.

15:03.766 --> 15:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The fair opened as
scheduled today, but all
rides were shut down.

15:08.266 --> 15:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Governor John Kasich promised
complete inspections.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN KASICH (R), Ohio: I
think about those people
that were hit by debris.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think about that moment
when some were thrown
from that carriage.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a nightmare.

15:22.233 --> 15:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a terrible situation.

15:25.233 --> 15:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all we can do is what is
humanly possible to make sure
that we provide the safety and

15:31.433 --> 15:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the inspections.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: State
inspectors had checked the
ride before it began operating.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now officials in several other
states are saying they have
shut down these Fire Ball

15:42.233 --> 15:44.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rides as well.

religious freedom.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House announced
the appointment last night.

15:53.233 --> 15:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican's popularity
has plummeted over steep tax
cuts that led to severe budget

15:58.933 --> 16:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
problems in Kansas.

16:01.566 --> 16:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But conservative religious
groups pushed Brownback's
nomination, for his
opposition to abortion

16:06.100 --> 16:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to same-sex marriage.

A court in China has handed a
first-of-its-kind victory to
that country's LGBT community.

The verdict today sided
with a man who said that
he was fired from his job
for being transgender.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court ruled that workers

today for President
Trump's speech this week

16:33.500 --> 16:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the Scouts'
national jamboree.

16:36.033 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Surbaugh said,
in an open letter --
quote - - "We sincerely
regret that politics were

16:41.666 --> 16:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inserted into the
scouting program."

16:44.033 --> 16:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president appeared
Monday night before
thousands of Scouts,
visitors and staff convened

16:48.900 --> 16:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in West Virginia.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He laced his speech with a
series of partisan attacks.

16:54.500 --> 16:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And today on Wall Street,
tech stocks slumped, but the
blue chips set a new record.

17:01.133 --> 17:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 85 points
to close at 21796.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 40 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

17:09.933 --> 17:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a key senator in the middle
of the contentious health care

17:16.900 --> 17:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate; a shortage of seasonal
workers at one of the nation's
top vacation spots; the

17:21.533 --> 17:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feuds dividing the White House
and the Capitol; and much more.

17:35.766 --> 17:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Back to health care now.

17:36.966 --> 17:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At this hour, its fate
remains uncertain.

17:40.566 --> 17:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans have not been
able to muster enough support
among their own ranks.

17:44.166 --> 17:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to one of them, Senator
James Lankford of Oklahoma,
just shortly before four of his

17:51.133 --> 17:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleagues said that they'd
vote no without assurances from
the House of Representatives.

17:54.733 --> 17:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking the senator
if he thinks any version of
the health care bill will pass.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:01.466 --> 18:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R), Oklahoma:
I do actually, but I don't
think it's the final version.

18:03.466 --> 18:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have is the House
will have version, the
Senate will have a version.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neither of us want it to be the
final version at this point.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will go to a conference
committee, and we will work
out the differences, and there

18:12.066 --> 18:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be significant differences
between the House and Senate,
and then bring a final version

18:15.533 --> 18:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out after CBO can score
it sometime in September.

18:18.766 --> 18:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, CBO has taken about
four weeks to score
just about everything
we put out, so we have

18:23.533 --> 18:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to be able to give them a
lot more time again to be able
to run through scoring, and

18:27.633 --> 18:29.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then we will be able to
have that final vote.

18:29.700 --> 18:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this week and the next
24 hours is a step again, but
definitely not the final step.

18:33.766 --> 18:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in terms
that voters, that a layman
could understand, what is mainly

18:40.766 --> 18:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this legislation going to
consist of as it comes out
of the Senate, do you think?

18:44.133 --> 18:46.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: So, this
version that will come out, as I
mentioned, is just a step that's

18:47.433 --> 18:49.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming out.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will deal with some basic
things, like the individual
mandate, the employer mandate,

18:52.200 --> 18:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state flexibility in allowing
states to have greater options.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the Affordable Care Act was
passed, it took all the control
of health care to Washington,

18:59.133 --> 19:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.C., away from all the states.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we want to be
able to return some of
that control back, when
prices were much cheaper

19:05.133 --> 19:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the time before, when the
Affordable Care Act was passed.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So those will be
the basic elements.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There will be some other
smaller parts to it.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically the employer
mandate, individual
mandate, and state control
vs. federal control.

19:15.500 --> 19:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, Senator, Democrats and
even a number of Republicans

19:22.500 --> 19:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are saying what's being called
skinny repeal, which is, I
gather, what you're referring

19:25.333 --> 19:26.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to...

19:26.333 --> 19:27.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Right.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... would leave,
what, more than 15 million
Americans without coverage.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other versions would leave many
more millions without coverage.

19:35.533 --> 19:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any one of these versions,
we're told, would raise
the cost of premiums.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you explain a
vote to support that?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:42.866 --> 19:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: So,
again, today's vote
is not the final vote.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand that.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're trying to score
something that's not
finished by any means.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's one big piece of it.

19:50.133 --> 19:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other one is to be able to
look at how CBO scores this.

19:52.266 --> 19:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBO scores -- they basically
assume that if there is not a
mandate to buy it, most people

19:57.033 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't buy the insurance products
that are put out there under
the Affordable Care Act.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, literally, there's
nine million people right
now on the exchanges.

20:04.066 --> 20:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They assume 22 million
people won't have insurance
in the days ahead based
on them changing this.

20:11.066 --> 20:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this may seem odd, and it
only works in an economist's
mind, that only nine million

20:13.366 --> 20:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have it, 22 million
people lose it in that sense.

20:16.366 --> 20:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But here's what's
really going on.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of the mine million people
that are having it, CBO says,
if they're given the choice

20:21.200 --> 20:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to buy it, many of
the individuals don't want to
buy that product, and they only

20:25.166 --> 20:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buy it because they're
forced to buy that product.

20:27.933 --> 20:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's the number
that's sitting out there.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would also say, in my state,
CBO never saw in their original
estimates when the Affordable

20:34.566 --> 20:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act passed that in my
state the insurance rates would
go up over 200 percent for the

20:40.766 --> 20:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individuals that were
buying their insurance.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So CBO is making their best
guess, but I can assure you they
don't always guess correctly.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No one can really see
into the future on that.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're laying out an
economist's view vs. practically
what's actually happening

20:50.733 --> 20:52.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

20:52.866 --> 20:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that hospital officials in
Oklahoma have said if one of

20:55.200 --> 21:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the versions of this were to
pass, that they thought it would
be devastating on their ability

21:00.200 --> 21:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take care of low-income
individuals, whether on
Medicaid or otherwise.

21:04.633 --> 21:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you say to them,
the folks in your own state?

21:07.433 --> 21:08.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes,
same thing, Judy.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, they're looking
at just part of a plan.

21:12.233 --> 21:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that my Democratic
colleagues have been very good
for distributing bits and pieces

21:14.666 --> 21:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of plans and saying here is the
whole plan, without actually
putting the full picture

21:18.133 --> 21:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there for individuals to be
able to see how the stability
works, how aspects of it

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will just put out and
say, this is going to be a cut
that happens to this particular

21:26.933 --> 21:27.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

21:27.933 --> 21:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What will happen?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Immediately, they respond back,
well, that will be dramatic.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me give you a for
instance on Medicaid.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hear a lot of talk about
how Medicaid goes down in
one of the earlier proposals.

21:35.900 --> 21:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid actually increases
every year for the next eight
years in that proposal by twice

21:40.200 --> 21:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rate of inflation, and
then nine years from now it
increases at only the rate of

21:44.900 --> 21:46.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inflation.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's put out by my Democratic
colleagues as a big cut in
Medicaid because nine years

21:50.266 --> 21:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from now it doesn't increase
as fast, but every single
year it's increasing, and for

21:54.833 --> 21:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the next eight years
it increases twice
as fast as inflation.

21:57.333 --> 22:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I want
to change the subject and ask
you about the attorney general,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeff Sessions.

22:03.300 --> 22:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, President Trump
has been publicly criticizing
him for the last several days,

22:09.233 --> 22:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainly because the attorney
general recused himself from
the Russia investigation.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do you make of
the president's public
campaign against him?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it's
something I would never do.

22:19.266 --> 22:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, the president
is the president.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He can lead his staff
however he chooses.

22:22.533 --> 22:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would never say to my
staff in a public setting
that there is a problem.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I have a problem with a
staff member, they will sit
down with me in my office and we

22:27.900 --> 22:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will sit down and work it out.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we can't work it
out, then they will leave.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's something we are
going to work out in private,
not in a public setting.

22:33.933 --> 22:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, quite frankly, Jeff
Sessions had to recuse himself.

22:37.433 --> 22:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something all the legal
counsel in the Department
of Justice, once he joined

22:40.066 --> 22:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the attorney general,
sat down with him, laid
out the law of the statute.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everyone looked at it's.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone read it exactly
the same way, that Jeff
needed to recuse himself.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, did Jeff understand
that before he got there?

22:49.666 --> 22:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No, I don't think he
did, but once he was in
that spot, sitting down
with all the attorneys,

22:53.366 --> 22:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he understand full well
that he had to do that.

22:55.466 --> 22:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that frustrates
the president, but it was
the right thing to do.

22:58.566 --> 23:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would
it mean if the president
were to fire the attorney
general or if Jeff

23:05.966 --> 23:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions were to step down
because of this pressure
from the president?

23:09.133 --> 23:11.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:11.633 --> 23:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, there
would be -- obviously,
the president -- doesn't
have to be just pressure

23:12.433 --> 23:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the president.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president chooses who his
staff is, and they all serve at
the pleasure of the president.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if any point the president
is uncomfortable with Jeff
Sessions and his leadership, he

23:19.833 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can choose to remove him.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what the
president does for that.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's not the issue.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The issue is then going
through the process, going
through all of the nomination.

23:27.633 --> 23:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Getting through all that aspect
again starting all over again
and getting someone in will

23:32.433 --> 23:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take months and months.

23:34.433 --> 23:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the attorney general
is getting a good stride and
dealing with U.S. attorneys

23:37.700 --> 23:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the country, getting
with his staff, getting on board
with different investigations

23:40.866 --> 23:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that need to be done.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I hate to be able to
lose that progress that
is happening right now.

23:44.866 --> 23:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
would it mean for the
Russia investigation
if that were to happen?

23:47.966 --> 23:49.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: It
wouldn't change the Russia
investigation at all.

23:51.833 --> 23:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff is completely disconnected
from what is happening in
the Russia investigation.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's recused himself.

23:56.366 --> 23:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have had numerous
interactions with
people in the DOJ.

23:58.466 --> 24:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not tried to interfere
in that in any way.

24:00.833 --> 24:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's already in the special
counsel's responsibility.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it doesn't change
that investigation at all.

24:05.366 --> 24:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
finally, Senator, the
president's announcement
by Twitter yesterday

24:09.300 --> 24:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to ban individuals
who are transgender from
serving in the military?

24:13.666 --> 24:16.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:16.266 --> 24:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, we're
trying to get additional
details on what he means by
that, the implementation.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the Pentagon
was unaware of an
announcement like that.

24:20.133 --> 24:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon was already in a
six-month review dealing with
transgenders in the military,

24:24.766 --> 24:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what that means as far as
costs, unit cohesion, deployment
capabilities, what that means.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would
you support the ban?

24:30.433 --> 24:32.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, again,
I'm waiting for that six-month
review to come back from the

24:34.300 --> 24:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military officials.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We open up our military to
all aspects for any individual
that comes into the military

24:39.733 --> 24:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that wants to be able to serve.

24:41.766 --> 24:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are unique issues, not
just with a gay soldier or
member of the military, but of

24:45.300 --> 24:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
someone who is in transition.

24:46.733 --> 24:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You deal with medical issues.

24:48.766 --> 24:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You deal with a lot of
additional costs and
implementation, what
happens in a unit based

24:51.866 --> 24:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on that, because that's
-- as you know, that's
not a single surgery.

24:54.433 --> 24:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a series of
surgeries that happens.

24:56.133 --> 24:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a long time for them
to be away from their unit.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are additional
questions that are there that
are unique to that, whether that

25:01.566 --> 25:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individual should go through
transition before they come
into the military or after.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those things are still
up in the air, and the military
is walking through that right

25:08.433 --> 25:10.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

25:10.033 --> 25:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
James Lankford of
Oklahoma, we thank you.

25:12.166 --> 25:13.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:13.166 --> 25:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Great.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can
continue watching the Senate
as it votes on the health care

25:17.700 --> 25:19.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be live-streaming
throughout this night
on our Web site.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

25:34.466 --> 25:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that time of the year when
many folks flock to beaches,
resort towns and weekend

25:39.433 --> 25:41.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getaways.

25:41.466 --> 25:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those communities can be quite
dependent on foreign workers
to help staff them through

25:44.833 --> 25:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the summer season.

25:46.900 --> 25:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this year has a different
kind of pressure point, as the
Trump administration has pushed

25:51.233 --> 25:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for some big changes
on immigration rules.

25:54.833 --> 25:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has a look at the impact
of this supply-and-demand

25:59.733 --> 26:01.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

26:01.033 --> 26:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
series, Making Sense.

26:03.066 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ah, the
iconic seaside summer
getaway Provincetown
at the tip of Cape Cod.

26:11.133 --> 26:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A single mom prison guard in
New York state, Joy McNulty,
got away here to bring up her

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four kids in a safe
place and bought a tiny
restaurant, the Lobster Pot.

26:22.933 --> 26:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forty years later, the family
and about 100 hundred employees
serve 1,200 to 1,300 meals

26:29.033 --> 26:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a day during peak
season, prepared in the
back of the House by
six-month-a-year immigrants

26:33.733 --> 26:35.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Jamaica.

26:35.766 --> 26:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McNulty insisted I find out
for myself for how many years
they had been coming, 21 years,

26:42.166 --> 26:43.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
22 years.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're the new champ, 24.

26:46.266 --> 26:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That beats everybody.

26:48.266 --> 26:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Provincetown has a year-round
population of just under 3,000,
which swells to 10,000 in

26:52.500 --> 26:54.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the summer.

26:54.566 --> 26:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Add the estimated four to five
million tourists that visit the
Cape every year, and you have

26:59.700 --> 27:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got the poster child
for peak demand.

27:01.833 --> 27:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY, Owner, Lobster
Pot: How do you run a business
where all your kids work for

27:05.833 --> 27:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, all your grandchildren
work for you, and I don't
know if I can open next year?

27:09.666 --> 27:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could you do that?

27:11.800 --> 27:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: The problem
is getting Americans, of
any vintage, to do the
back of the housework.

27:18.366 --> 27:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So businesses here rely on
foreigners, says Jane Nichols
Bishop, known as Mama Visa to

27:22.733 --> 27:24.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the workers.

27:24.833 --> 27:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE NICHOLS BISHOP, Owner, Peak
Season Workforce: In a seasonal
economy, there are usually not

27:28.333 --> 27:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough American workers
to fill all of the jobs.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not year-round jobs.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the Congress allowed
something called an H-2B.

27:37.333 --> 27:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which allows
half-year work if no
one else can be found,
and must be renewed

27:44.200 --> 27:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
annually, for temporary
positions like hotel
housekeepers and
restaurant workers.

27:47.833 --> 27:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past, Congress has
made 66,000 of these visas
available annually nationwide.

27:54.866 --> 27:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And workers with previous H-2Bs,
like almost everyone here,
could return without being

28:01.266 --> 28:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counted against that
limit, but not this summer.

28:03.533 --> 28:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE NICHOLS BISHOP: Congress
didn't pass a returning worker
exemption in the continuing

28:10.100 --> 28:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
resolution to fund the
government, which is
where it's always been.

28:12.866 --> 28:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And because they didn't
do that, the number
of visas available was
greatly restricted.

28:19.833 --> 28:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there are not enough visas
for all the employers to
bring in their temporary work

28:24.333 --> 28:26.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

28:26.333 --> 28:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Department
of Homeland Security did add
another 15,000 visas last week.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But with the exemption
gone, the total number
of H-2Bs is way down.

28:37.433 --> 28:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with employers now having
to prove irreparable harm to get
one of the additional visas, the

28:42.500 --> 28:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paperwork that might,
or might not, get a
worker in has mushroomed.

28:47.733 --> 28:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What an irony for a supposedly
anti-red tape administration,
says Congressman Bill Keating,

28:53.600 --> 28:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who represents the Cape, though,
of course, he's from a district
even bluer than its fish.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

28:58.466 --> 28:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL KEATING (D),
Massachusetts: The fix is
staring us right in the face.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just raise the cap
on returning workers.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have done it for
the last 11 years.

29:03.833 --> 29:05.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It works.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But
they just did it now.

29:05.833 --> 29:06.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL KEATING: No, they didn't.

29:08.866 --> 29:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They created a whole new series
of regulations and requirements
that would scare any small

29:14.233 --> 29:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business person into not using
this because of politics.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

29:21.366 --> 29:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY: It's impossible to
run a business when you don't
know if you're getting 43 of

29:25.300 --> 29:27.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your 96 people.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The rest of them
are all Americans.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This year, we were
open six weeks late.

29:31.266 --> 29:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last week, we opened
six weeks late.

29:33.833 --> 29:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Next year, we may
not open at all.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

29:38.433 --> 29:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Gui Yingling got
none of the requested 26 H-2B
workers for nearby Bubala's

29:42.933 --> 29:44.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
By the Bay.

29:44.433 --> 29:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GUI YINGLING, Bubala's By the
Bay: It's been next impossible.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had to close days.

29:46.366 --> 29:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had to shorten hours.

29:48.466 --> 29:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And a corollary
problem, say restaurateurs
like Yingling and Mac Hay of

29:53.666 --> 29:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mac's Seafood, is that
if and when they close:

29:55.700 --> 30:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY, Owner, Mac's Seafood:
I would have to lay off way
more than half of the work

30:01.033 --> 30:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
force that I have now.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: American workers.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAC HAY: An American work force.

30:05.566 --> 30:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, look, they
say, it's not for lack of
trying, to recruit natives, that

30:08.133 --> 30:10.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

30:10.033 --> 30:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, the H-2B application
requires employers to
offer the jobs locally.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOY MCNULTY: I advertise
on the Internet.

30:16.633 --> 30:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I advertise in every job fair.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We advertise in every newspaper.

30:21.566 --> 30:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everyone on the entire
Cape knows that we're
all looking for help.

30:24.966 --> 30:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's nobody here.

30:26.600 --> 30:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They will not take
seasonal dishwashing and
cook jobs for anything.

30:33.233 --> 30:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But wait a second,
counters H-2B skeptic Jessica
Vaughan of the Center for

30:36.233 --> 30:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Immigration Studies.

30:38.366 --> 30:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA VAUGHAN, Center
for Immigration Studies:
I don't think there's
any such thing as a

30:39.333 --> 30:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
job an American won't do.

30:41.433 --> 30:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are millions of workers
in the United States who are
not employed, and we need to

30:48.400 --> 30:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
find a way to match them
up with some of these
opportunities as well.

30:51.500 --> 30:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Employers just
aren't trying hard enough,
Vaughan insists, while driving

30:55.333 --> 30:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down wages, and maybe
even working conditions.

30:58.466 --> 31:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More and more, she says,
teens and those with a high
school diploma at best:

31:02.300 --> 31:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: Employers
should look to those workers
first before they take the easy

31:08.466 --> 31:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
route out, and bring in
workers from overseas.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAC HAY: I have no
issue, no problem.

31:12.766 --> 31:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would prefer to do that.

31:15.366 --> 31:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trying to bring workers
from Jamaica or Mexico is
incredibly challenging,
incredibly expensive.

31:21.533 --> 31:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mac Hay worked in
kitchens on the Cape since he
was 12, now owns six businesses,

31:26.833 --> 31:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
restaurants and seafood markets.

31:28.233 --> 31:30.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The pay?

31:30.233 --> 31:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY: A dishwasher is
$12.50 to a cook can make $17,
$18 an hour, plus overtime.

31:34.966 --> 31:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not bad.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So why aren't these
summer jobs for students?

31:38.133 --> 31:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAC HAY: The majority of
them leave August 12 or
August 13 or August 14.

31:42.633 --> 31:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a 10-week season.

31:44.733 --> 31:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It runs through Labor Day.

31:46.800 --> 31:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't lose more than half
my work force with three weeks
to go, with 30 percent of

31:51.800 --> 31:53.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my season left.

31:53.333 --> 31:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And nonstudents
who are un- or under-employed?

31:55.400 --> 31:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY: Americans, they
don't want to relocate
their life for six months.

31:59.033 --> 32:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want to move down,
but if they're willing to do
it, I'm more than happy to hire

32:02.833 --> 32:04.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

32:04.866 --> 32:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like Joy McNulty
at the Lobster Pot, Mac Hay
utterly depends on visa workers.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Egan Bonny's been with
him for 10 seasons.

32:11.966 --> 32:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EGAN BONNY, Mac's Seafood: I do
cleaning, clean the restaurant
and do all kind of jobs

32:17.000 --> 32:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which no American kids
would come and do.

32:19.233 --> 32:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This grease job here,
fill the grease job.

32:21.466 --> 32:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No young kid's going to come
around and do this stuff.

32:27.700 --> 32:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Keep everything nice,
clean the bathroom.

32:28.933 --> 32:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because
they're spoiled?

32:30.033 --> 32:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EGAN BONNY: They're spoiled.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Seriously, they're spoiled.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

32:33.566 --> 32:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no wage at which
they would do these jobs?

32:35.633 --> 32:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUI YINGLING: I have hired
every employee who has tried
to walk through the door.

32:38.633 --> 32:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have advertised.

32:40.733 --> 32:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of them don't show up, is
the truth, once I hire them.

32:43.633 --> 32:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's pretty incredible.

32:45.166 --> 32:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had 17 employees no-show
this season, after being hired.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, we did
run into one underemployed
American worker.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what are you
doing this summer?

32:53.333 --> 32:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN, Student:
I'm working in a church
nursery every Sunday.

32:55.466 --> 32:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you have
applied for other jobs.

32:57.833 --> 32:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN:
Yes, that's right.

32:58.833 --> 33:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And?

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: I have not
heard back from any of them.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Seventeen-year
old Claire Vaughan lives
about two hours from the Cape.

33:05.133 --> 33:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So now,
why aren't you here?

33:07.666 --> 33:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: I didn't
know there were jobs here.

33:11.266 --> 33:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had no idea you could do that.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Claire Vaughan
happens to be the daughter
of our immigration skeptic.

33:16.433 --> 33:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: Now
that I know about it,
I will definitely look.

33:19.333 --> 33:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it turned
that she, like most students,
would have to leave before

33:23.033 --> 33:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the season was over.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And her parents didn't want
her living on the Cape.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we come to
the bottom line.

33:28.833 --> 33:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Bubala's is down 10
percent and may actually
lose money this year.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mac Hay worries about next year.

33:35.666 --> 33:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the Lobster Pot?

33:37.733 --> 33:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the six weeks it had to
close, it bought a lot fewer
lobsters from local fishermen,

33:43.833 --> 33:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hired fewer Americans
for fewer hours.

33:46.166 --> 33:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY: All of the
Americans are out of
work for six extra weeks.

33:50.433 --> 33:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state doesn't get the
taxes, the vendors don't get
the work, nothing happens here,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the town collapses.

33:58.433 --> 34:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But my people have been with me
for 20, 25 years, a lot of them.

34:04.366 --> 34:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What harm is that to anybody?

34:07.066 --> 34:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We just want to
run a restaurant.

34:09.300 --> 34:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting

34:13.266 --> 34:18.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Cape Cod.

34:19.133 --> 34:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

34:29.466 --> 34:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the
"NewsHour": from the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf, a war
correspondent's love of Africa;

34:35.833 --> 34:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a Brief But Spectacular
take on frivolous art.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As senators continue their
fight over health care, there
are new feuds bubbling on the

34:45.000 --> 34:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue.

34:47.600 --> 34:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From cracking down on
leaks to weighing Attorney
General Jeff Sessions'
future, and the president

34:53.800 --> 34:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
calling for an end to
transgender military
service members, the
White House is putting

34:57.200 --> 34:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out a number of fires this week.

34:59.266 --> 35:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We turn to Karine Jean-Pierre.

35:01.766 --> 35:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a senior adviser to
MoveOn.org and a veteran of
the Obama administration.

35:06.733 --> 35:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Matt Schlapp, he's
the chairman of the
American Conservative
Union and the former

35:11.033 --> 35:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deputy political director
for President George W. Bush.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And welcome to both of
you, Matt and Karine.

35:18.333 --> 35:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaking of fires, I have to
ask both of you first about a
story, a remarkable story that

35:25.300 --> 35:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has just appeared late
this afternoon in "The New
Yorker" magazine, Matt.

35:27.866 --> 35:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially it's the new
head of communications at
the White House, Anthony
Scaramucci, placing

35:32.666 --> 35:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a phone call last night
to the writer Ryan
Lizza and screaming at
him, wanting to know

35:39.700 --> 35:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who leaked information
about a dinner, using
very strong language,
threatening -- virtually

35:44.633 --> 35:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatening him, saying, I need
to know who the leakers are,
saying he's gone to the FBI,

35:49.133 --> 35:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Department of Justice.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's going on at
the White House?

35:52.666 --> 35:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White
House Director of Political
Affairs: Well, on my drive over

35:54.666 --> 35:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the studio, I was going to
have my 14-year-old daughter
read this article to me.

35:56.233 --> 35:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm glad I didn't,
because it does have
some colorful language.

35:58.666 --> 36:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Anthony Scaramucci
is already out on
Twitter apologizing
for the language, but

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the key here is
that this whole question
of leaks inside the
West Wing, it is a real

36:09.533 --> 36:11.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for those of us who want
President Trump to succeed in
his agenda, to succeed, it's

36:15.300 --> 36:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a real distraction to
getting the agenda through.

36:18.366 --> 36:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Scaramucci's trying
to take care of the leaks,
and, unfortunately, he thought

36:25.733 --> 36:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was having a conversation
that was off-the-record,
but apparently he didn't
make that clear to

36:28.066 --> 36:30.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reporter.

36:30.166 --> 36:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, what
does it say when you have this
level of leaking and animosity

36:34.033 --> 36:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going on inside the
White House this early
in the administration?

36:37.533 --> 36:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE,
Democratic Strategist:
Well, it's quite insane.

36:40.333 --> 36:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worked in the White House
in the Obama administration.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never seen
anything like this before.

36:45.633 --> 36:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if this is Scaramucci's
role, is to take care of the
leaks, that's really going to

36:52.000 --> 36:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a full-time job for him.

36:54.033 --> 36:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, honestly, Judy, if he is
-- if that is something that
he's truly working on, he needs

36:58.066 --> 36:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to start in the Oval Office.

36:59.533 --> 37:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He needs to start from
the top all the way down.

37:02.033 --> 37:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's where the leaks are.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not the junior staffers.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the senior staffers,
starting with Donald
Trump, the president.

37:08.566 --> 37:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the senior staffers are
just trying the save their jobs.

37:11.866 --> 37:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why they're
leaking the way that they are.

37:14.700 --> 37:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, also, this is a reason
why for the first six months of
the administration, that this

37:21.133 --> 37:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration has not been
able to get anything done.

37:23.133 --> 37:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have not really passed
one piece of major legislation,
because of stuff like this.

37:30.033 --> 37:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, what
about that, the fact that it's
just -- it's not just -- it's

37:32.066 --> 37:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not lower-level people who
are talking to the press; it's
people up and down and going

37:35.300 --> 37:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the way to the top
of the White House?

37:36.566 --> 37:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes.

37:38.233 --> 37:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I mean, there are
always leaks that come
out of the White House.

37:40.333 --> 37:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, those leaks are
intended to inform the press in
kind of an anonymous fashion.

37:46.466 --> 37:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what's happened in the
Trump White House, it's just a
melee of weeks, where people are

37:49.366 --> 37:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaking on each other
in the West Wing.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

37:53.333 --> 37:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think that the
White House - - the West Wing
wasn't set up to be efficient

37:58.400 --> 38:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and successful from
the very beginning.

38:00.500 --> 38:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they actually can look
at the way that they set up
the West Wing, and there's

38:04.900 --> 38:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not a kind of a sheriff in town.

38:06.933 --> 38:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember, when I worked for
Andy Card in the West Wing,
and he told me, especially

38:09.100 --> 38:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I took the job as political
director, he said, if you
miss -- if you overstep your

38:13.266 --> 38:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust with the president, there
will be a cardboard box on
your desk, fill it and leave.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Well, I was struck.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just...

38:20.700 --> 38:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Now, he didn't
do that to me, but he would
have done it had I overstepped

38:22.166 --> 38:24.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the boundaries.

38:24.233 --> 38:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to stay
with you just a moment, Matt,
because there is a line in

38:25.766 --> 38:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that really strikes me.

38:27.700 --> 38:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan Lizza with "The New
Yorker" writes, he said: "Unlike
other Trump advisers, I have

38:31.133 --> 38:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never heard him," meaning
Scaramucci, "say a bad
word about the president."

38:35.500 --> 38:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he's saying everybody
else is criticizing the
president who hired them.

38:39.666 --> 38:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, I don't
want the get into - - I don't
know these conversations.

38:43.166 --> 38:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I can tell you is that
one of the issues, as the West
Wing was pulled together, the

38:47.266 --> 38:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staff was pulled together, is
it was kind of an interesting
concoction of people that

38:51.600 --> 38:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weren't really with the
president's campaign.

38:54.200 --> 38:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he did pull together people,
maybe in the hopes to kind
of like bring kind of unity

38:59.066 --> 39:01.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the party.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it has always been fearful
that you had people who were
either never-Trump or didn't

39:04.766 --> 39:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have much respect for the Trump
-- for President Trump who got
senior administration positions.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I worked for a Republican
president who I admired and
who I loved and I would have

39:14.966 --> 39:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just done almost anything for
professionally, and when you
don't have that spirit with some

39:21.100 --> 39:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staffers, it can cause
a lot of problems.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, I know
I'm asking you as an outsider
and somebody from the other

39:25.166 --> 39:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party to weigh in on this, but
do you see a solution here?

39:29.066 --> 39:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
No, not at all.

39:32.233 --> 39:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think I have said this
before on your show, Judy,
which is the fish rots at his

39:35.833 --> 39:37.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the type of environment
that Donald Trump has set up.

39:39.900 --> 39:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's brought in the
corporate life, the way he
was as a CEO, as the head
of Trump Organization,

39:45.400 --> 39:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and brought it into
the White House.

39:46.233 --> 39:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He loves this stuff.

39:47.633 --> 39:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He loves the inter-fighting.

39:49.933 --> 39:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He likes when they're fighting
for his -- the dear leader
affection of Donald Trump.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it's not going
to -- it doesn't matter
if it's Scaramucci.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't matter who it is.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't matter if
Priebus stays or leaves.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It starts with the person at the
top, and that's Donald Trump.

40:04.633 --> 40:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, one
other -- two other things I
want to ask you both about,

40:07.200 --> 40:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but first the announcement
by Twitter yesterday
from the president that
he wanted to ban all

40:13.600 --> 40:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who are transgender
from serving in the military.

40:16.133 --> 40:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Matt, I want to go back
and remind -- show everybody in
our audience, this is what the

40:20.700 --> 40:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president had to say last year,
just a year ago, that this
was the day after the Orlando

40:26.733 --> 40:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nightclub shooting.

40:28.833 --> 40:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave a national security
speech in New Hampshire, and
here's what he had to say.

40:32.200 --> 40:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Ask yourself,
who is really the friend of

40:39.300 --> 40:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
women and the LB -- and
LGBT community, Donald
Trump, with actions, or
Hillary Clinton, with

40:46.133 --> 40:48.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her words?

40:48.200 --> 40:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will tell you who the better
friend is, and, someday, I
believe that will be proven

40:54.133 --> 40:56.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out bigly.

40:56.066 --> 40:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Matt,
how do you explain the
transgender military decision?

40:59.266 --> 41:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, for
seven-and-a-half years of
the Obama administration,
they had a prohibition

41:05.633 --> 41:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that equates to what
President Trump announced.

41:07.433 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, all we have is a tweet.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know what
it means in detail.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what it means for
the people serving, but you
get to this basic question,

41:14.533 --> 41:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, which is, you know,
what do the commanders
want in the field, right?

41:18.033 --> 41:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that what was
intended by this administration,
at least what Sarah Huckabee

41:22.833 --> 41:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders said, to expand upon the
tweet, was that he is listening
to the services and what

41:28.433 --> 41:30.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for seven-and-a-half years
in the Obama administration,
they had a similar plan, not

41:32.900 --> 41:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I think there was
animus towards transgender
people or the gay community.

41:39.866 --> 41:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was because they were
simply focusing on what generals
were saying they needed to

41:42.366 --> 41:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be ready in the field.

41:43.733 --> 41:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this will all be
handled in Congress.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The funding all goes through
Congress, and we will have a
democratic debate on whether

41:49.566 --> 41:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or not this should
happen or not.

41:51.633 --> 41:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, General Joe Dunford,

41:54.366 --> 41:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said today that -- they said,
we're waiting for guidance.

41:58.166 --> 42:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we want to
continue to respect
everybody in the military.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
That's right, Judy.

42:03.333 --> 42:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, usually, when
you make this type of
policy, you articulate
it on paper, you create

42:09.200 --> 42:10.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a policy.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't tweet about it.

42:11.866 --> 42:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the Pentagon can't
actually act on this.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can't act on a tweet.

42:16.266 --> 42:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were never given
a piece of policy.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, once again, you have
a president who doesn't care
to learn, who doesn't know how

42:23.433 --> 42:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the process works, and
he uses Twitter to put --
to really feed his base.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what we're seeing.

42:31.766 --> 42:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, the other part about
this, too, is that he made that
promise during the election.

42:35.233 --> 42:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was an outrageous
comment when we heard it.

42:37.966 --> 42:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one ever -- no one
really, truly believed it.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it became a lie on day
one of his administration.

42:43.533 --> 42:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not an administration
that cares about brown people,
black people or transgendered

42:49.300 --> 42:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or LGBT communities.

42:50.433 --> 42:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen this -- or women.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt?

42:53.633 --> 42:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I don't think
that accurately describes
Donald Trump's heart.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have talked to him about
these sets of issues.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven-and-a-half years
of the Obama administration,
they had the very same policy.

43:01.333 --> 43:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that President
Obama was discriminating
for those seven-and-a-half

43:04.700 --> 43:05.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think the
next question on...

43:07.966 --> 43:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
it was only at the end when
they changed the policy.

43:09.166 --> 43:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: They
changed it at the end.

43:11.100 --> 43:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, the military
hasn't understood how
to implement this.

43:13.133 --> 43:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Secretary of Defense
Mattis and all of the service
chiefs knew that they were in

43:18.666 --> 43:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the process of review.

43:19.633 --> 43:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have been discussing this.

43:21.733 --> 43:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who track this issue knew
that they were trying to figure
out, could this be implemented

43:25.266 --> 43:26.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

43:26.500 --> 43:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
still no paper.

43:27.266 --> 43:29.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was a tweet.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well,
the announcement is
completely unconventional.

43:31.233 --> 43:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard for somebody
like me to even explain
what the implications are.

43:34.566 --> 43:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The country needs
the details on this.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think Karine's point
on that is very fair.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
finally, to both of you, Karine.

43:41.800 --> 43:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You expect the attorney general
to stay where he is, Jeff
Sessions, given what's going on?

43:46.400 --> 43:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Well, I will try to be
really quick here, Judy.

43:49.400 --> 43:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Look, I do not think the
attorney general should
be the attorney general.

43:52.600 --> 43:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think he is a racist.

43:53.900 --> 43:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he has
racist background.

43:56.533 --> 43:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he lied and perjured
himself in front of Congress.

43:59.700 --> 44:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's not the reason
why Donald Trump doesn't
want him in the job anymore.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't want him in the job
because of the Russia thing.

44:05.933 --> 44:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants -- he was upset
that Sessions didn't
recuse himself, and he
wants to fire Bob Mueller.

44:12.500 --> 44:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why he wants to
get rid of Sessions.

44:14.566 --> 44:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: President Trump
doesn't want Jeff Sessions to
leave the office of the attorney

44:19.000 --> 44:21.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what President Trump
is saying is, he's frustrated
that a special counsel was

44:23.666 --> 44:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked without it even being
run by Jeff Sessions, and
that that investigation
seems to be overshadowing

44:29.333 --> 44:31.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his presidency.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have seen the leaks
that have come out against
Donald Trump, when you have seen

44:34.333 --> 44:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the DNC has a
staffer that's worked
with the government of
Ukraine, there are plenty

44:37.400 --> 44:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things on the other side
of the ledger that I think
Republicans would like to see

44:41.066 --> 44:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOJ look at as well.

44:43.100 --> 44:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's been pretty
tough on this attorney general,
though, the last few days.

44:45.966 --> 44:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: He has been.

44:48.233 --> 44:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

44:50.033 --> 44:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt
Schlapp, Karine
Jean-Pierre, thank you both.

44:50.966 --> 44:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you, Judy.

44:53.333 --> 44:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, Judy.

45:00.133 --> 45:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
close tonight with two
affectionate looks at Africa.

45:06.466 --> 45:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First, a journalist's
love of the continent,
family and his craft.

45:13.466 --> 45:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown begins with
our latest addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

45:15.966 --> 45:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As a
19-year-old college
student, Jeffrey Gettleman
traveled to East Africa

45:18.866 --> 45:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fell in love with a place.

45:20.766 --> 45:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also fell in love that
year with a woman back home.

45:23.533 --> 45:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their time together and apart,
and his life and work covering
a continent as a Pulitzer

45:30.533 --> 45:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prize-winning correspondent for
The New York Times, make up the
story told in "Love, Africa:

45:33.233 --> 45:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A Memoir of Romance,
War, and Survival."

45:36.533 --> 45:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Gettleman joins me now.

45:38.100 --> 45:40.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

45:40.133 --> 45:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN,
Author, "Love, Africa: A
Memoir of Romance, War,
and Survival": Thank

45:40.666 --> 45:42.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

45:42.766 --> 45:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is a place,
a region that you have looked
at for a long time in a certain

45:43.700 --> 45:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voice, right, as journalist.

45:45.600 --> 45:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now you're presenting
a different voice.

45:49.266 --> 45:51.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is this?

45:51.333 --> 45:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Well, I feel
very conflicted about my work
sometimes in Africa, because,

45:54.400 --> 45:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as journalists, we
focus on conflict.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We focus on argument
and dispute.

45:58.766 --> 46:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is
the way we hear about
Africa most of the time.

46:02.333 --> 46:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: And this
is true for all journalists.

46:04.600 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my job as a journalist
in East Africa, I'm often
steeped in these conflicts.

46:11.033 --> 46:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that wasn't why I came to
East Africa in the first place.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came on a safari as
a student and was blown
away by the warmth, by
the sense of connectedness

46:19.700 --> 46:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between people, like, just
a different way of life.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so this book, to me,
is a bit of an escape.

46:26.333 --> 46:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, often, we get
frustrated with what's
happening in today's world.

46:32.766 --> 46:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We feel sort of the woes
of the world on our back.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wanted to write a book
that celebrated something
that meant a lot to me.

46:38.566 --> 46:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were
drawn to this place.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't real obvious why.

46:43.666 --> 46:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: I think,
thinking more deeply about
what it was that really moved

46:47.900 --> 46:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, it was experiencing a
part of the world that's very
different from how I grew up in

46:52.466 --> 46:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suburban Chicago, how most
of us grew up, a lot poorer,
a lot less developed.

46:59.433 --> 47:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was this spirit,
this sense of warmth and
openness among people.

47:05.266 --> 47:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though I had so much more
than the people I was around,
I felt very little resentment.

47:09.466 --> 47:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I felt very little bitterness.

47:11.500 --> 47:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt welcome in a part of
the world that couldn't be
any more different from what I

47:16.633 --> 47:18.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experienced.

47:18.733 --> 47:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is a
kind of fraught situation of
writing about Africa always,

47:21.633 --> 47:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right, how to
write about Africa.

47:23.933 --> 47:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to deal with that, as
a journalist and in this case.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: And I was
trying to be honest about that
in this book, because there's

47:30.066 --> 47:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many books written by
passing correspondents.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the term in Africa
is mzungu, which means
white man, like gringo.

47:36.966 --> 47:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I cover these conflicts, I go
into a famine zone, I go into
a part of South Sudan where

47:41.200 --> 47:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are killing each
other, and they're stuck.

47:43.533 --> 47:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their houses have been burned.

47:44.900 --> 47:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have lost everything
they have owned.

47:46.633 --> 47:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have lost loved ones.

47:48.800 --> 47:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're sharing their misery
with me, and I am dutifully
recording it in my notebook,

47:53.500 --> 47:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then transmitting
it to the world.

47:55.533 --> 47:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I get on a plane and
take off, and go back to my
wife and kids and my comfortable

47:59.233 --> 48:00.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

48:00.700 --> 48:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's morally
problematic in some ways.

48:03.833 --> 48:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that's my role.

48:05.400 --> 48:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We all have our roles.

48:06.900 --> 48:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The aid workers have their
roles in delivering aid.

48:08.600 --> 48:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The militaries have their
role in providing security.

48:11.366 --> 48:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a journalist, my role
is to just try and gather as
much material, and open a window

48:17.500 --> 48:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to a different
part of the world.

48:19.566 --> 48:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, in this
book, there is the other part
of the love story, which is

48:22.433 --> 48:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your wife, who you
now go home too.

48:25.566 --> 48:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're open about the
problems of a marriage amid
the life you are leading.

48:32.100 --> 48:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She leaves behind a
life as a lawyer to
come and work with you.

48:35.833 --> 48:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: i think what
we struggled with is what a
lot of young people struggle

48:39.800 --> 48:41.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were both really determined
to pursue our careers.

48:42.933 --> 48:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was dead set on being a
criminal defense attorney.

48:45.733 --> 48:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really wanted to
be a journalist.

48:47.866 --> 48:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had to go where the jobs
took us, and we did a lot of
damage to our relationship.

48:51.933 --> 48:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we didn't respect and honor
what we suspected that we had,
which was a very special bond.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were years that we
screwed it up, and we threw
away a lot of time together.

49:02.533 --> 49:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's not
giving away the ending to say
that it worked out, right?

49:06.266 --> 49:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Yes, we
were lucky enough to finally
sort of see which way is up.

49:12.300 --> 49:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have a wonderful
life in Kenya.

49:13.566 --> 49:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a great place
to raise a family.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have two little boys
that were born there.

49:16.800 --> 49:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you want
to convey here that we either
miss as viewer or watchers

49:23.300 --> 49:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the world, or that
America itself misses,
right, in its policy?

49:26.533 --> 49:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN:
Where do I begin?

49:28.133 --> 49:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OK, a couple quick things.

49:30.733 --> 49:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, in a lot of these
really bad situations,
there is an undercurrent
of hope, and of dignity,

49:36.566 --> 49:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and of humanity, and community.

49:38.766 --> 49:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, I covered the
Westgate Mall massacre, where
some terrorists came into

49:42.733 --> 49:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a crowded mall in Nairobi, and
gunned down dozens of people.

49:46.566 --> 49:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't kill more people,
because there was a response by
neighborhood police officers,

49:53.533 --> 49:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were much more lightly
armed than these terrorists
that had assault rifles.

49:56.266 --> 50:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these guys went streaming
into this mall, under fire, with
these cheap pistols, fighting

50:02.133 --> 50:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against these terrorists.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were taking shots, they
were getting hit, they were
getting wounded, and they kept

50:06.466 --> 50:08.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

50:08.466 --> 50:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These guys came in as
basically volunteers,
and saved a lot of lives.

50:11.600 --> 50:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even in this moment, that
was there was still an element
of humanity, and community,

50:17.766 --> 50:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and pulling together
at the right time.

50:19.866 --> 50:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have seen that in war
zones, and in battle zones,
and in famine situations.

50:24.500 --> 50:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one other thing I think is,
a lot of the problems in Africa
are because of things that

50:31.333 --> 50:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened outside of
Africa, or because of
American policy especially.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wrote a bit in
this book about the
mistakes that the American
government has made under

50:38.633 --> 50:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different administrations.

50:40.066 --> 50:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't a Republican
problem or a Democrat problem.

50:42.700 --> 50:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was kind of a
lack of interest.

50:44.966 --> 50:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the results were famine,
and chaos, and pirates.

50:49.233 --> 50:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some of that was because of
specific decisions the American
government had made that were

50:55.466 --> 50:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad decisions and led to
a whole chain of events.

50:57.533 --> 51:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in this part of the world,
a lot of people aren't paying
that close of attention.

51:00.833 --> 51:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I felt that it was my
responsibility to write a very
personal book, an accessible

51:04.966 --> 51:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
book, a kind of escape,
adventure story, but
to do some educating.

51:09.566 --> 51:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
the book is "Love, Africa."

51:13.033 --> 51:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Gettleman,
thank you very much.

51:14.033 --> 51:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Thank you.

51:16.466 --> 51:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Read Jeffrey
Gettleman's reflections
on closing The New
York Times' East Africa

51:20.900 --> 51:22.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bureau.

51:22.100 --> 51:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His essay was published
by The Times today.

51:25.200 --> 51:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And staying on the subject
of Africa, we turn to
another in our Brief
But Spectacular series,

51:31.366 --> 51:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where we ask people to
describe their passions.

51:33.466 --> 51:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Kenyan filmmaker Wanuri
Kahiu, who's using a new style
to tell modern African stories.

51:39.966 --> 51:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANURI KAHIU, Filmmaker: I am
a filmmaker and storyteller.

51:43.666 --> 51:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have made films
and written stories
about rusted robots that
fall in love, Nairobi

51:50.700 --> 51:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pop bands that want to go to
space, girls who want to race
camels in the future, girls

51:57.033 --> 52:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who want to dance in the
future, anything that's fun,
fizz, and frivolous coming out

52:00.266 --> 52:04.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Africa.

52:04.200 --> 52:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A couple of years ago, I was
writing a love story, and I
was looking for funding for it.

52:12.833 --> 52:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I said I was
looking for a love
story, and I approached
investors, one of them to

52:19.733 --> 52:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, if you add a rape
scene, then we might be able
to get you some funding.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this was devastating to me.

52:25.366 --> 52:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It felt as if Africans just
can't fall in love or be joyous.

52:30.200 --> 52:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There has to be some sort of
tragedy linked to their love.

52:33.433 --> 52:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I completely,
completely reject that idea.

52:36.400 --> 52:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I pushed back with this
idea of Afro Bubble Gum art
that means we can be just for

52:43.033 --> 52:44.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being's sake.

52:44.266 --> 52:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can just create
for creating's sake.

52:46.166 --> 52:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't have
to have an issue.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I always knew I wanted
to create stories.

52:51.066 --> 52:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the more I started to
create, I started to realize
that I wasn't seeing myself in

52:56.666 --> 52:58.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these films.

52:58.766 --> 53:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I could do was write stories
that represented the people
that I knew and the people that

53:02.133 --> 53:04.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I grew up with.

53:04.166 --> 53:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I didn't realize at
the time that I was making
a political statement.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was just making films
with black people in them.

53:09.433 --> 53:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's so important to
see diversity in front of the
camera, if for no other reason

53:16.400 --> 53:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that, when my daughter
asks me about the princesses
that she sees, and she doesn't

53:18.566 --> 53:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see any black princesses, I
can say, well, there's others.

53:22.833 --> 53:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, thank God for Doc
McStuffins, who's completely
saved my daughter's
life, because she can

53:29.000 --> 53:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
finally see an image of
herself on the screen.

53:31.600 --> 53:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we work to represent other
people, so that the children
who grow up after my children

53:36.566 --> 53:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can also see images of
themselves, so that they can see
that they belong in the world

53:41.533 --> 53:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they live in as well.

53:44.200 --> 53:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
