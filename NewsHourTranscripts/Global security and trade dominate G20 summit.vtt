HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening
and thanks for joining us.

00:04.033 --> 00:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Global security and trade
dominated the two-day
summit of leaders from
20 nations that concluded

00:07.000 --> 00:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Germany today.

00:08.966 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The G-20 meeting in Hamburg
drew large crowds of protesters,
as these gatherings always

00:13.266 --> 00:14.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

00:14.466 --> 00:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that did not disrupt
the business inside.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NewsHour Weekend special
correspondent Ryan Chilcote
is there with more.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Today, president
trump met with key Asian
allies to discuss the ongoing

00:26.366 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threat posed by North Korea and
its long-range missile program.

00:29.433 --> 00:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe called the situation
"increasingly severe."

00:33.633 --> 00:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a separate meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping,
President Trump said of North

00:38.400 --> 00:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea's continuing weapons
tests: "Something has
to be done about it."

00:42.600 --> 00:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leaders also discussed
trade deals and the
$30 billion-a-month
U.S. trade deficit

00:45.666 --> 00:48.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with China.

00:48.266 --> 00:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Many things have happened
that have led to trade
imbalances, and we're

00:49.233 --> 00:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to turn that around.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that with China, in
particular, which is a great
trading partner, we will be able

00:52.800 --> 00:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do something that will
equitable and reciprocal.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Meeting with
British Prime Minister Theresa
May, Mr. Trump said the U.S.

00:59.333 --> 01:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and UK were also working also
on what he called a "very
powerful" trade deal as the UK

01:05.533 --> 01:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plans its exit from
the European Union.

01:07.666 --> 01:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Prime Minister May and
I have developed a very
special relationship,

01:11.100 --> 01:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think trade will be a
very big factor between our two
countries, so I want to thank

01:18.600 --> 01:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much."

01:20.700 --> 01:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: In the summit's
final communique, 19 of the 20
nations - all but the united

01:27.000 --> 01:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states - vowed to implement
quickly and without exceptions
the Paris climate accord

01:30.200 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions that
cause global warming.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said the U.S.
position is "regrettable."

01:37.566 --> 01:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL:
Therefore there is the position
of the United States on the

01:41.533 --> 01:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one hand, but I am very
happy that all other
G20 heads of states and
government have agreed

01:47.666 --> 01:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the Paris agreement
is irreversible."

01:49.666 --> 01:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Merkel played
down the moment when first
daughter Ivanka Trump sat in for

01:52.666 --> 01:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the president during a
meeting about migration
and health in Africa.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said the
U.S. would give $50 million
to a World Bank fund
for women entrepreneurs

02:02.966 --> 02:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in developing countries.

02:05.033 --> 02:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Following yesterday's marathon
meeting between President Trump
and Russian President Vladimir

02:09.066 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin, today I asked Mr.
Putin if he felt Mr. Trump had
agreed with his face-to-face

02:13.900 --> 02:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assertion that Russia
had not intervened in the
U.S. election last year.

02:18.666 --> 02:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR
PUTIN: He was really
interested in the details.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I replied as
detailed as I could.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he was satisfied
with my answers.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our position is known.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are no grounds for
saying Russia interfered
in the U.S. election.

02:34.533 --> 02:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND ANCHOR:
Our special correspondent
Ryan Chilcote joins

02:38.066 --> 02:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me now from Hamburg, Germany.

02:40.133 --> 02:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan, let's start with that
meeting between Vladimir Putin
and President Donald Trump.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who controlled the
narrative afterwards on
what exactly happened there?

02:48.666 --> 02:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE, PBS NEWSHOUR
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:
What we can say is
that at least from the

02:52.800 --> 02:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian side, there was
more of a narrative.

02:54.866 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think about it, almost
immediately following President
Trump and President Putin's

03:01.800 --> 03:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting, the Russian foreign
minister gave a press conference
that was broadcast live

03:04.566 --> 03:06.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Russian TV.

03:06.666 --> 03:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the U.S. side, U.S. Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson a
while later addressed U.S.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporters but it was audio only.

03:14.633 --> 03:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then if you think about
today, President Putin gave
a press conference after - as

03:21.266 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he was leaving.

03:22.966 --> 03:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He answered a question from me.

03:25.500 --> 03:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He too said that President
Trump, by the way,
it was his impression
agreed that Russia hadn't

03:31.366 --> 03:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intervened in the election.

03:33.133 --> 03:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
While as the U.S. delegation,
President Trump simply left.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't have a
press conference at all.

03:39.566 --> 03:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Russians have
certainly been talking about
the meeting a lot more.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, you know, that's
given them an opportunity to
shape how people characterize

03:50.566 --> 03:52.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: One of the story
lines that we've also been
seeing or images of the protests

03:55.333 --> 03:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have been happening
in Hamburg, how
significant have they been?

03:58.233 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: I think it's fair
to say that the protests
here - and I've been to many,

04:01.733 --> 04:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many, many G20s, G7s - have
really engulfed this city.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a big city, right?

04:07.566 --> 04:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is Germany's
second largest city.

04:10.766 --> 04:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really quite large and
these protests were everywhere.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone said before this summit
began that it was a gamble
on Angela Merkel, the German

04:20.800 --> 04:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chancellor's part to have
this, to have the summit here
in this city, as opposed as

04:27.833 --> 04:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they often do, you know, on
some remote island where it's
difficult for protesters to do

04:32.766 --> 04:34.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

04:34.866 --> 04:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But apparently, she wanted to
send a message to President
Erdogan and other leaders that

04:38.366 --> 04:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Germany is a democratic country
and this is going to go ahead,
which is one of the reasons

04:41.733 --> 04:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they didn't crack down
as much as they could on
some of these protesters.

04:45.733 --> 04:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Is there a way to
judge the standing of the United
States, given that this is now

04:49.800 --> 04:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the president's - one
of his first major
international forays?

04:54.100 --> 04:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: Well, there's a
real qualitative difference
between what we've seen at this

04:57.700 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summit when it comes to U.S.
leadership and how everyone has
sort of perceived and received

05:03.800 --> 05:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. from the other
summits I've been.

05:06.466 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summit has been
mostly about other G20
leaders trying to convince
the Trump administration

05:13.700 --> 05:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find some, you know, middle
ground with them on issues
like trade and particularly

05:19.566 --> 05:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the issue of climate change.

05:21.433 --> 05:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, it's a real stark
change from what we've
seen in the past.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

05:26.866 --> 05:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ryan Chilcote joining
us tonight from Hamburg,
Germany, thanks so much.

05:28.833 --> 05:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Thank you.
